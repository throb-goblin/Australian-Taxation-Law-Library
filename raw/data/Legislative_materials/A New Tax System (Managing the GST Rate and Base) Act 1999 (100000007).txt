PartÂ 3âChanging the rate and base of GST

11  Changing the rate and base of GST

      (1)   The rate of the GST, and the GST base, are not to be changed
         unless each State agrees to the change. Such changes to the GST
         base should be consistent with:
      (a)   maintaining the integrity of the GST base; and
      (b)   administrative simplicity; and
      (c)   minimising compliance costs for taxpayers.

      (2)   In particular, but without limiting subsectionÂ (1), a Minister
         may only make a determination under the GST Act, or the A New Tax
         System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Act 1999, that affects
         the GST base if the determination is made in accordance with a
         procedure to which all of the States have agreed.

      (3)   This section does not apply to the changes to the GST base that
         are contained in legislation introduced, or regulations or other
         instruments made, before 1Â July 2001 if the changes are:
      (a)   of an administrative nature; and
      (b)   necessary to facilitate minor adjustments to the GST; and
      (c)   made having regard to the need to protect the revenue of the
             States.

      (4)   Also, this section does not apply to later changes to the GST
         base if the changes are of an administrative nature and are
         approved by a majority of the Commonwealth and the States.

12  Definitions

      (1)   In this Part:

         rate of the GST is the rate of tax specified in the GST Imposition
         Acts.

      (2)   A change is of an administrative nature only if the change is
         necessary to:
      (a)   maintain the integrity of the GST base; or
      (b)   prevent tax avoidance.

Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006
      (No.Â 101, 2006)

Schedule 6

1  Application of ScheduleÂ 1 and 2 amendments
      Except as mentioned in itemsÂ 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made
      by SchedulesÂ 1 and 2 apply:
      (a)   so far as they affect assessmentsâto assessments for the 2006-
             07 income year and all later income years; and
      (b)   otherwiseâto acts done or omitted to be done, or states of
             affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and
             amendments.

6  Object
      The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and
      amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative
      consequences of:
      (a)   any act done or omitted to be done; or
      (b)   any state of affairs existing; or
      (c)   any period ending;
      before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and
      be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of
      steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal
      or amendment applies.

7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to
      past matters
      Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or
      amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following
      under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the
      Legislative Instruments Act 2003):
      (a)   making or amending an assessment (including under a provision
             that is itself repealed or amended);
      (b)   exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or
             duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that
             is itself repealed or amended);
      in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of
      affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment
      applies.

         Example 1:    On 31Â July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return
                under former sectionÂ 160ARE of the Income Tax Assessment Act
                1936. The return stated that the company had a credit on its
                franking account and that no franking deficit tax was
                payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former
                sectionÂ 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to
                have made an assessment consistent with the return.

            Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of PartÂ IIIAA of
                that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd
                fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-
                99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for
                that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers
                that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional
                tax are payable.

            The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former
                sectionÂ 160ARN of that Act, because itemÂ 7 of this Schedule
                disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of
                making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking
                year. ItemÂ 7 will also disregard the repeal of DivisionÂ 11
                of former PartÂ IIIAA to the extent necessary for the
                Commissioner to assess Greg Ltdâs liability to a penalty by
                way of additional tax.

            Despite the repeal of sectionsÂ 160ARU and 160ARV, itemÂ 9 will
                ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the
                unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

            ItemÂ 7 will also preserve Greg Ltdâs right, under former
                sectionÂ 160ART of that Act, to object against the
                Commissionerâs amended assessment (including the penalty),
                since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation
                to a franking year that ended before the repeal of
                PartÂ IIIAA.

         Example 2:    During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd
                withheld amounts from its employeesâ wages as required by
                former DivisionsÂ 1AAA and 2 of PartÂ VI of the Income Tax
                Assessment Act 1936. The company failed to notify the
                Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to
                the Commissioner.

            Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those
                Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld
                amounts have not been remitted. The companyâs records are
                incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely
                ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld
                amounts. Under sectionÂ 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner
                makes an estimate of the liability.

            ItemÂ 7 will disregard the repeal of sectionÂ 220AAZA of that Act
                (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of
                the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the
                repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments
      If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by
      this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or
      amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or
      after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or
      omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period
      ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify
      penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty
      If:
      (a)   a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended
             by this Act provides for the payment of:
      (i)   general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late
                reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of
                the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936); or
      (ii)  interest under the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early
                Payments) Act 1983; and
      (b)   in a particular case, the period in respect of which the
             charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the
             provision or under the Taxation Administration Act 1953) has
             not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is
             repealed or amended;
      then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues
      to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions
      If the operation of a provision (the subject provision) of any Act or
      legislative instrument (within the meaning of the Legislative
      Instruments Act 2003) made under any Act depends to any extent on an
      Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the
      repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the
      subject provision.

11  Schedule does not limit operation of sectionÂ 8 of the Acts
      Interpretation Act 1901
      This Schedule does not limit the operation of sectionÂ 8 of the Acts
      Interpretation Act 1901.

1  Payments for the 2008-09 GST year
      Despite the amendments to the A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State
      Financial Arrangements) Act 1999 made by this Act, that Act continues
