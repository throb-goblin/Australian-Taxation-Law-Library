PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 11
Wages that are taxable in this jurisdiction
 
 
11 Wages that are taxable in this jurisdiction
     (1) For the purposes of this Act, wages are taxable in this
     jurisdiction if--
          (a) the wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in
          relation to services performed by an employee wholly in
          this jurisdiction, or
          (b) the wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in
          relation to services performed by an employee in 2 or more
          Australian jurisdictions, or partly in one or more
          Australian jurisdictions and partly outside all Australian
          jurisdictions, and--
               (i) the employee is based in this jurisdiction,
               or
               (ii) the employer is based in this jurisdiction
               (in a case where the employee is not based in an
               Australian jurisdiction), or
               (iii) the wages are paid or payable in this
               jurisdiction (in a case where both the employee
               and the employer are not based in an Australian
               jurisdiction), or
               (iv) the wages are paid or payable for services
               performed mainly in this jurisdiction (in a case
               where both the employee and the employer are not
               based in an Australian jurisdiction and the wages
               are not paid or payable in an Australian
               jurisdiction), or
          (c) the wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in
          relation to services performed by an employee wholly
          outside all Australian jurisdictions and are paid or
          payable in this jurisdiction.
          Note : Section 66A provides an exemption for wages paid or
          payable for services performed wholly in one or more other
          countries for a continuous period of more than 6 months.
     (2) The question of whether wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is
     to be determined by reference only to the services performed by the
     employee in respect of the employer during the month in which the
     wages are paid or payable, subject to this section.
     (3) Any wages paid or payable by an employer in respect of an
     employee in a particular month are taken to be paid or payable for or
     in relation to the services performed by the employee in respect of
     the employer during that month.
          Note : For example, if wages paid in a month are paid to an
          employee for services performed over several months, the
          question of whether the wages are taxable in this
          jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to
          services performed by the employee in the month in which
          the wages are paid. The services performed in previous
          months are disregarded. (The services performed in previous
          months will be relevant to the question of whether wages
          paid in those previous months are taxable in this
          jurisdiction.)
     (4) If no services are performed by an employee in respect of an
     employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable to or in
     relation to the employee--
          (a) the question of whether the wages are taxable in this
          jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to the
          services performed by the employee in respect of the
          employer during the most recent prior month in which the
          employee performed services in respect of the employer, and
          (b) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in
          relation to the services performed by the employee in
          respect of the employer during that most recent prior
          month.
     (5) If no services were performed by an employee in respect of an
     employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable to or in
     relation to the employee or in any prior month--
          (a) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in
          relation to services performed by the employee in the month
          in which the wages are paid or payable, and
          (b) the services are taken to have been performed at a
          place or places where it may be reasonably expected that
          the services of the employee in respect of the employer
          will be performed.
     (6) All amounts of wages paid or payable in the same month by the
     same employer in respect of the same employee are to be aggregated
     for the purposes of determining whether they are taxable in this
     jurisdiction (as if they were paid or payable for all services
     performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or
     payable, or the most recent prior month, as the case requires).
          Note : For example, if one amount of wages is paid by an
          employer in a particular month for services performed in
          this jurisdiction, and another amount of wages is paid by
          the same employer in the same month for services performed
          by the same employee in another Australian jurisdiction,
          the wages paid are to be aggregated (as if they were paid
          for all services performed by the employee in that month).
          Accordingly, subsection (1) (b) would be applied for the
          purpose of determining whether the wages are taxable in
          this jurisdiction.
     (7) If wages are paid in a different month from the month in which
     they are payable, the question of whether the wages are taxable in
     this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference to the earlier of
     the relevant months.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 11A
Jurisdiction in which employee is based
 
 
11A Jurisdiction in which employee is based
     (1) For the purposes of this Act, the jurisdiction in which an
     employee is based is the jurisdiction in which the employee's
     principal place of residence is located.
     (2) The jurisdiction in which an employee is based is to be
     determined by reference to the state of affairs existing during the
     month in which the relevant wages are paid or payable.
     (3) If more than one jurisdiction would qualify as the jurisdiction
     in which an employee is based during a month, the jurisdiction in
     which the employee is based is to be determined by reference to the
     state of affairs existing on the last day of that month.
     (4) An employee who does not have a principal place of residence is
     taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be an employee who is not
     based in an Australian jurisdiction.
     (5) In the case of wages paid or payable to a corporate employee, the
     jurisdiction in which the employee is based is to be determined in
     accordance with section 11B instead of this section (as if a
     reference in section 11B to an employer were a reference to an
     employee).
     (6) In this section, a
     "corporate employee" is a company that is taken to be an employee
     under section 34 or 39 or a company to whom a payment is made that is
     taken to be wages payable to an employee under section 42 or 47.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 11B
Jurisdiction in which employer is based
 
 
11B Jurisdiction in which employer is based
     (1) For the purposes of this Act, the jurisdiction in which an
     employer is based is--
          (a) the jurisdiction in which the employer's registered
          business address is located (if the employer has an ABN),
          or
          (b) the jurisdiction in which the employer's principal
          place of business is located (in any other case).
     (2) If wages are paid or payable in connection with a business
     carried on by an employer under a trust, the employer's registered
     business address is the registered business address of the trust or,
     if the trust does not have an ABN, the registered business address of
     the trustee of the trust.
     (3) If an employer has registered business addresses located in
     different jurisdictions at the same point in time, the jurisdiction
     in which the employer is based at that point in time is the
     jurisdiction in which the employer's principal place of business is
     located.
     (4) The jurisdiction in which an employer is based is to be
     determined by reference to the state of affairs existing during the
     month in which the relevant wages are paid or payable.
     (5) If more than one jurisdiction would qualify as the jurisdiction
     in which an employer is based during a month, the jurisdiction in
     which the employer is based is to be determined by reference to the
     state of affairs existing on the last day of that month.
     (6) An employer who has neither a registered business address nor a
     principal place of business is taken, for the purposes of this Act,
     to be an employer who is not based in an Australian jurisdiction.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 11C
Place and date of payment of wages
 
 
11C Place and date of payment of wages
     (1) For the purposes of this Act, wages are taken to have been paid
     at a place if, for the purpose of the payment of those wages--
          (a) an instrument is sent or given or an amount is
          transferred by an employer to a person or a person's agent
          at that place, or
          (b) an instruction is given by an employer for the
          crediting of an amount to the account of a person or a
          person's agent at that place.
     (2) The wages are taken to have been paid on the date that the
     instrument was sent or given, the amount was transferred or the
     account credited in accordance with the instruction (as the case
     requires).
     (3) Wages are taken to be payable at the place at which they are
     paid, subject to this section.
     (4) Wages that are not paid by the end of the month in which they are
     payable are taken to be payable at--
          (a) the place where wages were last paid by the employer to
          the employee, or
          (b) if wages have not previously been paid by the employer
          to the employee--the place where the employee last
          performed services in respect of the employer before the
          wages became payable.
     (5) If wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer
     in respect of the same employee are paid or payable in more than one
     Australian jurisdiction, the wages paid or payable in that month are
     taken to be paid or payable in the Australian jurisdiction in which
     the highest proportion of the wages are paid or payable.
     Note : Section 11 requires all wages paid or payable in the same
     month by the same employer in respect of the same employee to be
     aggregated for the purpose of determining whether the wages are
     taxable in this jurisdiction. The above provision ensures only one
     Australian jurisdiction can be considered to be the jurisdiction in
     which the wages are paid or payable.

Payroll tax paid under corresponding applied law
 
 
12 Payroll tax paid under corresponding applied law
     (1) For the purposes of ascertaining the payroll tax payable under
     this Act by an employer who during a return period pays taxable wages
     and Commonwealth place wages, there is to be deducted from the amount
     of payroll tax payable by the employer under this Act the amount of
     payroll tax payable by the employer under the corresponding applied
     law.
     (2) In this section--

     "Commonwealth Act" means the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Act
     1998 of the Commonwealth.

     "Commonwealth place wages" means wages that would be taxable wages
     within the meaning of the corresponding applied law if the
     corresponding applied law applied in relation to each place in this
     jurisdiction that is a Commonwealth place.

     "corresponding applied law" means the provisions of the Payroll Tax
     Act 2007 that would apply in relation to each place in this
     jurisdiction that is a Commonwealth place, pursuant to section 6 (2)
     of the Commonwealth Act, if those provisions were
     "excluded provisions" within the meaning of section 6 (1) of the
     Commonwealth Act.

          otherwise, and
          (b) whether paid or payable in cash or in kind.
     (3) This Act applies in respect of wages referred to in subsection

Value of wages comprising fringe benefits
 
 
15 Value of wages comprising fringe benefits
     (1) For the purposes of this Act, the value of wages comprising a
     fringe benefit is to be determined in accordance with the formula--
          [graphic]

          "TV" is the value that would be the taxable value of the
          benefit as a fringe benefit for the purposes of the FBTA
          Act.

          "FBT rate" is the rate of fringe benefits tax imposed by

          under this Act arises.
     (2) In this Act, a reference to taxable wages that were paid or
     payable by an employer during a month is, in relation to taxable
     wages comprising fringe benefits--
          (a) a reference to the value of the fringe benefits paid or
          payable by the employer during the month, or
          (b) if an election by the employer is in force under
          section 16, a reference to an amount calculated in
          accordance with that section.
     (3) In this Act, a reference to taxable wages that were paid or
     payable by an employer during a year is, in relation to taxable wages
     comprising fringe benefits, a reference to an amount calculated by
     adding together the amounts under subsection (2) (a) or (b) (or
     subsection (2) (a) and (b)) as the case requires, for the months of
     that year.

Employer election regarding taxable value of fringe benefits
 
 
16 Employer election regarding taxable value of fringe benefits
     (1) An employer who has paid or is liable to pay fringe benefits tax
     imposed by the FBTA Act in respect of a period of not less than 15
     months before 30 June in any year may elect to include as the value
     of the fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer during the
     month concerned--
          (a) in a return lodged in relation to each of the first 11
          months occurring after 30 June in that year--1/12 of the
          amount determined in accordance with subsection (2) or that
          part of that amount as, in accordance with section 10,
          comprises taxable wages for the year of tax (within the
          meaning of the FBTA Act) ending on 31 March preceding the
          commencement of the current financial year, and
          (b) in the return lodged in relation to the 12th month--the
          amount determined in accordance with subsection (2) or that
          part of that amount as, in accordance with section 10,
          comprises taxable wages for the year of tax (within the
          meaning of the FBTA Act) ending on 31 March preceding that
          month, less the total of the amounts of fringe benefits
          included in the returns for each of the preceding 11
          months.
     (2) The amount determined in accordance with this subsection is to be
     determined in accordance with the formula--
          [graphic]

          "AFBA" is the aggregate fringe benefits amount within the
          meaning of section 136 of the FBTA Act.

          "FBT rate" is the rate of fringe benefits tax imposed by
          the FBTA Act that applies when the liability to payroll tax
          under this Act arises.
     (3) An election under subsection (1) takes effect when it is notified
     to the Chief Commissioner in the form approved by the Chief
     Commissioner.
     (4) After an employer has made an election under subsection (1), the
     employer must lodge returns containing amounts calculated in
     accordance with the election unless the Chief Commissioner approves,
     by notice in writing given to the employer, the termination of the
     election and allows the employer to include the value referred to in
     section 15 (2) (a).
     (5) If an employer ceases to be liable to pay payroll tax, the value
     of taxable wages comprising fringe benefits to be included in the
     employer's final return is (irrespective of whether or not the
     employer has made an election under subsection (1)) the value of the
     fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer for the period
     commencing on and including the preceding 1 July until the date on
     which the employer ceases to be liable to payroll tax, less the value
     of the fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer during that
     period on which payroll tax has been paid.

Wages include superannuation contributions
 
 
17 Wages include superannuation contributions
     (1) For the purposes of this Act,
     "wages" include a superannuation contribution.
     (2) A
     "superannuation contribution" is a contribution paid or payable by an
     employer in respect of an employee--
          (a) to or as a superannuation fund within the meaning of
          the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 of the
          Commonwealth, or
          (b) as a superannuation guarantee charge within the meaning
          of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992
          of the Commonwealth, or
          (c) to or as any other form of superannuation, provident or
          retirement fund or scheme including--
               (i) the Superannuation Holding Accounts Special
               Account within the meaning of the Small
               Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 of the
               Commonwealth, and
               (ii) a retirement savings account within the
               meaning of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act
               1997 of the Commonwealth, and
               (iii) a wholly or partly unfunded fund or scheme.
     (3) Setting aside any money or anything that is worth money as, or as
     part of, a superannuation fund, superannuation guarantee charge or
     any other form of superannuation, provident or retirement fund or
     scheme is taken to be paying a superannuation contribution.
     (4) Making a superannuation contribution of anything that is worth
     money is taken to be paying a superannuation contribution of the
     amount equal to its value, and its value is to be worked out in
     accordance with section 43 as if that section referred to the
     contribution instead of to wages.
     (5) A superannuation, provident or retirement fund or scheme is
     unfunded to the extent that money paid or payable by an employer in
     respect of an employee covered by the fund or scheme is not paid or
     payable during the employee's period of service with the employer.
     (6) In this section--

     "employee" includes any person to whom, by virtue of a paragraph of
     the definition of
     "wages" in section 13 (1), an amount paid or payable in the
     circumstances referred to in that paragraph constitutes wages.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 18
Inclusion of grant of shares and options as wages
 
 
18 Inclusion of grant of shares and options as wages
     (1) For the purposes of this Act,
     "wages" include the grant of a share or an option to an employee by
     an employer in respect of services performed by the employee if the
     share or option is an ESS interest (within the meaning of section
     83A-10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 of the Commonwealth) and
     is granted to the employee under an employee share scheme (within the
     meaning of that section).
          Note : A grant of a share or an option to an employee by an
          employer that is not an ESS interest will be taxable as a
          fringe benefit under Division 2 of this Part.
     (2) Any such wages are taken, for the purpose of the imposition of
     payroll tax, to be paid or payable on the relevant day.
     (3) For the purposes of this Division, the
     "relevant day" is the day that the employer elects in accordance with
     this Division to treat as the day on which the wages are paid or
     payable.
     (4) To avoid doubt, the grant of a share or option is valuable
     consideration for the purposes of section 46.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 19
Choice of relevant day
 
 
19 Choice of relevant day
     (1) The employer can elect to treat as the
     "relevant day" either the date on which the share or option is
     granted to the employee or the vesting date.
     (2) A share or option is
     "granted" to a person if--
          (a) another person transfers the share or option to that
          person (other than, in the case of a share, by issuing the
          share to that person), or
          (b) in the case of a share--another person allots the share
          to that person, or
          (c) in the case of an option--another person confers the
          option on, or otherwise creates the option in, that person,
          or
          (d) the person otherwise acquires a legal interest in the
          share or option from another person, or
          (e) the person acquires a beneficial interest in the share
          or option from another person.
     (2A) To avoid doubt, if an employee acquires a right to be granted a
     share or an option, or some other material benefit, at the election
     of the employer, the share or option is not granted until the
     employer elects to grant the share or option.
     (3) The
     "vesting date" in respect of a share is one of the following dates
     (whichever happens first)--
          (a) the date on which the share vests in the employee (that
          is, when any conditions applying to the grant of the share
          have been met and the employee's legal or beneficial
          interest in the share cannot be rescinded),
          (b) the date at the end of the period of 7 years from the
          date on which the share is granted to the employee.
     (4) The
     "vesting date" in respect of an option is one of the following dates
     (whichever happens first)--
          (a) the date on which the share to which the option relates
          is granted to the employee,
          (b) the date on which the employee exercises a right under
          the option to have the share the subject of the option
          transferred to, allotted to or vested in him or her,
          (c) the date at the end of the period of 7 years from the
          date on which the option is granted to the employee.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 20
Deemed choice of relevant day in special cases
 
 
20 Deemed choice of relevant day in special cases
     (1) If an employer grants a share or an option to an employee and the
     value of the grant of the share or option is not included in the
     taxable wages of the employer for the financial year in which the
     share or option was granted, the employer is taken to have elected to
     treat the wages constituted by the grant of that share or option as
     being paid or payable on the vesting date.
     (2) If an employer grants a share or an option to an employee and the
     value of the grant of the share or option is nil or, if the employer
     were to elect to treat the date of grant as the relevant day, the
     wages constituted by the grant would not be liable to payroll tax,
     the employer is taken to have elected to treat the wages constituted
     by the grant of that share or option as being paid or payable on the
     date on which the share or option was granted.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 21
Effect of rescission, cancellation of share or option
 
 
21 Effect of rescission, cancellation of share or option
     (1) If the grant of a share or option is withdrawn, cancelled or
     exchanged before the vesting date for any valuable consideration
     (other than the grant of other shares or options), the following
     provisions apply--
          (a) the date of withdrawal, cancellation or exchange is
          taken to be the vesting date of the share or option,
          (b) the market value of the share or option, on the vesting
          date, is taken to be the amount of the valuable
          consideration (and, accordingly, that amount is the amount
          paid or payable as wages on that date).
     (2) If an employer includes the value of a grant of a share or option
     in the taxable wages of the employer for a financial year and the
     grant is rescinded because the conditions attaching to the grant were
     not met, the taxable wages of the employer, in the financial year in
     which the grant is rescinded, are to be reduced by the value of the
     grant as previously included in the taxable wages of the employer.
     (3) Subsection (2) does not apply just because an employee fails to
     exercise an option or to otherwise exercise his or her rights in
     respect of a share or option.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 22
Grant of share pursuant to exercise of option
 
 
22 Grant of share pursuant to exercise of option
The grant of the share by an employer does not constitute wages for the
purposes of this Act if the employer is required to grant the share as a
consequence of the exercise of an option by a person and--
     (a) the grant of the option to the person constitutes wages for the
     purposes of this Act, or
     (b) the option was granted to the person before 1 July 2003.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 23
Value of shares and options
 
 
23 Value of shares and options
     (1) If the grant of a share or option constitutes wages under this
     Division, the amount paid or payable as wages is taken, for the
     purposes of this Act, to be the value of the share or option
     (expressed in Australian currency) on the relevant day, less the
     consideration (if any) paid or given by the employee in respect of
     the share or option (other than consideration in the form of services
     performed).
     (2) The value of a share or an option is--
          (a) the market value, or
          (b) the amount determined as provided for by the
          Commonwealth income tax provisions.
     (3) The employer may elect the method by which the value of a share
     or an option is determined in any return lodged under this Act.
     (4) However, the Chief Commissioner may determine the method by which
     the value of a share or an option is determined if the grant of the
     share or option is not included as wages in a return lodged by an
     employer as required by this Act.
     (5) In determining the market value of a share or option, anything
     that would prevent or restrict conversion of the share or option to
     money is to be disregarded.
     (6) The Commonwealth income tax provisions apply with the following
     modifications, and any other necessary modifications--
          (a) the value of an option is to be determined as if it
          were a right to acquire a beneficial interest in a share,
          (b) a reference to the acquisition of a beneficial interest
          in a share or right is to be read as a reference to the
          grant of a share or an option.
     (7) In this section,
     "Commonwealth income tax provisions" means section 83A-315 of the
     Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 of the Commonwealth and the
     regulations made for the purposes of that section.
          Note : See Division 83A of the Income Tax Assessment (1997
          Act) Regulations 2021 of the Commonwealth for the relevant
          regulations.

Inclusion of shares and options granted to directors as wages
 
 
24 Inclusion of shares and options granted to directors as wages
     (1) For the purposes of this Act,
     "wages" include the grant of a share or an option by a company to a
     director of the company who is not an employee of the company by way
     of remuneration for the appointment or services of the director.
     (2) For that purpose, the other provisions of this Division apply in
     respect of any such grant as if a reference to the employer were a
     reference to the company and a reference to the employee were a
     reference to the director of the company.
     (3) In this section, a reference to a director of the company
     includes a reference to the following--
          (a) a person who, under a contract or other arrangement, is
          to be appointed as a director of the company,
          (b) a former director of the company.
     (4) However, if wages referred to in this section are fringe
     benefits, the value of the wages is to be determined in accordance
     with Division 2 of this Part (and not this Division).
     Note : Section 13 provides that a reference to an employee in this
     Act includes a reference to any person to whom any amount that is
     treated as wages under this Act is paid or payable. See also section
     11, which deems the wages to be paid or payable for services
     performed.

26 Place where wages are payable
     (1) The wages constituted by the grant of the share or option are
     taken to be paid or payable in this jurisdiction if the share is a
     share in a local company or, in the case of an option, an option to
     acquire shares in a local company.
     (2) In any other case, the wages constituted by the grant of the
     share or option are taken to be paid or payable outside this
     jurisdiction.
          Note : The place where wages are paid or payable is
          sometimes relevant to determining whether the wages are
          liable to payroll tax under this Act. See section 11.

     "local company" means--
          (a) a company incorporated or taken to be incorporated

     component of a motor vehicle allowance paid or payable in respect of
     that year.
     (2) Accordingly, if the total motor vehicle allowance paid or payable

     (2) However, a

          of that person, or
          (b) is supplied with services for or in relation to the
          performance of work where--
               (i) those services are of a kind not ordinarily
               required by the designated person and are
               performed by a person who ordinarily performs
               services of that kind to the public generally, or
               (ii) those services are of a kind ordinarily
               required by the designated person for less than

               financial year and are not services--
                    (A) provided by a person by whom
                    similar services are provided to the
                    designated person, or
                    (B) for or in relation to the
                    performance of work where any of the
                    persons who perform the work also
                    perform similar work for the designated
                    person,
               for periods that, in the aggregate, exceed 90
               days in that financial year, or
               (iv) those services are supplied under a contract
               to which subparagraphs (i)-(iii) do not apply and
               the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that those
               services are performed by a person who ordinarily

               generally in that financial year, or
          (c) is supplied by a person (the

          services relate is performed--
               (i) by two or more persons employed by, or who
               provide services for, the contractor in the
               course of a business carried on by the

               (ii) where the contractor is a partnership of two
               or more natural persons, by one or more of the
               members of the partnership and one or more
               persons employed by, or who provide services for,
               the contractor in the course of a business
               carried on by the contractor, or
               (iii) where the contractor is a natural person,
               by the contractor and one or more persons
               employed by, or who provide services for, the
               contractor in the course of a business carried on

          (d) is supplied with services solely for or ancillary to
          the conveyance of goods by means of a vehicle provided by
          the person conveying them.
     (2A) Subsection (2) does not apply if the Chief Commissioner
     determines that the contract or arrangement under which the services
     are supplied was entered into with an intention either directly or
     indirectly of avoiding or evading the payment of tax by any person.
     (2B) Subsection (2) (a), (b), (c) or (d) does not apply to a contract

     wages, but only to the extent of the difference between--

          section (a
          "Jobs Plus agreement"), and
          (b) to give effect to the agreement.
     (1A) To avoid doubt, a variation, agreed on or after 1 July 2024, of
     a Jobs Plus agreement entered into before that date must not be
     regarded as the entry into a new Jobs Plus agreement, unless the
     variation results in an increase in the number of positions that are
     entitled to a wages exemption under this section.
     (2) Without limiting the matters that may be specified by a Jobs Plus
     agreement, the agreement must specify--
          (a) the kinds of wages that are exempt wages under this
          section, and
          (b) the grounds on which, or the circumstances in which,
          the relevant Minister may revoke an exemption under this
          section, and
          (c) for an agreement with an employer whose registered
          business address is outside the metropolitan area--that the
          exemption cannot be revoked merely because the employer has
          only created between 20 and 29 new jobs (inclusive).
     (3) Subject to this section, wages are exempt wages if--
          (a) they are paid or payable by an employer who enters into

               (ii) within the first 4 years of the exemption
               applying to wages for the person's position, and
          (b) they are wages of a kind that is specified by the
          agreement to be exempt wages under this section.
     (4) The relevant Minister may, by written notice issued to an
     employer who enters into a Jobs Plus agreement, revoke the exemption
     under this section on the grounds, or in the circumstances, specified

     (5) The effect of the revocation is as follows--
          (a) the wages referred to in subsection (3) are taken never
          to have been exempt wages under this section,
          (b) the employer is liable to pay payroll tax on the wages
          even if the relevant Minister revokes the exemption under
          this section after the employer relies on the exemption as
          the reason for not paying payroll tax on the wages,
          (c) the Chief Commissioner must assess or reassess the
          employer's liability to pay payroll tax on the wages
          accordingly.
     (6) For the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1996, section
     9(3)(c), the Chief Commissioner is authorised to make a reassessment
     under this section until 1 July 2033.
     (7) An employer who enters into a Jobs Plus agreement cannot lodge an
     objection with the Chief Commissioner under the Taxation
     Administration Act 1996, Part 10, Division 1 to an assessment or
     reassessment under this section on the grounds that the relevant
     Minister has revoked an exemption under this section.
     (8) Without limiting the Taxation Administration Act 1996, section 82
     (b)(i), a Jobs Plus administrator may disclose to another Jobs Plus
     administrator information in relation to a Jobs Plus agreement,
     including personal information within the meaning of the Privacy and
     Personal Information Protection Act 1998 and confidential
     information--
          (a) to assist a Jobs Plus administrator to exercise a
          function under this section, including to assist the
          relevant Minister to give effect to the agreement, or
          (b) in connection with the administration of a taxation
          law.
     (9) The relevant Minister may delegate a function of the relevant
     Minister under this section to another Jobs Plus administrator,
     subject to the following--
          (a) the relevant Minister cannot delegate a function to a
          tax officer,
          (b) the relevant Minister cannot delegate a function under
          subsection (1)(a) or (4) to any person other than the Chief
          Executive Officer of Investment NSW,
          (c) the relevant Minister cannot delegate this power of
          delegation.
     (10) The State, or a Jobs Plus administrator, does not incur civil
     liability in connection with the exercise of a function under this
     section.
     (11) The relevant Minister must, until 1 July 2029, cause to be
     tabled in each House of Parliament an annual report containing the
     following for each financial year--
          (a) the total number of employers who entered into Jobs
          Plus agreements,
          (b) the total number of new jobs the employers agreed to
          create, as specified by the agreements,
          (c) the total number of new jobs in fact created by the
          employers, whether created in that financial year or an
          earlier financial year,
          (d) the total amount of payroll tax from which the
          employers were exempt under this section, whether in
          relation to that financial year or an earlier financial
          year.
     (11A) To avoid doubt, this section prevails over the provisions of a
     Jobs Plus agreement to the extent of an inconsistency.
     (11B) This section is repealed on 2 July 2033.
     (12) In this section--

74A Groups arising from former entities
     (1) An entity (the

     informal, or might reasonably be expected, to act in accordance with
     the directions, instructions or wishes of the third party.
     (3) Subsection (2) applies whether the directions, instructions or
     wishes are, or might reasonably be expected to be, communicated

Direct interest
 
 
76 Direct interest
     (1) An entity has a
     "direct interest" in a corporation if--
          (a) in the case of an entity that is a person--the person
          can, directly or indirectly, exercise, control the exercise
          of, or substantially influence the exercise of, the voting
          power attached to any voting shares issued by the
          corporation, or
          (b) in the case of an entity that is 2 or more persons who
          are associated persons--each of the associated persons can,
          directly or indirectly, exercise, control the exercise of,
          or substantially influence the exercise of, the voting
          power attached to any voting shares issued by the

     (2) The value of the direct interest of the entity in the corporation
     is the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of the voting power of
     all voting shares issued by the corporation that--
          (a) in the case of an entity that is a person--the person

          of, or substantially influence the exercise of, as referred
          to in subsection (1), or
          (b) in the case of an entity that is 2 or more persons who

Indirect interest
 
 
77 Indirect interest
     (1) An entity has an
     "indirect interest" in a corporation if the corporation is linked to
     another corporation (the
     "directly controlled corporation") in which the entity has a direct
     interest.
     (2) A corporation is linked to a directly controlled corporation if
     the corporation is part of a chain of corporations--
          (a) that starts with the directly controlled corporation,
          and
          (b) in which a link in the chain is formed if a corporation
          has a direct interest in the next corporation in the chain.
     (3) The following are examples of how subsections (1) and (2) work
     (the examples are cumulative)--
          (a) corporation A (a directly controlled corporation) has a
          direct interest in corporation B. Corporations A and B form
          part of a chain of corporations, and corporation B is
          linked to corporation A. Accordingly, an entity that has a
          direct interest in corporation A also has an indirect
          interest in corporation B,
          (b) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation
          C. In this case, corporations A, B and C form part of a
          chain of corporations. Both corporations B and C are linked
          to corporation A. The entity that has a direct interest in
          corporation A has an indirect interest in both corporations
          B and C,
          (c) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation
          D. There are now 2 chains of corporations, one consisting
          of A, B and C, and one consisting of A, B and D.
          Corporations B, C and D are all linked to corporation A and
          an entity that has a direct interest in corporation A would
          have an indirect interest in corporations B, C and D. An
          entity that has a direct interest in corporation B would
          have an indirect interest in corporations C and D. However,
          an entity that has a direct interest in corporation C only
          would not have an indirect interest in corporation D, as
          corporation D is not linked to corporation C.
     (4) The value of the indirect interest of an entity in a corporation
     (an
     "indirectly controlled corporation") that is linked to a directly
     controlled corporation is calculated by multiplying together the
     following--
          (a) the value of the direct interest of the entity in the
          directly controlled corporation,
          (b) the value of each direct interest that forms a link in
          the chain of corporations by which the indirectly
          controlled corporation is linked to the directly controlled
          corporation.
     (5) The following are examples of how subsection (4) works (the
     examples are cumulative)--
          (a) an entity has a direct interest (with a value of 80%)
          in corporation A. Corporation A has a direct interest (with
          a value of 70%) in corporation B. The value of the indirect
          interest of the entity in corporation B is 80% × 70% (that
          is, 56%). Accordingly, in this example the entity has a
          controlling interest (within the meaning of section 73
          (Groups arising from tracing of interests in corporations))
          in corporation B,
          (b) corporation B also has a direct interest (with a value
          of 40%) in corporation C. The value of the indirect
          interest of the entity in corporation C is 80% × 70% × 40%
          (that is, 22.4%). Accordingly, in this example the entity
          does not have a controlling interest in corporation C.
     (6) It is possible for an entity to have more than one indirect
     interest in a corporation. This may occur if the corporation is
     linked to more than one corporation in which the entity has a direct
     interest, or if the corporation is linked to only one corporation in
     which the entity has a direct interest but is linked through more
     than one chain of corporations. In that case, the entity has an
     aggregate interest in the corporation (see section 78 (Aggregation of
     interests)).
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 78
Aggregation of interests
 
 
78 Aggregation of interests
     (1) An entity has an
     "aggregate interest" in a corporation if--
          (a) the entity has a direct interest and one or more
          indirect interests in the corporation, or
          (b) the entity has more than one indirect interest in the
          corporation.
     (2) The value of the aggregate interest of an entity in a corporation
     is the sum of the following--
          (a) the value of the direct interest (if any) of the entity
          in the corporation,
          (b) the value of each indirect interest of the entity in
          the corporation.
     (3) For example--
          (a) an entity has a direct interest (with a value of 40%)
          in corporation B,
          (b) the entity also has a direct interest (with a value of
          25%) in corporation A, which in turn has a direct interest
          (with a value of 60%) in corporation B. Accordingly, the
          entity also has an indirect interest in corporation B with
          a value of 15% (that is, 25% × 60%),
          (c) the value of the entity's aggregate interest in
          corporation B is the sum of the direct interest (40%) and
          the indirect interest (15%), which is 55%,
          (d) accordingly, in this example, the entity has a
          controlling interest in corporation B (within the meaning
          of section 73 (Groups arising from tracing of interests in
          corporations)).

79 Exclusion of persons from groups
     (1) The Chief Commissioner may, by order in writing, determine that a
     person who would, but for the determination, be a member of a group
     is not a member of the group.
     (2) The Chief Commissioner may only make such a determination if
     satisfied, having regard to the nature and degree of ownership and
     control of the businesses, the nature of the businesses and any other
     matters the Chief Commissioner considers relevant, that a business
     carried on by the person, is carried on independently of, and is not
     connected with the carrying on of, a business carried on by any other
     member of that group.
     (3) The Chief Commissioner cannot exclude a person from a group if
     the person is a body corporate that, by reason of section 50 of the
     Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth, is related to another body
     corporate that is a member of that group.

     74 (Smaller groups subsumed by larger groups).
     (5) A determination can be expressed to take effect on a date that is
     earlier than the date of the determination.
     (6) The Chief Commissioner may by order in writing revoke a
     determination that applies in respect of a person if satisfied that
     the circumstances in which a determination may be made do not apply
     to the person.

82 Determination of correct amount of payroll tax
     (1) For the purposes of this Part, the
     "correct amount of payroll tax" payable by an employer in respect of
     a financial year is the amount determined in accordance with Schedule
     1 in respect of that financial year.
     (2) This Part applies in respect of payroll tax paid or payable
     whether as a group employer or as an individual employer.
     (3) If an employer is liable for payroll tax both as an individual
     employer and as a group employer (for different periods in the same
     financial year) separate adjustments are to be made under this Part
     in respect of any period as a group employer and any period as an
     individual employer (and for that purpose separate determinations of
     the correct amount of payroll tax payable by the employer are to be
     made).
     (4) In this Part--

     "group employer" means an employer who is a member of a group.

     "individual employer" means an employer who is not a member of a

Annual adjustment of payroll tax
 
 
83 Annual adjustment of payroll tax
     (1) If the amount of payroll tax paid or payable by an employer when
     the employer made the returns relating to a financial year is greater
     than the correct amount of payroll tax payable by the employer in
     respect of the financial year, the Chief Commissioner (on application
     by the employer) is to refund to that employer an amount equal to the
     difference.
     (2) If the amount of payroll tax paid or payable by an employer when
     the employer made the returns relating to a financial year is less
     than the correct amount of payroll tax payable by the employer in
     respect of the financial year, the employer must pay to the Chief
     Commissioner as payroll tax an amount equal to the difference.
     (3) Any amount payable by an employer under this section in respect
     of a financial year must be paid within the period during which the
     employer is required to lodge a return under this Act in respect of
     the return period that is or includes the month of June in that
     financial year.
     (4) The amount of any refund payable to an employer in respect of a
     financial year under this section is to be reduced by the amount of
     any other refund of payroll tax made in respect of that financial
     year to that employer (whether under this section or otherwise)
     before the time of the refund under this section.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 84
Adjustment of payroll tax when employer changes circumstances
 
 
84 Adjustment of payroll tax when employer changes circumstances
     (1) If an employer changes their circumstances during a financial
     year, the employer must, if the amount of payroll tax paid or payable
     by the employer when the employer made returns relating to the
     relevant period prior to the change of circumstances is less than the
     correct amount of payroll tax payable by the employer in respect of
     the financial year, pay to the Chief Commissioner as payroll tax an
     amount equal to the difference.
     (2) A
     "change of circumstances" occurs when the employer--
          (a) ceases to pay or be liable to pay taxable wages and
          interstate wages, or
          (b) becomes a group employer (following a period as an
          individual employer), or
          (c) ceases to be a group employer (and becomes an
          individual employer).
     (3) The
     "relevant period" prior to a change of circumstances is the period
     prior to the change (during the financial year concerned and since
     any prior change of circumstances) for which the employer paid or was
     liable to pay taxable wages or interstate wages.
     (4) In calculating for the purposes of this section the correct
     amount of payroll tax payable by the employer, it is to be assumed
     that the wages paid or payable by the employer during the relevant
     period are the only wages paid or payable by the employer during the
     financial year concerned.
     (5) Any amount payable by an employer under this section in respect
     of a relevant period must be paid within the period during which the
     employer is required to lodge a return under this Act relating to
     that relevant period or the last return under this Act relating to
     the relevant period.
     (6) Any payroll tax paid or payable by an employer under this section
     is to be included as payroll tax paid or payable by the employer for
     the purposes of the annual adjustment of payroll tax under this Part.
     Note : If an employer ceases to be a group employer during a
     financial year an adjustment will be made under this section. If
     later in that financial year the employer ceases to pay wages there
     will be a further adjustment under this section. The first adjustment
     will adjust payroll tax paid for the period as a group employer
     against the correct amount of tax that should have been paid (based
     on the assumption that the period as a group employer is the only
     period for which the employer paid wages throughout the year). The
     second adjustment will adjust payroll tax paid for the period as an
     individual employer against the correct amount of tax that should
     have been paid (based on the assumption that the period as an
     individual employer is the only period for which the employer paid
     wages throughout the year). Any amount of payroll tax paid under this
     section is taken into account for the purposes of the annual
     adjustment of payroll tax.
 

PAYROLL TAX ACT 2007
- SECT 85
Special provision where wages fluctuate
 
 
85 Special provision where wages fluctuate
If a person who did not pay and was not liable to pay taxable wages or
interstate wages for any part of a financial year satisfies the Chief
Commissioner that, by reason of the nature of the person's trade or business,
the taxable wages and interstate wages, if any, paid or payable by the person
fluctuate with different periods of the financial year, the Chief Commissioner
may determine that the person is to be treated for the purposes of this Part--
     (a) if the person has conducted that trade or business in Australia
     during the whole of the financial year--as an employer who pays or is
     liable to pay taxable wages throughout the financial year, or
     (b) if the person has conducted that trade or business in Australia
     during part only of the financial year--as an employer who pays or is
     liable to pay taxable wages throughout that last-mentioned part of
     the financial year.
     Note : The effect of such a determination is that when the correct
     amount of payroll tax is calculated (for the purposes of a tax
     adjustment provided for by this Part) the employer may receive the
     benefit of the payroll tax threshold for the period for which the
     employer is to be treated as paying wages, and not just for the
     period for which the employer actually pays wages. Without such a
     determination, an employer may only receive the benefit of a
     proportion of the threshold amount that is equivalent to the
     proportion of the whole financial year for which the employer
     actually pays wages.

          is liable to pay, anywhere, wages of more than the weekly
          threshold amount per week that are wholly or partly taxable
          wages, or
          (b) the employer is a member of a group the members of
          which together during a month in a financial year pay or
          are liable to pay, anywhere, wages of more than the weekly
          threshold amount per week that are wholly or partly taxable
          wages,
     with the
     "weekly threshold amount" calculated in accordance with the following
     formula (disregarding any amount in cents)--

          "N" is the number of days in the financial year.

          "TA" is the threshold amount for the financial year as
          provided by Schedule 1.
     (2) The application for registration is to be made to the Chief
     Commissioner in a form and manner approved by the Chief Commissioner
     within 7 days after the end of the month concerned.
     (3) The Chief Commissioner is to register the applicant as an
     employer under this Act.
     (4) The Chief Commissioner may cancel the registration of a person as
     an employer if satisfied that the person has ceased to pay or to have
     a liability to pay wages as described in subsection (1).
     (5) If the Chief Commissioner cancels the registration of a person as
     an employer in any financial year and that person subsequently pays
     or is liable to pay taxable wages during that financial year the
     person may, despite the fact that the person is not required to apply
     for registration, apply to the Chief Commissioner (in a form and
     manner approved by the Chief Commissioner) for registration as an
     employer, and the Chief Commissioner is then to register the person
     as an employer under this Act.

     paragraph (a).
14 Averaging method
     (1) If an employer selects the averaging method for the purposes of
     determining the number of business kilometres travelled during the
     financial year, the following details are required to be recorded by
     the employer--
          (a) the odometer readings at the beginning and end of each
          business journey undertaken by the person during the
          relevant 12-week period by means of a motor vehicle
          provided or maintained by the person,

               period.
          (b) the specific purpose for which each such business
          journey was taken,
          (c) the distance travelled by the person during the
          relevant 12-week period in the course of all such business
          journeys, calculated on the basis of the odometer readings
          referred to in paragraph (a),
          (d) the odometer readings at the beginning and end of the
          relevant 12-week period for each motor vehicle provided or

          business journeys,
          (e) the distance travelled by each such vehicle during the
          relevant 12-week period, calculated on the basis of the
          odometer readings referred to in paragraph (d),
          (f) the distance travelled by the person in the course of
          business journeys undertaken by means of each such vehicle
          during the relevant 12-week period, calculated as a
          percentage of the distance travelled by that vehicle during
          that period (
          "the relevant percentage"),
          (g) the odometer readings at the beginning and end of the

          the person for the purpose of undertaking business

          (i) the distance travelled by the person in the course of
          business journeys undertaken by means of each such vehicle
          during the financial year (which is taken to be the
          "number of business kilometres travelled during the
          financial year"), calculated on the basis that the
          percentage of that distance that was travelled by the
          person in the course of business journeys undertaken by
          means of each such vehicle during the financial year is the
          same as the relevant percentage.
     (2) For the next succeeding 4 financial years after the first
     financial year in which odometer details are recorded in accordance
     with subclause (1), an employer is not required to calculate the
     relevant percentage, or record the details referred to in subclause
     (1) (a)-(f), for the person but is required to record the other
     details referred to in that subclause.
     (3) Accordingly, for the next succeeding 4 financial years after the
     first financial year in which odometer details are recorded in
     accordance with subclause (1), the number of business kilometres
     travelled during the financial year is to be calculated (as referred
     to in subclause (1) (i)) on the basis of the relevant percentage
     calculated for the first financial year.
     (4) Despite subclauses (2) and (3), an employer is required to
     calculate the relevant percentage for a financial year, and record
     the details referred to in subclause (1) (a)-(f), if--
          (a) the Chief Commissioner serves a notice on the employer
          before the commencement of a financial year during that
          period directing the employer to keep the details referred
          to in subclause (1) (a)-(f) for that financial year, or
          (b) the employer wishes to use the recording method
          referred to in this clause for one or more additional motor
          vehicles used by the person in any financial year or for
          any other reason.
     (5) In a situation referred to in subclause (4), the new record for
     the financial year replaces the relevant percentage details
     previously recorded and subclauses (2) and (3) apply in relation to
     the new record for the financial year as if it were the first
     financial year in which odometer details were recorded.
     (6) An employer who has adopted and employed the method of recording
     referred to in subclauses (2) and (3) for a person for 4 successive
     financial years must, in the next succeeding financial year, make a
     fresh recording of all the details specified in subclause (1) if the
     employer intends to continue to use the same method of recording for
     the person. Subclauses (2) and (3) then apply in relation to the new
     record for the financial year as if it were the first financial year
     in which odometer details were recorded.
     (7) If the odometer of a motor vehicle is replaced or recalibrated
     during any period for which its readings are relevant for the
     purposes of this clause, the odometer readings immediately before and
     after the replacement or recalibration are to be recorded.
15 Meaning of relevant 12-week period
     (1) In clause 14,
     "relevant 12-week period" means a continuous period of at least 12
     weeks, selected by the employer, throughout which a motor vehicle is
     provided or maintained by a person. If the motor vehicle is provided
     or maintained for less than 12 weeks, the period must be the entire
     period for which the motor vehicle is provided or maintained.
     (2) The period may overlap the start or end of the financial year, so
     long as it includes part of the year.
     (3) If the averaging method is used for 2 or more motor vehicles for
     the same financial year, the odometer readings for those motor
     vehicles must cover periods that are concurrent.
16 Replacing one motor vehicle with another motor vehicle
     (1) For the purposes of using the averaging method, an employer may
     nominate one motor vehicle as having replaced another motor vehicle
     with effect from a day specified in the nomination.
     (2) After the nomination takes effect, the replacement motor vehicle
     is treated as the original motor vehicle, and the original motor
     vehicle is treated as a different motor vehicle. An employer need not
     repeat for the replacement vehicle the steps already taken for the
     original motor vehicle.
     (3) An employer must record the nomination in writing in the
     financial year in which the nomination takes effect.
     (4) However, the Chief Commissioner may allow an employer to record
     the nomination at a later time.
17 Changing method of recording
     (1) An employer may change from using the averaging method to using
     the continuous recording method with effect from the beginning of a
     financial year if the employer complies with clause 13 in respect of
     the financial year.
     (2) An employer may change from using the continuous recording method
     to using the averaging method with effect from the beginning of a
     financial year if the employer complies with clause 14 in respect of
     the financial year.

Part 2 - Calculation of payroll tax Division 1 - General 2 Calculation by
reference to return period
The amount of payroll tax that an employer is required to pay in relation to a
return of wages in respect of a financial year or a part of a financial year is
a proportion (equivalent to the ratio of the number of days to which the return
relates to the number of days in the financial year) of the payroll tax that
would be payable by the employer for the whole of that year.
3 Amount payable for whole of financial year
For the purposes of this Part, the payroll tax that would be payable by an
employer for the whole of a financial year is to be ascertained on the basis of
the following assumptions--
     (a) the assumption that the employer pays or is liable to pay taxable
     wages for the whole of the financial year,
     (b) the assumption that the total amount of taxable wages paid or
     payable by the employer during the financial year is a multiple
     (equivalent to the ratio of the number of days in the financial year
     to the number of days to which the return relates) of the taxable
     wages paid or payable by the employer during the period to which the
     return relates.

     2013 (except a Staff Agency listed in Schedule 1 to that Act), the
     Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Judicial Commission
     and the NSW Police Force together constitute a group constituted

corporation because of section 72.
Part 5 - Recovery of payroll tax from principal contractors 17 Liability of
principal contractor for payroll tax payable in respect of employees of
subcontractor
     (1) This Part applies if--
          (a) a person (referred to in this Part as the
          "principal contractor") has entered into a contract for the
          carrying out of work by another person (referred to in this
          Part as the
          "subcontractor"), and
          (b) employees of that subcontractor (referred to in this
          Part as the
          "relevant employees") are engaged in carrying out the work,
          and
          (c) the work is carried out in connection with a business
          undertaking of the principal contractor.
     (2) If, at the end of the period of 60 days after the end of a
     financial year, any payroll tax payable by the subcontractor in
     respect of wages paid or payable to the relevant employees during the
     financial year for work done in connection with the contract has not
     been paid, the principal contractor is jointly and severally liable
     with the subcontractor for the payment of the payroll tax.
     (3) Section 45 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 (subsection
     (3) excepted) applies to an amount payable under this clause.
          Note : Section 44 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996
          provides that the amount of tax payable may be recovered by
          the Chief Commissioner as a debt to the Chief Commissioner.
          Section 45 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 provides
          that if parties are jointly and severally liable for the
          payment of an amount under a taxation law, the Chief
          Commissioner may recover the amount payable from any of the
          parties. It also provides for the recovery of interest,
          penalty tax and costs from the parties who are jointly and
          severally liable for the payment of the tax.
18 Written statement relieves principal contractor of liability
     (1) The principal contractor is not liable under this Part for the
     payment of any payroll tax payable in respect of wages paid or
     payable to the relevant employees during a period if the principal
     contractor has been given a written statement by the subcontractor in
     respect of that period.
     (2) The written statement is a statement comprising the following
     statements--
          (a) a statement by the subcontractor that the subcontractor
          is registered as an employer under this Act or is not
          required to be registered under this Act (whichever is
          applicable),
          (b) a statement by the subcontractor that all payroll tax
          payable by the subcontractor in respect of wages paid or
          payable to the relevant employees during any period of the
          contract for work done in connection with the contract has
          been paid,
          (c) a statement by the subcontractor as to whether the
          subcontractor is also a principal contractor in connection
          with that work,
          (d) if the subcontractor is also a principal contractor in
          connection with that work, a statement by the subcontractor
          as to whether the subcontractor has been given a written
          statement under this clause in the capacity of principal
          contractor in connection with that work.
     (3) The written statement may include any statement made by the
     subcontractor for the purposes of section 127 of the Industrial
     Relations Act 1996 or a similar provision under any other Act.
     (4) The written statement is to be in a form approved by the Chief
     Commissioner.
     (5) The subcontractor must keep a record of a written statement given
     to a principal contractor under this clause.
          Note : Section 53 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996
          requires the record to be kept for not less than 5 years
          after it was made.
     (6) The principal contractor may withhold any payment due to the
     subcontractor under the contract until the subcontractor gives a
     written statement under this clause for any period up to the date of
     the statement. Any penalty for late payment under the contract does
     not apply to any payment withheld under this subclause.
     (7) The written statement is not effective to relieve the principal
     contractor of liability under this Part if the principal contractor
     had, when given the statement, reason to believe it was false.
     (8) A subcontractor who gives the principal contractor a written
     statement knowing it to be false is guilty of an offence.
          : Maximum penalty--100 penalty units.
          Note : An offence against subclause (8) committed by a
          corporation is an executive liability offence attracting
          executive liability for a director or other person involved
          in the management of the corporation--see section 121 of
          the Taxation Administration Act 1996.
19 Right of recovery
The principal contractor is entitled to recover from the subcontractor as a
debt in a court of competent jurisdiction any payment made by the principal
contractor as a consequence of a liability arising under this Part.
20 Application of Part
     (1) This Part does not apply in relation to a contract if the
     subcontractor is in receivership or in the course of being wound up
     or, in the case of an individual, is bankrupt and if payments made
     under the contract are made to the receiver, liquidator or trustee in
     bankruptcy.
     (2) To avoid doubt, this Part extends to a principal contractor who
     is the owner or occupier of a building for the carrying out of work
     in connection with the building so long as the building is owned or
     occupied by the principal contractor in connection with a business
     undertaking of the principal contractor.
Part 6 - Miscellaneous 21 Exemption from lodging returns
     (1) If the Chief Commissioner is of the opinion that tax will not be
     payable by an employer, or, if paid, would be refunded, the Chief
     Commissioner may issue a certificate to that employer exempting the
     employer from lodging monthly returns in accordance with section 87
     and any employer to whom such a certificate is issued may refrain
     from lodging monthly returns but must, unless the contrary is
     expressed in the certificate, lodge a return relating to each
     financial year within 28 days after the close of that financial year.
     (2) A certificate issued under this clause may be either
     unconditional or subject to such conditions as are prescribed by the
     regulations or as the Chief Commissioner thinks fit.
     (3) The Chief Commissioner may, at any time, by notice in writing,
     revoke any certificate issued under this clause.
     (4) The issue of a certificate under this clause does not exempt an
     employer from the payment of any payroll tax, despite the fact that
     it may have the effect of postponing the time for payment of any
     payroll tax.

This Schedule applies for the purpose of ascertaining the payroll tax payable
by an employer in relation to a financial year commencing on 1 July 2008, 2009
or 2010.
2 Determination of amount of payroll tax
     (1) The amount that an employer is liable to pay as payroll tax for
     any period is to be determined in accordance with this Schedule.
     (2) The amount of payroll tax that an employer is required to pay in

     determined for that period in accordance with this Schedule.
3 Determination of payroll tax for full financial year
The amount that an employer is liable to pay as payroll tax for a financial
year is to be determined as the sum of the amount that the employer is liable
to pay as payroll tax for the first half of the financial year and the amount
that the employer is liable to pay as payroll tax for the second half of the
financial year, with those amounts determined in accordance with this Schedule.
     Note : This method of adding the payroll tax payable for 2 half-years
     accommodates the financial years commencing on 1 July 2008, 2009 and
     2010, in which the rate that applies in the first half of the year is
     different from the rate that applies in the second half of the year.
4 Definitions
In this Schedule--

"annual threshold amount" means the threshold amount under Schedule 1 for the
financial year of which the relevant period forms part.

"financial year" means a financial year commencing on 1 July 2008, 2009 or
2010.

"half-year" means the first or second half of a financial year (with the first
half comprising the months July to December and the second half comprising the
months January to June).

"N" is the number of days in the relevant period.

"R" has the same value as in Schedule 1 in respect of the relevant period.

"relevant period" means the period to which the calculation of the relevant
payroll tax relates.

"TA" or
"threshold amount" for a relevant period is the amount calculated by
multiplying the annual threshold amount by N/365.
     Note : Clauses 9 and 14 provide that when wages for half a financial
     year are less than the threshold amount for that half-year, the
     unused portion of that threshold amount is to be allocated to the
     other half of the financial year.
Part 2 - Employers who are not members of a group 5 Application of Part
This Part applies only to an employer who is not a member of a group.
6 Definitions

     group (
     "the half-year total") is less than the threshold amount for that
     half-year (
     "the half-year TA"), the difference between the half-year total and
     the half-year TA is to be added to the threshold amount for the other
     half-year of the financial year concerned to arrive at an
     "adjusted TA" for that other half-year.
     (2) When there is an adjusted TA for the second half of a financial
     year, the threshold amount for any relevant period in that second
     half is the amount determined by multiplying the adjusted TA by N/
     181.
     (3) When there is an adjusted TA for the first half of a financial
     year, that adjusted TA is the threshold amount that is to be used to
     determine the amount that the employer is liable to pay as payroll

     (2) When there is an adjusted TA for the second half of a financial
     year, the threshold amount for any relevant period in that second
     half is the amount determined by multiplying the adjusted TA by N/
     181.

     determine the amount that the employer is liable to pay as payroll
     tax for that first half (as part of the determination of the amount
     of payroll tax payable for the full financial year) but is not to be
