             all Australian jurisdictions and are paid or payable  in  this
             jurisdiction.

         Note for subsection (1)(c)

         Section 66A provides an exemption for wages  paid  or  payable  for
         services performed wholly in one or  more  other  countries  for  a
         continuous period of more than 6 months.

      (2)   The question of whether wages are taxable in  this  jurisdiction
         is to be determined by reference only to the services performed  by
         the employee in respect of the employer during the month  in  which
         the wages are paid or payable, subject to this section.

      (3)   Any wages paid or payable  by  an  employer  in  respect  of  an
         employee in a particular month are taken to be paid or payable  for
         or in relation to the services performed by the employee in respect
         of the employer during that month.

         Example for subsections (2) and (3)

         Wages paid to an employee in June 2010 by an employer include wages
         for services performed by the employee wholly in this  jurisdiction
         in that month and a bonus for services performed  by  the  employee
         during the financial year ending at the end  of  June  2010,  which
         were services partly performed in this jurisdiction and  partly  in
         other Australian jurisdictions. The question of whether  the  wages
         paid in June 2010  are  taxable  in  this  jurisdiction  is  to  be
         determined by reference only to services performed  in  that  month
         and services performed in the previous  months  of  that  financial
         year must be disregarded. As a result, the wages paid in June  2010
         are taxable in this jurisdiction because of subsection (1)(a).

         The services performed in the previous  months  of  that  financial
         year will be relevant to the question of whether wages paid in each
         of those months are taxable in this jurisdiction, which  will  need
         to be determined having regard to subsection (1)(a) and (b).

      (4)   If no services are performed by an employee  in  respect  of  an
         employer during the month in which the wages are paid or payable to
         or in relation to the employee:

         (a)      the question of whether the  wages  are  taxable  in  this
             jurisdiction is to be determined  by  reference  only  to  the
             services performed by the employee in respect of the  employer
             during the most recent  prior  month  in  which  the  employee
             performed services in respect of the employer; and

         (b)      the wages are taken to  be  paid  or  payable  for  or  in
             relation to the services performed by the employee in  respect
             of the employer during that most recent prior month.

      (5)   If no services were performed by an employee in  respect  of  an
         employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable to  or
         in relation to the employee or in any prior month:

         (a)      the wages are taken to  be  paid  or  payable  for  or  in
             relation to services performed by the employee in the month in
             which the wages are paid or payable; and

         (b)      the services are taken to have been performed at  a  place
             or places  where  it  may  be  reasonably  expected  that  the
             services of the employee in respect of the  employer  will  be
             performed.

      (6)   All amounts of wages paid or payable in the same  month  by  the
         same employer in respect of the same employee are to be  aggregated
         for the purposes of determining whether they are  taxable  in  this
         jurisdiction (as if they were paid  or  payable  for  all  services
         performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are  paid
         or payable, or the most recent prior month, as the case requires).

         Example for subsection (6)

         If one amount of wages is paid by an employer in a particular month
         for services performed in this jurisdiction, and another amount  of
         wages is paid by the same employer in the same month  for  services
         performed by the same employee in another Australian  jurisdiction,
         the wages paid are to be aggregated (as if they were paid  for  all
         services performed by the employee  in  that  month).  Accordingly,
         subsection (1)(b) would be applied for the purpose  of  determining
         whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction.

      (7)   If wages are paid in a different month from the month  in  which
         they are payable, the question of whether the wages are taxable  in
         this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference to  the  earlier
         of the relevant months.

11A   Jurisdiction in which employee is based

      (1)   For this Act, the jurisdiction in which an employee is based  is
         the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  employeeâs  principal  place  of
         residence is located.

      (2)   The jurisdiction  in  which  an  employee  is  based  is  to  be
         determined by reference to the state of affairs existing during the
         month in which the relevant wages are paid or payable.

      (3)   If more than one jurisdiction would qualify as the  jurisdiction
         in which an employee is based during a month, the  jurisdiction  in
         which the employee is based is to be determined by reference to the
         state of affairs existing on the last day of that month.

      (4)   An employee who does not have a principal place of residence  is
         taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be an employee who  is  not
         based in an Australian jurisdiction.

      (5)   In the case of wages paid or payable to  a  corporate  employee,
         the jurisdiction in which the employee is based is to be determined
         in accordance with section 11B instead of this  section  (as  if  a
         reference in section 11B to an employer  were  a  reference  to  an
         employee).

      (6)   In this section:

         corporate employee means:

         (a)      a company that is taken to be an employee under section 34
             or 39; or

         (b)      a company to whom a payment is made that is  taken  to  be
             wages payable to an employee under section 42 or 47.

11B   Jurisdiction in which employer is based

      (1)   For this Act, the jurisdiction in which  an  employer  is  based
         is:

         (a)       the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  employerâs  registered
             business address is located (if the employer has an ABN); or

         (b)      the jurisdiction in which the employerâs  principal  place
             of business is located (in any other case).

      (2)   If wages are paid or  payable  in  connection  with  a  business
         carried on by an employer under a trust, the employerâs  registered
         business address is the registered business address  of  the  trust
         or, if the trust does not have  an  ABN,  the  registered  business
         address of the trustee of the trust.

      (3)   If an employer has  registered  business  addresses  located  in
         different jurisdictions at the same point in time, the jurisdiction
         in which the employer is  based  at  that  point  in  time  is  the
         jurisdiction in which the employerâs principal place of business is
         located.

      (4)   The jurisdiction  in  which  an  employer  is  based  is  to  be
         determined by reference to the state of affairs existing during the
         month in which the relevant wages are paid or payable.

      (5)   If more than one jurisdiction would qualify as the  jurisdiction
         in which an employer is based during a month, the  jurisdiction  in
         which the employer is based is to be determined by reference to the
         state of affairs existing on the last day of that month.

      (6)   An employer who has neither a registered business address nor  a
         principal place of business is taken, for the purposes of this Act,
         to be an employer who is not based in an Australian jurisdiction.

11C   Place and date of payment of wages

      (1)   For this Act, wages are taken to have been paid at a  place  if,
         for the purpose of the payment of those wages:

         (a)      an instrument is sent or given or an amount is transferred
             by an employer to a person or a personâs agent at that  place;
             or

         (b)      an instruction is given by an employer for  the  crediting
             of an amount to the account of a person or a personâs agent at
             that place.

      (2)   The wages are taken to have been  paid  on  the  date  that  the
         instrument was sent or given, the amount  was  transferred  or  the
         account credited in accordance with the instruction  (as  the  case
         requires).

      (3)   Wages are taken to be payable at the place  at  which  they  are
         paid, subject to this section.

      (4)   Wages that are not paid by the end of the month  in  which  they
         are payable are taken to be payable at:

         (a)      the place where wages were last paid by  the  employer  to
             the employee; or

         (b)      if wages have not previously been paid by the employer  to
             the employee â the place where  the  employee  last  performed
             services in respect of the employer before  the  wages  became
             payable.

      (5)   If wages paid or payable in the same month by the same  employer
         in respect of the same employee are paid or payable  in  more  than
         one Australian jurisdiction, the wages  paid  or  payable  in  that
         month  are  taken  to  be  paid  or  payable  in   the   Australian
         jurisdiction in which the highest proportion of the wages are  paid
         or payable.

         Note for subsection (5)

         Section 11(6) requires all wages paid or payable in the same  month
         by the same  employer  in  respect  of  the  same  employee  to  be
         aggregated for the purpose of determining  whether  the  wages  are
         taxable in this jurisdiction.  This  subsection  ensures  only  one
         Australian jurisdiction can be considered to be the jurisdiction in
         which the wages are paid or payable.

Division 3  Other matters

12    Payroll tax paid under corresponding applied law

         Note

         This section is contained in some corresponding payroll  tax  laws.
         It does not apply in the Territory because the Commonwealth  Places
         (Mirror Taxes) ActÂ 1998 (Cth) does not apply to the Territory  (see
         Schedule 1 to that Act).

Part 3      Wages

Division 1  General concept of wages

13    What are wages

       (1)    For  this  Act,  wages  mean  wages,   remuneration,   salary,
         commission, bonuses or allowances paid or payable to  an  employee,
         including:

         (a)      an amount paid or payable by  way  of  remuneration  to  a
             person holding an office under the Crown or in the service  of
             the Crown; and

         (b)      an amount paid or payable  under  any  class  of  contract
             prescribed by regulation to the extent to which  that  payment
             is attributable to labour; and

         (c)      an  amount  paid  or  payable  by  a  company  by  way  of
             remuneration to or in relation to a director of that  company;
             and

         (d)      an amount paid or payable  by  way  of  commission  to  an
             insurance or time-payment canvasser or collector; and

         (e)      an amount that is included as or taken to be wages by  any
             other provision of this Act.

      (2)   For this Act, wages, remuneration, salary,  commission,  bonuses
         or allowances are wages:

         (a)      whether paid or payable at piece work rates or  otherwise;
             and

         (b)      whether paid or payable in cash or in kind.

      (3)   This Act applies in respect of  wages  mentioned  in  subsection
         (1)(a) toÂ (e) that are paid or payable  to  or  in  relation  to  a
         person who is not an employee in the same  way  as  it  applies  to
         wages paid or payable to an employee (as if a reference in this Act
         to an employee included a reference to any such person).

Division 2  Fringe benefits

14    Wages include fringe benefits

      (1)   For this Act, wages include a fringe benefit.

      (2)   Subsection (1) does  not  apply  to  benefits  that  are  exempt
         benefits  for  the  FBTA  Act   (other   than   deposits   to   the
         Superannuation Holding Accounts Special Account within the  meaning
         of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 (Cth)).

15    Value of wages comprising fringe benefits

      (1)   For this Act, the value of wages comprising a fringe benefit  is
         to be determined in accordance with the formula:

         [pic]

         where:

         TV is the value that would be the taxable value of the benefit as a
         fringe benefit for the FBTA Act.

         FBT rate is the rate of fringe benefits tax imposed by the FBTA Act
         that applies when the liability  to  payroll  tax  under  this  Act
         arises.

      (2)   In this Act, a reference to taxable  wages  that  were  paid  or
         payable by an employer during a month is, in  relation  to  taxable
         wages comprising fringe benefits:

         (a)      a reference to the value of the fringe  benefits  paid  or
             payable by the employer during the month; or

         (b)      if an election by the employer is in force  under  section
             16, a reference to an amount  calculated  in  accordance  with
             that section.

      (3)   In this Act, a reference to taxable  wages  that  were  paid  or
         payable by an employer during a year is,  in  relation  to  taxable
         wages  comprising  fringe  benefits,  a  reference  to  an   amount
         calculated by adding together the amounts  under  subsectionÂ (2)(a)
         or (b), or subsection (2)(a) andÂ (b), as the case requires, for the
         months of that year.

16    Employer election regarding taxable value of fringe benefits

      (1)   An employer who has paid or is liable  to  pay  fringe  benefits
         tax imposed by the FBTA Act in respect of a period of not less than
         15Â months before 30 June in any year may elect to  include  as  the
         value of the fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer during
         the month concerned:

         (a)      in a return lodged in relation to each  of  the  first  11
             months occurring after 30 June in that year â  1/12th  of  the
             amount determined in accordance with subsection  (2)  or  that
             part  of  that  amount  as,  in  accordance  with  sectionÂ 10,
             comprises taxable wages  for  the  year  of  tax  (within  the
             meaning of the FBTA Act)  ending  on  31Â March  preceding  the
             commencement of the current financial year; and

         (b)      in the return lodged in relation to the 12thÂ month  â  the
             amount determined in accordance with subsection  (2)  or  that
             part  of  that  amount  as,  in  accordance  with  sectionÂ 10,
             comprises taxable wages  for  the  year  of  tax  (within  the
             meaning of the FBTA Act) ending on  31  March  preceding  that
             month, less the  total  of  the  amounts  of  fringe  benefits
             included in the returns for each of the preceding 11 months.

      (2)   The amount determined in accordance with this subsection  is  to
         be determined in accordance with the formula:

         [pic]

         where:

         AFBA is the aggregate fringe benefits amount within the meaning  of
         section 136 of the FBTA Act.

         FBT rate is the rate of fringe benefits tax imposed by the FBTA Act
         that applies when the liability  to  payroll  tax  under  this  Act
         arises.

      (3)   An election  under  subsection  (1)  takes  effect  when  it  is
         notified  to  the  Commissioner  in  the  form  approved   by   the
         Commissioner.

      (4)   After an employer has made an  election  under  subsection  (1),
         the employer must lodge returns containing  amounts  calculated  in
         accordance with the election unless the Commissioner  approves,  by
         notice in writing given to the employer,  the  termination  of  the
         election and allows the employer to include the value mentioned  in
         section 15(2)(a).

      (5)   If an employer ceases to be  liable  to  pay  payroll  tax,  the
         value of taxable wages comprising fringe benefits to be included in
         the employer's final return is (irrespective of whether or not  the
         employer has made an election under subsectionÂ (1))  the  value  of
         the fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer for the  period
         commencing on and including the preceding 1Â July until the date  on
         which the employer ceases to be liable to  payroll  tax,  less  the
         value of the fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer during
         that period on which payroll tax has been paid.

Division 3  Superannuation contributions

17    Wages include superannuation contributions

      (1)   For this Act, wages include a superannuation contribution.

      (2)   A superannuation contribution is a contribution paid or  payable
         by an employer in respect of an employee:

         (a)      to or as a superannuation fund within the meaning  of  the
             Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth); or

         (b)      as a superannuation guarantee charge within the meaning of
             the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration)  ActÂ 1992Â (Cth);
             or

         (c)      to or as any other form of  superannuation,  provident  or
             retirement fund or scheme including:

             (i) the Superannuation Holding Accounts Special Account within
                  the meaning of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act  1995
                  (Cth); and

             (ii)      a retirement savings account within the  meaning  of
                  the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 (Cth); and

             (iii)     a wholly or partly unfunded fund or scheme.

      (3)   Setting aside any money or anything that is worth money  as,  or
         as part of, a superannuation fund, superannuation guarantee  charge
         or any other form of superannuation, provident or  retirement  fund
         or scheme is taken to be paying a superannuation contribution.

      (4)   Making a superannuation contribution of anything that  is  worth
         money is taken to be paying a superannuation  contribution  of  the
         amount equal to its value, and its value is to  be  worked  out  in
         accordance with section 43 as  if  that  section  referred  to  the
         contribution instead of to wages.

      (5)   A superannuation, provident or  retirement  fund  or  scheme  is
         unfunded to the extent that money paid or payable by an employer in
         respect of an employee covered by the fund or scheme is not paid or
         payable during the employee's period of service with the employer.

      (6)   In this section:

         employee includes any person to whom, by virtue of a  paragraph  of
         the definition wages in section 13(1), an amount paid or payable in
         the circumstances mentioned in the paragraph constitutes wages.

Division 4  Shares and options

18    Inclusion of grant of shares and options as wages

      (1)   For this Act, wages include the grant of a share  or  an  option
         to an employee by an employer in respect of services  performed  by
         the employee if the share or option:

         (a)      is an ESS interest (within the meaning of  section  83A-10
             of the ITAA); and

         (b)      is granted to the employee under an employee share  scheme
             (within the meaning of that section).

         Note for subsection (1)

         A grant of a share or an option to an employee by an employer  that
         is not an ESS interest will be taxable as a  fringe  benefit  under
         Division 2 of this Part.

      (2)   Any such wages are taken, for the imposition of payroll tax,  to
         be paid or payable on the relevant day.

      (3)   For this Division, the relevant day  is  the  day  the  employer
         elects in accordance with this Division to  treat  as  the  day  on
         which the wages are paid or payable.

      (4)   To avoid doubt, the grant of  a  share  or  option  is  valuable
         consideration for sectionÂ 46.

19    Choice of relevant day

      (1)   The employer can elect to treat as the relevant day  either  the
         date on which the share or option is granted to the employee or the
         vesting date.

      (2)   A share or option is granted to a person if:

         (a)      another person transfers  the  share  or  option  to  that
             person (other than, in the case of a  share,  by  issuing  the
             share to that person); or

         (b)      for a share â another person  allots  the  share  to  that
             person; or

         (c)      for an option â another person confers the option  on,  or
             otherwise creates the option in, that person; or

         (d)      the person otherwise acquires  a  legal  interest  in  the
             share or option from another person; or

         (e)      the person acquires a beneficial interest in the share  or
             option from another person.

      (2A)  To avoid doubt, if an employee acquires a right to be granted  a
         share or an option, or some other material benefit, at the election
         of the employer, the share or  option  is  not  granted  until  the
         employer elects to grant the share or option.

      (3)   The vesting date in respect of a share is one of  the  following
         dates (whichever happens first):

         (a)      the date on which the share vests in  the  employee  (that
             is, when any conditions applying to the  grant  of  the  share
             have been met and the employee's legal or beneficial  interest
             in the share cannot be rescinded);

         (b)      the date at the end of the period of 7 years from the date
             on which the share is granted to the employee.

      (4)   The vesting  date  in  respect  of  an  option  is  one  of  the
         following dates (whichever happens first):

         (a)      the date on which the share to which the option relates is
             granted to the employee;

         (b)      the date on which the employee exercises a right under the
             option to have the share the subject of the option transferred
             to, allotted to or vested in the employee;

         (c)      the date at the end of the period of 7 years from the date
             on which the option is granted to the employee.

20    Deemed choice of relevant day in special cases

      (1)   If an employer grants a share or option to an employee  and  the
         value of the grant of the share or option is not  included  in  the
         taxable wages of the employer for the financial year in  which  the
         share or option was granted, the employer is taken to have  elected
         to treat the wages constituted by the grant of that share or option
         as being paid or payable on the vesting date.

      (2)   If an employer grants a share or option to an employee  and  the
         value of the grant of the  share  or  option  is  nil  or,  if  the
         employer were to elect to treat the date of grant as  the  relevant
         day, the wages constituted by the grant  would  not  be  liable  to
         payroll tax, the employer is taken to have  elected  to  treat  the
         wages constituted by the grant of that share  or  option  as  being
         paid or payable on the date  on  which  the  share  or  option  was
         granted.

21    Effect of rescission or cancellation of share or option

      (1)   If the grant of a share or option  is  withdrawn,  cancelled  or
         exchanged before the vesting date for  any  valuable  consideration
         (other than the grant of other shares or  options),  the  following
         provisions apply:

         (a)      the date of withdrawal, cancellation or exchange is  taken
             to be the vesting date of the share or option;

         (b)      the market value of the share or option,  on  the  vesting
             date, is taken to be the amount of the valuable  consideration
             (and, accordingly, that amount is the amount paid  or  payable
             as wages on that date).

      (2)   If an employer includes the value of  a  grant  of  a  share  or
         option in the taxable wages of the employer for  a  financial  year
         and the grant is rescinded because the conditions attaching to  the
         grant were not met, the taxable  wages  of  the  employer,  in  the
         financial year in which the grant is rescinded, are to  be  reduced
         by the value of the grant as previously  included  in  the  taxable
         wages of the employer.

      (3)   Subsection (2) does not apply just because an employee fails  to
         exercise an option or to otherwise exercise his or  her  rights  in
         respect of a share or option.

22    Grant of share pursuant to exercise of option

         The grant of the share by an employer does not constitute wages for
         this Act if the employer is  required  to  grant  the  share  as  a
         consequence of the exercise of an option by a person and:

         (a)      the grant of the option to the  person  constitutes  wages
             for this Act; or

         (b)      the option was granted to the person before 1Â July 1999.

23    Value of shares and options

      (1)   If the grant of a share or option constitutes wages  under  this
         Division, the amount paid or payable as wages is  taken,  for  this
         Act, to  be  the  value  of  the  share  or  option  (expressed  in
         Australian currency) on the relevant day,  less  the  consideration
         (if any) paid or given by the employee in respect of the  share  or
         option  (other  than  consideration  in  the   form   of   services
         performed).

      (2)   The value of a share or an option is:

         (a)      the market value; or

         (b)      the amount determined as provided for by the  Commonwealth
             income tax provisions.

      (3)   The employer may elect the method by which the value of a  share
         or an option is determined in any return lodged under this Act.

      (4)   However, the Commissioner may determine the method by which  the
         value of a share or an option is determined if  the  grant  of  the
         share or option is not included as wages in a return lodged  by  an
         employer as required by this Act.

      (5)   In determining the market value of a share or  option,  anything
         that would prevent or restrict conversion of the share or option to
         money is to be disregarded.

      (6)   The Commonwealth income tax provisions apply with the  following
         modifications, and any other necessary modifications:

         (a)      the value of an option is to be determined as if it were a
             right to acquire a beneficial interest in a share;

         (b)      a reference to the acquisition of a beneficial interest in
             a share or right is to be read as a reference to the grant  of
             a share or an option.

      (7)   In this section:

         Commonwealth income tax provisions means  section  83A-315  of  the
         ITAA and the regulations made for that section.

         Note for definition Commonwealth income tax provisions

         See Division 83A of the  Income  Tax  Assessment  Regulations  1997
         (Cth) for the relevant regulations.

24    Inclusion of shares and options granted to directors as wages

      (1)   For this Act, wages include the grant of a share  or  an  option
         by a company to a director of the company who is not an employee of
         the company by way of remuneration for the appointment or  services
         of the director.

      (2)   For that purpose, the other provisions of  this  Division  apply
         in respect of any such grant as if a reference to the employer were
         a reference to the company and a reference to the employee  were  a
         reference to the director of the company.

      (3)   In this section, a  reference  to  a  director  of  the  company
         includes a reference to the following:

         (a)      a person who, under a contract or other arrangement, is to
             be appointed as a director of the company;

         (b)      a former director of the company.

      (4)   However, if  wages  referred  to  in  this  section  are  fringe
         benefits, the value of the wages is to be determined in  accordance
         with DivisionÂ 2 of this Part (and not this Division).

         Note for section 24

         Section 13 provides that a reference to an  employee  in  this  Act
         includes a reference to any person  to  whom  any  amount  that  is
         treated as wages under this  Act  is  paid  or  payable.  See  also
         section 11, under which the wages are taken to be paid  or  payable
         for services performed.

26    Place where wages are payable

      (1)   The wages constituted by the grant of the share  or  option  are
         taken to be paid or payable in this jurisdiction if the share is  a
         share in a local company or, in the case of an option, an option to
         acquire shares in a local company.

      (2)   In any other case, the wages constituted by  the  grant  of  the
         share or option are taken  to  be  paid  or  payable  outside  this
         jurisdiction.

         Note for subsection (2)

         The place where wages are paid or payable is sometimes relevant  to
         determining whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction. See
         section 11.

      (3)   In this section:

         local company means:

         (a)      a company incorporated or taken to be  incorporated  under
             the Corporations Act 2001 that is taken to  be  registered  in
             this jurisdiction for that Act; or

         (b)      any other body corporate that is incorporated under an Act
             of this jurisdiction.

Division 5  Termination payments

27    Definitions

         In this Division:

         employment termination payment means:

         (a)      an employment termination payment within  the  meaning  of
             section 82-130 of the ITAA; or

         (b)      a payment that would be an employment termination  payment
             within the meaning of section 82-130 of the ITAA but  for  the
             fact that it was  received  later  than  12Â months  after  the
             termination of a person's employment; or

         (c)      a transitional termination payment within the  meaning  of
             section 82-10 of  the  Income  Tax  (Transitional  Provisions)
             ActÂ 1997 (Cth).

         termination payment means:

         (a)      a payment made in consequence of the retirement  from,  or
             termination of, any  office  or  employment  of  an  employee,
             being:

             (i) an unused annual leave payment; or

             (ii)      an unused long service leave payment; or

             (iii)     so much of an employment termination payment paid or
                  payable by  an  employer,  whether  or  not  paid  to  the
                  employee or to any other person or  body,  that  would  be
                  included in the assessable income  of  an  employee  under
                  Part 2-40 of the ITAA  if  the  whole  of  the  employment
                  termination payment had been paid to the employee; or

         (b)      an amount paid or payable by a company as a consequence of
             the termination of the services or office of a director of the
             company, whether or not paid to the director or to  any  other
             person or  body,  that  would  be  an  employment  termination
             payment  if  that  amount  had  been  paid  or  payable  as  a
             consequence of termination of employment; or

         (c)      an amount paid or payable by a person who is  an  employer
             under a relevant contract (within the meaning  of  sectionÂ 32)

             services of an employee under the  contract,  whether  or  not
             paid to the employee or to any other  person,  if  the  amount
             would be an employment termination payment if that amount  had
             been paid or  payable  as  a  consequence  of  termination  of
             employment.

         unused annual leave payment has the same meaning as in  sectionÂ 83-
         10 of the ITAA.

         unused long service leave  payment  has  the  same  meaning  as  in
         section 83-75 of the ITAA.

28    Termination payments

         For this Act, wages include a termination payment.

Division 6  Allowances

29    Motor vehicle allowances

      (1)   For this Act, wages, in respect of  a  financial  year,  do  not
         include the exempt component of a motor vehicle allowance  paid  or
         payable in respect of that year.

      (2)   Accordingly, if  the  total  motor  vehicle  allowance  paid  or
         payable to an employee in respect of  a  financial  year  does  not
         exceed the exempt component, the motor  vehicle  allowance  is  not
         wages for this Act.

      (3)   If the total motor vehicle  allowance  paid  or  payable  to  an
         employee  in  respect  of  a  financial  year  exceeds  the  exempt
         component (if  any),  only  the  amount  that  exceeds  the  exempt
         component of the motor vehicle allowance is included as  wages  for
         this Act.

      (4)   The exempt component  of  a  motor  vehicle  allowance  paid  or
         payable in respect of a financial year is calculated in  accordance
         with the formula:

         E = K ( R

         where:

         E  is the exempt component.

         K  is the  number  of  business  kilometres  travelled  during  the
         financial year.

         R  is the exempt rate.

       (5)    The  number  of  business  kilometres  travelled  during   the
         financial year (K) is to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the
         continuous recording method, or  the  averaging  method,  whichever
         method is selected and used by  the  employer  in  accordance  with
         Schedule 1, Part 5.

      (6)   The Commissioner, by order in writing, may approve the  use,  by
         an employer or class of employer, of another method of  determining
         the number of business kilometres travelled  during  the  financial
         year (including the use of an estimate).   If  so,  the  number  of
         business kilometres travelled during the financial year  is  to  be
         determined  in  accordance  with  the  method   approved   by   the
         Commissioner.

      (7)   For this  section,  the  exempt  rate  for  the  financial  year
         concerned is:

         (a)       the  rate  of  cents  per  kilometre   determined   under
             sectionÂ 28-25(4) of  the  ITAA  for  subsection  (1)  of  that
             section  in  the  financial  year  immediately  preceding  the
             financial year in which the allowance is paid or payable; or

         (b)      if no rate of cents per kilometre mentioned  in  paragraph
             (a) is determined, the rate  prescribed  by  regulation  under
             this Act.

30    Accommodation allowances

      (1)   For this Act, wages do not include  an  accommodation  allowance
         paid or payable to an employee in respect of a night's absence from
         the person's usual place of residence  that  does  not  exceed  the
         exempt rate.

      (2)   If the accommodation allowance paid or payable  to  an  employee
         in respect of a night's absence from the person's  usual  place  of
         residence exceeds the exempt rate,  wages  include  that  allowance
         only to the extent it exceeds the exempt rate.

      (3)   For this  section,  the  exempt  rate  for  the  financial  year
         concerned is:

         (a)      the total reasonable amount  for  daily  travel  allowance
             expenses using the lowest capital city for the  lowest  salary
             band for the financial year determined by the Commissioner  of
             Taxation of the Commonwealth; or

         (b)      if no  determination  mentioned  in  paragraphÂ (a)  is  in
             force, the rate prescribed by regulation.

32    What is a relevant contract

      (1)    In  this  Division,  a  relevant  contract  in  relation  to  a
         financial year is a contract under which a person  (the  designated
         person) during that financial year, in the  course  of  a  business
         carried on by the designated person:

         (a)      supplies to another person services for or in relation  to
             the performance of work; or

         (b)      has supplied to the  designated  person  the  services  of
             persons for or in relation to the performance of work; or

             person is a member of a  group,  to  another  member  of  that
             group.

      (2)   However, a relevant contract does  not  include  a  contract  of
         service or a contract under which a person (the designated  person)
         during a financial year in the course of a business carried  on  by
         the designated person:

         (a)      is supplied with  services  for  or  in  relation  to  the
             performance of work that are ancillary to the supply of  goods

             supplied or to the use of goods which are the property of that
             person; or

         (b)      is supplied with  services  for  or  in  relation  to  the
             performance of work where:

             (i) those services are of a kind not  ordinarily  required  by
                  the designated person and are performed by  a  person  who
                  ordinarily performs services of that kind  to  the  public
                  generally; or

             (ii)      those services are of a kind ordinarily required  by
                  the  designated  person  for  less  than  180  days  in  a
                  financial year; or

             (iii)     those services are provided for a period  that  does
                  not exceed 90 days or for periods that, in the  aggregate,
                  do not exceed 90 days in that financial year and  are  not
                  services:

                  (A)  provided by a person by  whom  similar  services  are
                      provided to the designated person; or

                  (B)  for or in relation to the performance of  work  where
                      any of the persons who perform the work also  perform
                      similar work for the designated person;

                 for periods that, in the aggregate, exceed 90 days in that
                  financial year; or

             (iv)      those services are  supplied  under  a  contract  to
                  which subparagraphs (i) to (iii)  do  not  apply  and  the
                  Commissioner is satisfied those services are performed  by
                  a person who ordinarily performs services of that kind  to
                  the public generally in that financial year; or

         (c)      is supplied by a person (the contractor) with services for
             or in relation to the performance of work under a contract  to
             which paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply where  the  work  to
             which the services relate is performed:

             (i) by 2 or more persons employed by, or who provide  services
                  for, the contractor in the course of a business carried on

      (4)   However, an entity is not an excluded entity if a  determination
         under section 48E is in force in relation to the entity.

48B   Meaning of trade, industry or commerce entity

      (1)   An entity is a trade, industry or commerce entity if:

         (a)      a purpose of the entity is to promote trade,  industry  or
             commerce (whether generally or in respect  of  any  particular
             kind of trade, industry or commerce); and

         (b)      the entity is not an entity mentioned in section 48A(3)(a)
             toÂ (f).

      (2)   However, an entity is not a trade, industry or  commerce  entity
         if:

         (a)      the entity's sole or predominant purpose is a  category  1
             to 3 purpose; or

         (b)      the entity has 2 or more purposes that:

             (i) are each category 1 to 3 purposes; and

             (ii)       together  constitute   the   entity's   predominant
                  purpose.

48C   Non-profit entities â exempt wages

      (1)   Wages are exempt wages if the  Commissioner  is  satisfied  that
         the wages:

         (a)      are paid or payable by a non-profit entity that carries on
             charitable activities; and

         (b)      are paid or payable to a person who is engaged exclusively
             in work of a kind ordinarily performed in connection with  the
             carrying on of charitable activities by the entity.

      (2)   A non-profit entity carries  on  charitable  activities  if  the
         entity directly  carries  out  work  that  is  predominantly  of  a
         religious,  charitable,  benevolent,  philanthropic  or   patriotic
         nature.

      (3)   For subsection (2), giving money to another entity that  carries
         out work of the kind mentioned  in  subsection  (2)  does  not,  by
         itself, constitute carrying on a charitable activity.

48D   Determining purpose of entity

         For this Division, the purpose or purposes of an entity are  to  be
         determined  having  regard  to  all  the   relevant   circumstances
         including the entity's stated objects (if any) and its activities.

48E   Commissioner may override exclusion

      (1)   The Commissioner may, by order in  writing,  determine  that  an
         entity that would, but for the determination, be an excluded entity
         under section 48A(3)(f) or (g) is not an excluded entity.

      (2)   The Commissioner may do so only if satisfied there  are  special
         reasons that justify the  entity  being  treated  as  a  non-profit
         entity for the purposes of this Division.

      (3)   In deciding whether to make a  determination,  the  Commissioner
         may have regard to the following:

         (a)      the significance of the excluding feature of the entity in
             relation to the purposes of the entity considered as a whole;

         (b)      the extent to which the entity's purposes are  category  1
             to 3 purposes or are otherwise beneficial to the community;

         (c)      the extent to which the  entity's  purposes  are,  or  are
             intended to be, beneficial to a particular  class  of  persons
             (whether or  not  members  of  the  entity)  rather  than  the
             community generally;

         (d)      any other factors the Commissioner considers relevant.

      (4)   A determination may be expressed to take effect on a  date  that
         is:

         (a)      earlier than the date of the determination; but

         (b)      not earlier than 1 July 2015.

       (5)    The  Commissioner  may,  by  order  in   writing,   revoke   a
         determination  if  the  Commissioner  ceases  to  be  satisfied  as
         mentioned in subsection (2).

      (6)   A revocation of a determination may be expressed to take  effect
         on a date that is earlier than the date of the revocation.

      (7)   In this section:

         excluding feature of an entity, means a purpose, object or activity
         of the entity that  would,  but  for  a  determination  under  this
         section, cause it to be an excluded entity.

         (a)      for work of a kind ordinarily performed in connection with
             the conduct of a health care service provider; and

         (b)      to a person engaged exclusively in that kind of work.

      (3)   For this section, health care service provider has  the  meaning
         given in Schedule 2, Part 4, Division 2.

52    Division not to limit other exemptions

      (1)   Nothing in this Division limits the  application  of  any  other
         Division of this Part.

      (2)   For example, if a health care service provider is  also  a  non-

         Note for subsection (1)

         Clause 20 of Schedule  2  provides  for  a  similar  exemption  for
         paternity leave given to a male employee.  That  exemption  is  not
         included in some corresponding payroll tax laws.

      (2)   It is immaterial whether the leave is taken during or after  the
         pregnancy or before or after the adoption.

      (3)   The exemption is limited to wages paid or payable in respect  of
         a  maximum  of  14Â weeks  maternity  leave  in   respect   of   any

             period of leave is a reference to the total wages  that  would
             normally have been paid or payable for that period of leave.

         Example for subsection (4)

         For a part-time employee, the exemption may apply to wages paid  or
         payable for maternity leave or adoption leave that  extends  to  28
         weeks at half of the part-time rate  of  pay  that  would  normally
         apply to the employee.

      (5)   The exemption does not apply  to  any  part  of  wages  paid  or
         payable in respect of maternity or adoption  leave  that  comprises
         fringe benefits.

         The fact that a person is not a member of a group constituted under

         50% of the value of the interests in the trust.

Division 3  Business groups tracing of interests in corporations

75    Application

         This Division applies for sectionÂ 73.

76    Direct interest

      (1)   An entity has a direct interest in a corporation if:

         (a)      in the case of an entity that is a  person  â  the  person
             can, directly or indirectly, exercise,  control  the  exercise
             of, or substantially influence the  exercise  of,  the  voting
             power attached to any voting shares issued by the corporation;
             or

         (b)      in the case of an entity that is 2 or more persons who are
             associated persons â  each  of  the  associated  persons  can,
             directly or indirectly, exercise, control the exercise of,  or
             substantially influence the  exercise  of,  the  voting  power
             attached to any voting shares issued by the corporation.

      (2)    The  value  of  the  direct  interest  of  the  entity  in  the
         corporation is the proportion (expressed as a  percentage)  of  the
         voting power of all voting shares issued by the corporation that:

         (a)      in the case of an entity that is a person â the person can
             directly or indirectly exercise, control the exercise  of,  or
             substantially influence  the  exercise  of,  as  mentioned  in
             subsection (1); or

         (b)      in the case of an entity that is 2 or more persons who are
             associated persons â the associated  persons  can,  if  acting
             together,  directly  or  indirectly  exercise,   control   the
             exercise of, or substantially influence the  exercise  of,  as
             mentioned in subsection (1).

77    Indirect interest

      (1)   An entity has an indirect  interest  in  a  corporation  if  the
         corporation  is  linked  to  another  corporation   (the   directly
         controlled corporation) in which the entity has a direct interest.

      (2)   A corporation is linked to a directly controlled corporation  if
         the corporation is part of a chain of corporations:

         (a)      that starts with the directly controlled corporation; and

         (b)      in which a link in the chain is formed  if  a  corporation
             has a direct interest in the next corporation in the chain.

      (3)   The following are examples of how subsections (1) and  (2)  work
         (the examples are cumulative):

         (a)      corporation A (a directly controlled  corporation)  has  a
             direct interest in corporation B. Corporations A  and  B  form
             part of a chain of corporations, and corporation B  is  linked
             to corporation A. Accordingly, an entity  that  has  a  direct
             interest in corporation A also has  an  indirect  interest  in
             corporation B;

         (b)      corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation C.
             In this case, corporations A, B and C form part of a chain  of
             corporations.  Both  corporations  B  and  C  are  linked   to
             corporation A. The  entity  that  has  a  direct  interest  in
             corporation A has an indirect interest in both corporations  B
             and C;

         (c)      corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation D.
             There are now 2 chains of corporations, one consisting of A, B
             and C, and one consisting of A, B and D. Corporations B, C and
             D are all linked to corporation A and an  entity  that  has  a
             direct interest  in  corporation  A  would  have  an  indirect
             interest in corporations B, C and D.  An  entity  that  has  a
             direct interest  in  corporation  B  would  have  an  indirect
             interest in corporations C and D. However, an entity that  has
             a direct interest in corporation C  only  would  not  have  an
             indirect interest in corporation D, as corporation  D  is  not
             linked to corporation C.

       (4)    The  value  of  the  indirect  interest  of  an  entity  in  a
         corporation (an indirectly controlled corporation) that  is  linked
         to a directly controlled corporation is calculated  by  multiplying
         together the following:

         (a)      the value of the direct interest  of  the  entity  in  the
             directly controlled corporation;

         (b)      the value of each direct interest that forms a link in the
             chain of  corporations  by  which  the  indirectly  controlled
             corporation is linked to the directly controlled corporation.

      (5)   The following are examples of  how  subsection  (4)  works  (the
         examples are cumulative):

         (a)      an entity has a direct interest (with a value of  80%)  in
             corporation A. Corporation A has a  direct  interest  (with  a
             value of 70%) in corporation B.  The  value  of  the  indirect
             interest of the entity in corporation B is 80% Ã 70% (that is,
             56%).  Accordingly,  in  this  example  the   entity   has   a
             controlling interest (within the meaning  of  section  73)  in
             corporation B;

         (b)      corporation B also has a direct interest (with a value  of
             40%) in corporation C. The value of the indirect  interest  of
             the entity in corporation C is 80%  Ã  70%  Ã  40%  (that  is,
             22(4%). Accordingly, in this example the entity does not  have
             a controlling interest in corporation C.

      (6)   It is possible for an  entity  to  have  more  than  1  indirect
         interest in a corporation. This may occur  if  the  corporation  is
         linked to more than 1 corporation in which the entity has a  direct
         interest, or if the corporation is linked to only 1 corporation  in
         which the entity has a direct interest but is linked  through  more
         than 1 chain of corporations. In  that  case,  the  entity  has  an
         aggregate interest in the corporation (see sectionÂ 78).

78    Aggregation of interests

      (1)   An entity has an aggregate interest in a corporation if:

         (a)      the entity has a direct interest and 1  or  more  indirect
             interests in the corporation; or

         (b)      the entity has  more  than  1  indirect  interest  in  the
             corporation.

      (2)    The  value  of  the  aggregate  interest  of  an  entity  in  a
         corporation is the sum of the following:

         (a)      the value of the direct interest (if any) of the entity in
             the corporation;

         (b)      the value of each indirect interest of the entity  in  the
             corporation.

      (3)   For example:

         (a)      an entity has a direct interest (with a value of  40%)  in
             corporation B; and

         (b)      the entity also has a direct interest  (with  a  value  of
             25%) in corporation A, which in turn  has  a  direct  interest
             (with a value of  60%)  in  corporation  B.  Accordingly,  the
             entity also has an indirect interest in corporation B  with  a
             value of 15% (that is, 25% Ã 60%); and

         (c)       the  value  of  the  entity's   aggregate   interest   in
             corporation B is the sum of the direct interest (40%) and  the
             indirect interest (15%), which is 55%; and

         (d)      accordingly, in this example, the entity has a controlling
             interest in corporation B (within the meaning of section 73).

79    Exclusion of persons from groups

      (1)   The Commissioner may, by order  in  writing,  determine  that  a

         any member of the group to be the designated group employer for the
         group for this Act.

      (4)   If the members of a group do  not  designate  a  member  as  the

         requires, in respect of that financial year.

      (2)   This Part applies in respect of  payroll  tax  paid  or  payable
         whether as a group employer or as an individual employer.

      (3)   If an employer is liable for payroll tax both as  an  individual
         employer and as a group employer (forÂ different periods in the same
         financial year) separate adjustments are  to  be  made  under  this
         Part, or clause 15 of Schedule 2, as the case requires, in  respect
         of any period as a group employer and any period as  an  individual
         employer (and for  that  purpose  separate  determinations  of  the
         correct amount of payroll tax payable by the  employer  are  to  be
         made).

      (4)   In this Part:

         group employer means an employer who is a member of a group.

         individual employer means an employer who is  not  a  member  of  a
         group.

83    Annual adjustment of payroll tax

      (1)   If the amount of payroll tax paid  or  payable  by  an  employer
         (other than a group employer) when the employer  made  the  returns
         relating to a financial year is greater than the correct amount  of
         payroll tax payable by the employer in  respect  of  the  financial
         year, the Commissioner (on  application  by  the  employer)  is  to
         refund to that employer an amount equal to the difference.

      (2)   If the amount of payroll tax paid  or  payable  by  an  employer
         (other than a group employer) when the employer  made  the  returns
         relating to a financial year is less than  the  correct  amount  of
         payroll tax payable by the employer in  respect  of  the  financial
         year, the employer must pay to the Commissioner as payroll  tax  an
         amount equal to the difference.

      (3)   Any  amount  payable  by  an  employer  under  this  section  or
         clauseÂ 15 of Schedule 2 in respect of a financial year must be paid
         within the period during which the employer is required to lodge  a
         return under this Act in respect of the return period  that  is  or
         includes the month of June in that financial year.

      (4)   The amount of any refund payable to an employer in respect of  a
         financial year under this section or clause 15 of Schedule 2 is  to
         be reduced by the amount of any other refund of payroll tax made in
         respect of that financial year to that employer (whether under this
         section or otherwise) before the time  of  the  refund  under  this
         section.

         Note

         Clause 15 of Schedule 2 applies to group employers.

84    Adjustment of payroll tax when employer changes circumstances

      (1)   If an employer changes the  employer's  circumstances  during  a
         financial year, the employer must, if the  amount  of  payroll  tax
         paid or payable by the employer  when  the  employer  made  returns
         relating  to  the  relevant  period  prior   to   the   change   of
         circumstances is less  than  the  correct  amount  of  payroll  tax
         payable by the employer in respect of the financial  year,  pay  to
         the Commissioner as payroll tax an amount equal to the difference.

      (2)   A change of circumstances occurs when the employer:

         (a)      ceases to pay or  be  liable  to  pay  taxable  wages  and
             interstate wages; or

         (b)      becomes  a  group  employer  (following  a  period  as  an
             individual employer); or

         (c)      ceases to be a group employer (and becomes  an  individual
             employer).

      (3)   The relevant period prior to a change of  circumstances  is  the
         period prior to the change (during the financial year concerned and
         since any prior change of circumstances)  for  which  the  employer
         paid or was liable to pay taxable wages or interstate wages.

      (4)   In calculating for this section the correct  amount  of  payroll
         tax payable by the employer, it is to be  assumed  that  the  wages
         paid or payable by the employer during the relevant period are  the
         only wages paid or payable by the  employer  during  the  financial
         year concerned.

      (5)   Any amount payable by an employer under this section in  respect
         of a relevant period must be paid within the  period  during  which
         the employer is required to lodge a return under this Act  relating
         to that relevant period or the last return under this Act  relating
         to the relevant period.

      (6)   Any payroll tax paid  or  payable  by  an  employer  under  this
         section is to be included as payroll tax paid  or  payable  by  the
         employer for the annual adjustment of payroll tax under this Part.

         Note

         If an employer ceases to be a group  employer  during  a  financial
         year an adjustment will be made under this  section.  If  later  in
         that financial year the employer ceases to pay wages there will  be
         a further adjustment under this section. The first adjustment  will
         adjust payroll tax paid for the period as a group employer  against
         the correct amount of tax that should have been paid (based on  the
         assumption that the period as a group employer is the  only  period
         for which the employer paid wages throughout the year). The  second
         adjustment will adjust payroll  tax  paid  for  the  period  as  an
         individual employer against the correct amount of tax  that  should
         have been paid (based on the  assumption  that  the  period  as  an
         individual employer is the only period for which the employer  paid
         wages throughout the year). Any amount of payroll  tax  paid  under
         this section is taken into account for  the  annual  adjustment  of
         payroll tax.

85    Special provision where wages fluctuate

         If a person who did not pay and was not liable to pay taxable wages
         or interstate wages for any part of a financial year satisfies  the
         Commissioner that, by reason of the nature of the person's trade or
         business, the taxable wages and interstate wages, if any,  paid  or
         payable by the person  fluctuate  with  different  periods  of  the
         financial year, the Commissioner may determine that the  person  is
         to be treated for this Part:

         (a)      if the person has conducted  that  trade  or  business  in
             Australia during the whole of  the  financial  year  â  as  an
             employer who pays or is liable to pay taxable wages throughout
             the financial year; or

         (b)      if the person has conducted  that  trade  or  business  in
             Australia during part only of  the  financial  year  â  as  an
             employer who pays or is liable to pay taxable wages throughout
             that part of the financial year.

         Note

         The effect of such a determination is that when the correct  amount
         of payroll tax is calculated (for a tax adjustment provided for  by
         this Part) the employer may receive the benefit of the payroll  tax
         threshold for the period for which the employer is to be treated as
         paying wages, and not just for the period for  which  the  employer
         actually pays wages. Without such a determination, an employer  may
         only receive the benefit of a proportion of  the  threshold  amount
         that is equivalent to the proportion of the  whole  financial  year
         for which the employer actually pays wages.

Part 7      Registration and returns

86    Registration

      (1)   An employer  who  is  not  already  registered  must  apply  for
         registration as an employer under this Act if:

         (a)      during a month the employer pays  or  is  liable  to  pay,
             anywhere, wages of more than the weekly threshold  amount  per
             week that are wholly or partly taxable wages; or

         (b)      the employer is a member of a group the members  of  which
             together during a month pay or are liable  to  pay,  anywhere,
             wages of more than the weekly threshold amount per  week  that
             are wholly or partly taxable wages.

      (1A)  For subsection (1), the weekly threshold amount is to be  worked
         out using the following formula (disregarding any amount in cents):

         [pic]

         where:

         N is the number of days in the financial year.

         TA is the threshold amount for the financial  year  as  defined  in
         Schedule 1, clause 1.

       (2)    The  application  for  registration  is  to  be  made  to  the
         Commissioner in a form and  manner  approved  by  the  Commissioner
         within 21Â days after the end of the month concerned.

      (3)   The Commissioner is to register the  applicant  as  an  employer
         under this Act.

      (4)   The Commissioner may cancel the registration of a person  as  an
         employer if satisfied that the person has ceased to pay or to  have
         a liability to pay wages as described in subsection (1).

      (5)   If the Commissioner cancels the registration of a person  as  an
         employer in any financial year and the person subsequently pays  or
         is liable to pay taxable  wages  during  the  financial  year,  the
         person may, despite the fact the person is not  required  to  apply
         for registration, apply to the Commissioner (in a form  and  manner
         approved by the Commissioner) for registration as an employer,  and
         the Commissioner is then to register  the  person  as  an  employer
         under this Act.

87    Returns

      (1)   Every employer who  is  registered  or  required  to  apply  for
         registration as an employer under this Act must:

         (a)      within 21 days after the end of each month (except June) â
             lodge with the Commissioner a return relating to  that  month;
             and

         (b)      within 21 days after the end of June in each year â  lodge
             with the Commissioner a return relating to that month  and  to
             the adjustment of payroll tax paid or payable by the  employer
             during the financial year ending on the close of that month.

      (2)   The  designated  group  employer  for  a  group  may,  with  the
         approval of the Commissioner, lodge a joint return for this section
         covering specified members of the group (including  the  designated
         group employer).

      (3)   If a joint return is lodged and the return would, if  lodged  by
         a single employer, comply with this section, each of the  employers
         covered by the return is taken to have complied with this section.

107   Pre-1 July 2009 taxable wages that included superannuation
         contributions

      (1)   This section applies if:

         (a)      because of clause 3 of Schedule  1  of  the  old  Act,  an
             employer's taxable wages for a  financial  year  that  started
             before 1 July 2009 (a pre-1 July 2009 financial year) included

         (b)      the employer did not  actually  make  that  superannuation
             contribution until on or after 1 July 2009.

      (2)   The employer may deduct that amount from the employer's  taxable
         wages for a subsequent return period in which  that  superannuation
         contribution is actually made.

      (3)   A superannuation contribution that is alleged by an employer  to

         financial year  must  be  evidenced  to  the  satisfaction  of  the
         Commissioner in the employerâs records for payroll tax purposes.

108   Superannuation contributions relating to pre-1 July 1999 service

         1Â JulyÂ 1999  must  be  evidenced  to  the   satisfaction   of   the
         Commissioner in the employerâs records for payroll tax purposes.

      (3)   In particular, the employerâs records must show  the  manner  of
         calculation of the contribution and any actuarial basis for it.

      (4)   For subsection (3), and any assessment of payroll tax  to  which
         that subsection  is  material,  the  certificate  of  a  fellow  or
         accredited member of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia to the
         effect that the actuarial basis on which an amount is calculated is
         justified is evidence and,  in  the  absence  of  evidence  to  the
         contrary, proof of that fact.

      (5)   If records are  not  kept  as  required  by  this  section,  the
         Commissioner is entitled to assume that a payment of  money  by  an
         employer as a superannuation contribution on or after 1  July  1999
         is an amount  payable  in  respect  of  services  performed  by  an
         employee on or after that day.

         before 1Â JulyÂ 2009 in relation to the old Act or old regulations.

      (2)   A relevant instrument has effect after that date if  it  relates
         to a provision of the old Act or old regulations that continues  to
         have effect after that date because of this Part.

      (3)   If a relevant instrument relates to a provision of the  old  Act
         or old regulations for which there is a corresponding provision  of
         this Act, the relevant instrument has effect after that date as  it
         were made in relation to the corresponding provision of this Act.

Part 11     Transitional matters for amendment Acts

Division 1  Payroll Tax Amendment Act 2010

113   Application

      (1)   Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the amendments made to  this
         Act by the Payroll Tax Amendment  Act  2010  apply  in  respect  of
         taxable wages that are paid or payable on or after 1 July 2009.

      (2)   The amendments made to this Act by  the  Payroll  Tax  Amendment
         Act 2010 are to be applied  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the
         correct amount of payroll tax (within the meaning  of  section  82)
         payable by an employer in respect of the financial year  commencing
         on 1 July 2009 (including in respect of expired months).

      (3)   Section 9 continues to apply in respect of an expired  month  as
         if the amendments made to this Act by  the  Payroll  Tax  Amendment
         ActÂ 2010 had not been made.

      (4)   In this section:

         with the assessment and payment of payroll tax,  in  respect  of  a
         month occurring after June 2009 and before July  2011,  that  would
         have been validly done or omitted to be  done  had  the  amendments
         made to this Act by the Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2011 been
         in force, is taken to have been validly done or omitted.

         grant of a share or an option to an employee that  is  not  an  ESS
         interest as a fringe  benefit  under  PartÂ 3,  Division  2  and  to
         determine the value of those fringe  benefits  in  accordance  with
         those provisions, rather than by reference to Part 3, Division 4.

      (1)   Part 3, Division 4 continues to apply in relation to a share  or
         an option granted before 1 July 2011 that constituted  wages  under
         old section 18, whether or not the grant of  the  share  or  option
         would constitute wages under new section 18, if the relevant day in
         relation to the grant of the share or option is not a day occurring
         before 1 July 2011.

         Example for subsection (1)

         A share granted before 1 July 2011 that  is  not  an  ESS  interest
         continues to be treated as wages under Part 3, Division  4  if  the
         vesting date for the share did not occur before 1 July 2011 and the
         employer did not elect to treat  the  date  of  the  grant  as  the
         relevant day.

      (2)   The assessment amendments apply in respect of any such share  or
         option.

      (3)   Accordingly, the vesting date and the  value  of  the  share  or
         option are to be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  assessment
         amendments.

      (4)   This section does not apply in respect of a share or  an  option
         granted before 1 July 2011 if the  liability  for  payroll  tax  in
         respect of the grant is  determined  in  accordance  with  Part  3,
         Division 2 (as permitted by section 114).

      (5)   In this section:

         assessment amendments means the amendments made by  PartÂ 3  of  the
         Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2011.

         new  section  18  means  section  18  as  amended  by  the  Revenue
         Legislation Amendment Act 2011.

         (e)      the distance travelled by each  such  vehicle  during  the
             relevant 12-week  period,  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the

         (f)      the distance travelled by the  person  in  the  course  of
             business journeys undertaken by means  of  each  such  vehicle

             (the relevant percentage);

         (g)      the odometer readings at the  beginning  and  end  of  the
             financial year for each vehicle provided or maintained by  the

             readings mentioned in paragraph (g);

         (i)      the distance travelled by the  person  in  the  course  of
             business journeys undertaken by means  of  each  such  vehicle

             business kilometres  travelled  during  the  financial  year),
             calculated on the basis that the percentage of  that  distance
             that was travelled by the person in  the  course  of  business
             journeys undertaken by means of each such vehicle  during  the
             financial year is the same as the relevant percentage.

      (2)   For the next  succeeding  4  financial  years  after  the  first
         financial year in which odometer details are recorded in accordance
         with subclause (1), an employer is not required  to  calculate  the
         relevant percentage, or record the details mentioned  in  subclause
         (1)(a) toÂ (f), for the person but is required to record  the  other
         details mentioned in that subclause.

      (3)   Accordingly, for the next succeeding  4  financial  years  after
         the first financial year in which odometer details are recorded  in
         accordance with subclause (1), the number  of  business  kilometres
         travelled during  the  financial  year  is  to  be  calculated  (as
         mentioned in  subclause  (1)(i))  on  the  basis  of  the  relevant
         percentage calculated for the first financial year.

      (4)   Despite subclauses (2) and  (3),  an  employer  is  required  to
         calculate the relevant percentage for a financial year, and  record
         the details mentioned in subclause (1)(a) to (f), if:

         (a)      the Commissioner serves a notice on  the  employer  before
             the commencement  of  a  financial  year  during  that  period
             directing the  employer  to  keep  the  details  mentioned  in
             subclause (1)(a) to (f) for that financial year; or

         (b)      the employer wishes to use the recording method  mentioned
             in this clause for 1 or more additional motor vehicles used by
             the person in any financial year or for any other reason.

      (5)   In a situation mentioned in subclause (4), the  new  record  for
         the  financial  year  replaces  the  relevant  percentage   details
         previously recorded and subclauses (2) and (3) apply in relation to
         the new record for the financial year  as  if  it  were  the  first
         financial year in which odometer details were recorded.

      (6)    An  employer  who  has  adopted  and  employed  the  method  of
         recording mentioned in subclauses (2) and  (3)  for  a  person  for
         4Â successive financial years must, in the next succeeding financial
         year, make a fresh  recording  of  all  the  details  specified  in
         subclauseÂ (1) if the employer intends to continue to use  the  same
         method of recording for the person. Subclauses  (2)  and  (3)  then
         apply in relation to the new record for the financial year as if it
         were the first  financial  year  in  which  odometer  details  were
         recorded.

      (7)   If the odometer of a motor vehicle is replaced  or  recalibrated
         during any period for which its  readings  are  relevant  for  this
         clause, the odometer readings  immediately  before  and  after  the
         replacement or recalibration are to be recorded.

15    Meaning of relevant 12-week period

      (1)   In clause 14, relevant 12-week period means a continuous  period
         of at least 12 weeks, selected by the employer, throughout which  a
         motor vehicle is provided or maintained by a person. If  the  motor
         vehicle is provided or  maintained  for  less  than  12Â weeks,  the
         period must be the entire period for which  the  motor  vehicle  is
         provided or maintained.

      (2)   The period may overlap the start or end of the  financial  year,
         so long as it includes part of the year.

      (3)   If the averaging method is used for 2  or  more  motor  vehicles
         for the same financial year, the odometer readings for those  motor
         vehicles must cover periods that are concurrent.

16    Replacing 1 motor vehicle with another motor vehicle

      (1)   For using the averaging  method,  an  employer  may  nominate  a
         motor vehicle as having replaced another motor vehicle with  effect
         from a day specified in the nomination.

      (2)    After  the  nomination  takes  effect,  the  replacement  motor
         vehicle is treated as the original motor vehicle, and the  original
         motor vehicle is treated as a different motor vehicle. An  employer
         need not repeat for the replacement vehicle the steps already taken
         for the original motor vehicle.

      (3)   An employer  must  record  the  nomination  in  writing  in  the
         financial year in which the nomination takes effect.

      (4)   However, the Commissioner may allow an employer  to  record  the
         nomination at a later time.

17    Changing method of recording

      (1)   An employer may change from using the averaging method to  using
         the continuous recording method with effect from the beginning of a
         financial year if the employer complies with clause 13  in  respect
         of the financial year.

      (2)   An employer may  change  from  using  the  continuous  recording
         method to using the averaging method with effect from the beginning
         of a financial year if the  employer  complies  with  clauseÂ 14  in
         respect of the financial year.

         authorises earlier destruction.

20F   Power to vary or refuse

      (1)   The Commissioner  may  make  an  order  under  subclauseÂ (2)  if
         satisfied that:

         (a)      despite the appearance of an increase  in  the  number  of
             resident employees  after  30Â April  2018,  in  substance,  no
             material change in that number occurred; or

         (b)      the claim, the baseline  count  or  other  information  on
             which a claim is made is not based on an  accurate  reflection
             of  the  employer's  situation  or  the  circumstance  of  the
             employer's employees; or

         (c)      the claim is not justified by any material benefit to  the
             employment of resident employees; or

         (d)      the structure of the employer's business has significantly
             changed since 30Â April 2018.

      (2)   The Commissioner may, by order:

         (a)      vary or refuse, in whole or  in  part,  a  claim  for  the
             exemption; or

         (b)      vary the baseline  count  for  an  employer,  or  allocate
             baseline counts among employers.

20G   Guidelines

      (1)   The Commissioner may issue written guidelines  about  exemptions
         and other matters under this Division.

      (2)   A guideline may be of general or specific application.

      (3)   A claim for an exemption is taken to be a  valid  claim  to  the
         extent that it complies with the guidelines  in  force  under  this
         clause.

      (4)   A guideline does not affect:

         (a)      the exercise by the Commissioner of  a  power  under  this
             Act; or

         (b)      the right of a person to have the Commissioner exercise  a
             power under this Act.

Part 5      Government bodies â special provisions

21    Application of Act to  Government  Business  Divisions  and  statutory
         corporations

      (1)   A Government Business Division is taken to be  an  employer  for
         this Act.

      (2)   A Government Business Division or statutory corporation  (rather
         than the Commissioner for Public Employment) will be  regarded  for
         this Act as the employer of all employees assigned to work in it.

      (3)   If a Government Business Division is  not  a  corporation,  this
         Act applies to it as if it were a corporation.

      (4)   In this clause:

         Government Business Division means an Agency or a part of an Agency
         that:

         (a)      is a Government Business Division as  defined  in  section
             3(1) of the Financial Management Act 1995; and

         (b)      is not excluded by regulation from the operation  of  this
             clause.
