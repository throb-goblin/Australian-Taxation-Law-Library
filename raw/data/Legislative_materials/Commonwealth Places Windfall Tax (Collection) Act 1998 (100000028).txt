 SECT 6  Taxable amount

    (1)    A taxable amount is any amount that meets all the following conditions:

taxpayer) because a State taxing law is wholly or partly invalid
because of paragraph 52(i) of the Constitution;
    (b)    the amount is by way of repayment of an amount paid under the State taxing
law before 6 October 1997;
    (c)    the amount is claimed by the taxpayer from the State, or a court orders
the State to pay the amount to the taxpayer.
    (2)    A taxable amount is reduced by deducting any part of it that a State would
have been liable to repay even if the State taxing law were wholly valid.
Example:    An amount that is repayable solely because of an overpayment by
the taxpayer would be deducted.
