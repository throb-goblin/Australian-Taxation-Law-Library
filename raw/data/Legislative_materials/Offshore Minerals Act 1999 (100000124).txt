Commonwealth-State agreement (the Offshore Constitutional Settlement)
 
 
3 Commonwealth-State agreement (the Offshore Constitutional Settlement)
     (1) The Commonwealth and the States have agreed that:
          (a) Commonwealth offshore mining legislation should be
          limited to the area that is outside State coastal waters,
          and
          (b) the States should share, in the manner provided by the
          Offshore Minerals Act 1994 of the Commonwealth, in the
          administration of the Commonwealth offshore mining
          legislation, and
          (c) State offshore mining legislation should apply to State
          coastal waters beyond the baseline for the territorial sea
          (that is, the first 3 nautical miles of the territorial
          sea), and
          (d) the Commonwealth and the States should try to maintain,
          as far as practicable, common principles, rules and
          practices in regulating and controlling offshore mining
          beyond the baseline of Australia's territorial sea.
          Note 1 : So far as the agreement relates to petroleum, it
          is reflected in this State's legislation by the Petroleum
          (Offshore) Act 1982.
          Note 2 : Some sections of the Commonwealth Act contain
          provisions that are not relevant to the operation of this
          Act. To keep uniformity between this Act and the
          Commonwealth Act the numbers of the sections that are not
          relevant have not been used in the numbering of this Act.
     (2) Other Acts that provide background in this State to the agreement
     (commonly referred to as the "Offshore Constitutional Settlement")
     are:
          (a) the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973, the Coastal
          Waters (State Powers) Act 1980, the Coastal Waters (State
          Title) Act 1980 and the Offshore Petroleum Act 2006 of the
          Commonwealth, and
          (b) the Petroleum (Offshore) Act 1982 of this State.
          Note 1 : The Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973:
               o declares and enacts that the sovereignty in
               respect of the territorial sea and the associated
               airspace, seabed and subsoil is vested in and
               exercisable by the Crown in right of the
               Commonwealth, gives the Governor-General power to
               declare, by Proclamation, the limits of the
               territorial sea, declares and enacts that the
               sovereignty in respect of waters of the sea that
               are on the landward side of the baseline of the
               territorial sea (but not within the limits of a
               State) and in respect of the associated airspace,
               seabed and subsoil is vested in and exercisable
               by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth,
               declares and enacts that the sovereign rights of
               Australia as a coastal State in respect of the
               Continental Shelf of Australia (for the purpose
               of exploring it and exploiting its natural
               resources) are vested in and exercisable by the
               Crown in right of the Commonwealth,
               o gives the Governor-General power to declare, by
               Proclamation, the limits of the Continental Shelf
               of Australia.
     Note 2 : The Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980 was enacted
     following a request from the Parliaments of all the States under
     section 51 (xxxviii) of the Commonwealth Constitution and provides
     that the legislative powers exercisable under the Constitution of
     each State extend to the making of certain laws that would operate
     offshore.
     Note 3 : The Coastal Waters (State Title) Act 1980 vests in each
     State certain property rights in the seabed beneath the coastal
     waters of the State.
     Note 4 : The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006
     of the Commonwealth and the Petroleum (Offshore) Act 1982 of this
     State make provision, based on the agreement referred to in
     subsection (1), for the licensing regime that applies to the
     exploration for and recovery of petroleum in coastal waters and
     offshore areas of this State.

This Act provides for the grant of:
     (a) exploration licences (see Part 2.2), and
     (b) retention licences (see Part 2.3), and
     (c) mining licences (see Part 2.4), and
     (d) works licences (see Part 2.5), and
     (e) special purpose consents (see Part 2.6).
     An exploration licence is designed to cover the exploration phase of
     a project and authorises:
          o exploration, and
          o the recovery of mineral samples.
     A retention licence is designed to ensure the retention of rights
     pending the transition of a project from the exploration phase to the
     commercial mining phase and authorises:
          o exploration, and
          o the recovery of minerals but not as part of a commercial
          mining operation.
     A mining licence is designed to cover the commercial mining phase of
     a project and authorises:
          o exploration, and
          o full commercial recovery.
     A project might make use of any of the following 3 licence
     arrangements:
          o an exploration licence leading to a mining licence,
          o an exploration licence leading to a retention licence and
          then a mining licence,
          o a mining licence (without progressing through an
          exploration/retention licence stage).
     Note 5 : A licence is granted over a particular area (constituted by
     blocks).
     The licence holder may need to carry out engineering or other
     activities outside the licence area. If so, the licence holder or
     someone else must obtain a works licence to carry out those
     activities.
     If a person wants to carry out:
          o a scientific investigation, or
          o a reconnaissance survey, or
          o the collection of only small amounts of minerals,
     in coastal waters, the person must obtain a special purpose consent
     under Part 2.6 to carry out the activity.
     Note 7 : Even though a person has a licence or special purpose
     consent, the person must not interfere unnecessarily with navigation,
     native title, fishing, resource conservation or other activities in
     the area (see section 44).

Grounds for granting retention licence
 
 
145 Grounds for granting retention licence
     (1) The Minister may provisionally grant the retention licence only
     if the Minister is satisfied that:
          (a) the exploration licence holder has identified and
          evaluated a significant mineral deposit in the exploration
          licence area, and
          (b) there are reasonable grounds for the holder not
          applying immediately for a mining licence.
     (2) Without limiting subsection (1), reasonable grounds for not
     applying immediately for a mining licence include the following:
          (a) the need to obtain government approvals (for example,
          relating to environmental protection) before mining
          activities can commence,
          (b) the need to carry out further exploration or evaluation
          in order to establish the commercial viability of a mineral
          deposit found in the licence area,
          (c) the need to develop technologies before mining
          activities can commence,
          (d) the need to arrange finance, or to secure additional
          capital reserves, before mining activities can commence,
          (e) the existence of economic considerations (for example,
          the prevailing condition of the commodity market for the
          minerals concerned) that effectively preclude mining
          activities in the immediate future,
          (f) the existence of political considerations that
          effectively preclude mining activities in the immediate
          future.

               (exploration licence), 135 (retention licence)
               and 195 (mining licence)),

               o mandatory reduction of licence area--special
               permission (see section 104 (exploration
               licence)),

               o variation of conditions (see sections 120
               (exploration licence), 179 (retention licence),
               256 (mining licence) and 306 (works licence)),

               (retention licence), 257 (mining licence) and 307
               (works licence)),

               licence), 189 and 190 (retention licence), 265
               (mining licence) and 313 (works licence)),

               o security requirements (see section 399),
               o approvals of transfers (see section 365).
