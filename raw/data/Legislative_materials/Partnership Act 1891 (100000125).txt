Meaning of firm and firm-name
*** 4 Meaning of firm and firm-name ***
     (1) Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are
     for the purposes of this Act called collectively a
     "firm", and the name under which their business is carried on is
     called the
     "firm-name".
     (2) However, in relation to an incorporated limited partnership, the
     firm-name of the incorporated limited partnership is the name of the
     incorporated limited partnership recorded in the register.
     (3) In this Act, a reference, in relation to an incorporated limited
     partnership, to the incorporated limited partnership or the firm is a
     reference to the incorporated limited partnership as a separate legal
     entity and not to the partners in that partnership.
 
Meaning of partnership
*** 5 Meaning of partnership ***
     (1) Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons
     carrying on a business in common with a view of profit.
     (1A) Partnership includes an incorporated limited partnership.
     (2) However, the relation between members of any company or
     association that isâ
          (a) incorporated under the Corporations Act; or
          (b) formed or incorporated by or in pursuance of any other
          Act of Parliament or letters patent, or Royal Charter;
     is not a partnership within the meaning of this Act.

limited partnerships
*** 5A Application of laws of partnership to limited partnerships and
incorporated limited partnerships ***
     (1) Chapter 2 applies to limited partnerships, subject to chapter 3.
     (2) Except as provided (whether expressly or by necessary
     implication) by this Act or any other Act, the law relating to
     partnership does not apply in relation toâ
          (a) an incorporated limited partnership; or
          (b) the partners in an incorporated limited partnership; or
          (c) the relationship between an incorporated limited
          partnership and its partners.
 
Rules for deciding existence of partnership
*** 6 Rules for deciding existence of partnership ***
     (1) In deciding whether a partnership does or does not exist, regard
     must be had to the following rulesâ
          (a) joint tenancy, tenancy in common, joint property,
          common property, or part ownership does not of itself
          create a partnership as to anything held or owned jointly
          or in common, whether the tenants or owners do or do not
          share any profits made by the use of anything held or owned
          jointly or in common;
          (b) the sharing of gross returns does not of itself create
          a partnership, whether the persons sharing such returns
          have or have not a joint or common right or interest in any
          property from which or from the use of which the returns
          are derived;
          (c) the receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a
          business is prima facie evidence that the person is a
          partner in the business, but the receipt of such a share,
          or of a payment contingent on or varying with the profits
          of a business, does not of itself make the person a partner
          in the business, and in particularâ
               (i) the receipt by a person of a debt or other
               liquidated amount by instalments or otherwise out
               of the accruing profits of a business does not
               itself make the person a partner in the business
               or liable as such;
               (ii) a contract for the remuneration of a servant
               or agent of a person engaged in a business by a
               share of the profits of the business does not
               itself make the servant or agent a partner in the
               business or liable as such;
               (iii) a person being a deceased partnerâs child
               or spouse, and receiving by way of annuity a
               portion of the profits made in the business in
               which the deceased person was a partner, is not
               by reason only of such receipt a partner in the
               business or liable as such;
               (iv) the advance of money by way of loan to a
               person engaged or about to engage in any business
               on a contract with that person that the lender is
               to receive a rate of interest varying with the
               profits, or is to receive a share of the profits
               arising from carrying on the business, does not
               of itself make the lender a partner with the
               person or persons carrying on the business or
               liable as such;
               (v) a person receiving by way of annuity or
               otherwise a portion of the profits of a business
               in consideration of the sale by the person of the
               goodwill of the business is not by reason only of
               such receipt a partner in the business or liable
               as such.
          Noteâ
               See section 82 for an additional rule applying to
               acts preparatory to the registration of
               incorporated limited partnerships.
     (2) A contract mentioned in subsection (1) (c) (iv) must be in
     writing and signed by or on behalf of all the parties to the
     contract.
     (3) This section does not apply in relation to an incorporated
     limited partnership.
 
Postponement of rights of person lending or selling in consideration of share
of profits in case of insolvency
*** 7 Postponement of rights of person lending or selling in consideration of
share of profits in case of insolvency ***
In the event of any person to whom money has been advanced by way of loan upon
such a contract as is mentioned in section 6, or of any buyer of a goodwill in
consideration of a share of the profits of the business, being adjudicated
insolvent, entering into an arrangement to pay the personâs creditors less
than 100 cents in the dollar, or dying in insolvent circumstances, the lender
of the loan is not entitled to recover anything in relation to the personâs
loan, and the seller of the goodwill is not entitled to recover anything in
relation to the share of profits contracted for, until the claims of the other
creditors of the borrower or buyer for valuable consideration in money or
moneyâs worth have been satisfied.

     of the firm and his or her other partners for the purpose of the
     business of the partnership, and the acts of every partner who does
     any act for carrying on in the usual way of business of the kind
     carried on by the firm of which the partner is a member bind the firm

          for the firm in the particular matter; and

     (1) If any member of a firm has died or otherwise ceased to be a
     partner, and the surviving or continuing partners carry on the
     business of the firm with its capital or assets without any final
     settlement of accounts as between the firm and the outgoing partner
     or the partnerâs estate, then, in the absence of any agreement to
     the contrary, the outgoing partner or the partnerâs estate is
     entitled at the option of the partner or the partnerâs
     representatives to such share of the profits made since the
     dissolution as the court may find to be attributable to the use of
     the partnerâs share of the partnership assets, or to interest at
     the rate of 5% per annum on the amount of the partnerâs share of
     the partnership assets.
     (2) However, if by the partnership contract an option is given to
     surviving or continuing partners to purchase the interest of a
     deceased or outgoing partner, and that option is duly exercised, the
     estate of the deceased partner, or the outgoing partner or the
     partnerâs estate, as the case may be, is not entitled to any
     further or other share of profits, but if any partner assuming to act
     in exercise of the option does not in all material respects comply
     with the terms of the option, the partner is liable to account under
     subsection (1).

     they were entitled to share profits;
     (b) the assets of the firm including the sums (if any) contributed by
     the partners to make up losses or deficiencies of capital, are to be
     applied in the following manner and orderâ
