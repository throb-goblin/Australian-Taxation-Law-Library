Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1992

   An Act to effect reforms in the rule of law commonly known as the rule
   against perpetuities, to abolish the rule of law commonly known as the
   rule against accumulations and to repeal the Accumulations Act 1800 and
   for other purposes

   [Royal Assent 7 August 1992]

   Whereas -

     (a) it is a rule of the common law in force in Tasmania in relation
     to dispositions of property by will or by settlement that no
     interest is valid unless it must vest, if at all, not later than 21
     years after some life in being at the creation of the interest; and

     (b) that rule of law is commonly known as the rule against
     perpetuities or the rule against remoteness of vesting; and

     (c) the application of the rule against perpetuities has been found
     to be harsh and capricious and to have defeated the reasonable
     intentions of testators, settlors and other persons dealing with
     property; and

     (d) it is considered that the law should continue to exercise a
     measure of control over dispositions of property, whether by will,
     by settlement or otherwise, to ensure that there are reasonable time
     limits for the vesting of future interests but that it is desirable
     to modify the rigidity of the application of the rule against
     perpetuities; and

     (e) it is expedient to effect other reforms in the law relating to
     accumulations of property and otherwise:

   Be it therefore enacted by His Excellency the Governor of Tasmania, by
   and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and House of
   Assembly, in Parliament assembled, as follows:

     PART 1 - Preliminary

   1.   Short title

     This Act may be cited as the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1992
     .

   2.   Commencement

     This Act commences on a day to be fixed by proclamation.

   3.   Interpretation

     (1)  In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears -

     court includes a person acting judicially;

     disposition includes the conferring or exercise of a power of
     appointment or any other power or authority to dispose of an
     interest in, or a right over, property and any other disposition of
     an interest in, or a right over, property;

     instrument includes a will and any other instrument, whether
     testamentary or not, by which a power of appointment, whether
     general or special is exercised, but does not include an Act of
     Parliament;

     perpetuity period, in the application of the rule against
     perpetuities to a disposition, means -

     (a) a period determined in accordance with this Act as the
     perpetuity period applicable to that disposition; or

     (b) if there is no period so determined, the period applicable to
     that disposition by virtue of the rule against perpetuities;

     power of appointment includes a discretionary power to transfer,
     grant or create a beneficial interest in property without valuable
     consideration;

     property includes any interest in real or personal property and any
     thing in action;

     spouse includes the person with whom a person is, or was at the time
     of his or her death, in a significant relationship, within the
     meaning of the Relationships Act 2003 ;

     the Supreme Court includes a judge of that Court;

     will includes a codicil to a will.

     (2)  For the purposes of the application of the rule against
     perpetuities -

     (a) a disposition contained in a will is taken to be made at the
     death of the testator; and

     (b) a person is taken to be -

     (i) a member of a class if all the conditions identifying a member
     of the class are satisfied in the case of that person; and

     (ii) a potential member of a class if only one or some of those
     conditions are satisfied in the case of that person but there is a
     possibility that the remainder of those conditions will in time be
     satisfied; and

     (c) a person en ventre sa mère but subsequently born alive is
     treated as a person who was alive at the relevant time.

   4.   Application of Act to wills and other instruments

     (1)  Except as provided in this Act -

     (a) this Act, so far as it applies to wills, applies only to wills
     of testators who die after the commencement of this Act; and

     (b) this Act, so far as it applies to instruments other than wills,
     applies only to instruments executed after the commencement of this
     Act.

     (2)  Where a provision of this Act applies to a will or other
     instrument by which a power of appointment is exercised, that
     provision so applies in relation to the exercise of that power,
     whether or not it applies to the will or other instrument creating
     the power.

     (3)  The application of this Act extends to a disposition made
     otherwise than by an instrument as if the disposition had been
     contained in an instrument, other than a will, executed when the
     disposition was made.

     (4)  The application of this Act does not disturb the effect of a
     judgment or an order of a court given or made before the
     commencement of this Act.

   5.   Application of Act and rule against perpetuities to the Crown

     (1)  Except as provided in subsection (2) , this Act and the rule
     against perpetuities bind the Crown not only in right of Tasmania
     but also, so far as the legislative power of Parliament permits, the
     Crown in all its other capacities.

     (2)  Nothing in this Act or in the rule against perpetuities affects
     a disposition of property made by the Crown.

     PART 2 - DETERMINATION OF PERPETUITY PERIOD

   6.   Power to specify perpetuity period

     (1)  Except as provided in this Act, where the instrument by which
     any disposition is made expressly provides that the perpetuity
     period applicable to the disposition under the rule against
     perpetuities is to be such number of years as is specified in the
     instrument, the perpetuity period, instead of being of any other
     duration, is the period so specified or a period of 80 years,
     whichever is the lesser period, from the date on which the
     disposition takes effect.

     (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a disposition made
     in the exercise of a special power of appointment but, if a period
     is specified under subsection (1) in the instrument creating the
     power, that period applies in relation to any disposition under that
     power as it applies in relation to the power itself.

     (3)  If no period of years is specified in an instrument by which a
     disposition is made as the perpetuity period applicable to the
     disposition but a date certain is specified in the instrument as the
     date on which the disposition is to vest, the instrument is taken,
     for the purposes of this section, to specify as the perpetuity
     period applicable to the disposition a number of years equal to the
     number of years from the date of the taking effect of the instrument
     to the specified vesting date.

     (4)  If no perpetuity period is applicable to a disposition by
     virtue of this section, the perpetuity period is to be determined by
     the rule against perpetuities as affected by this Act.

   7.   Unborn husband or wife

     The spouse of a deceased person who is a life in being for the
     purposes of the rule against perpetuities is treated as a life in
     being for the purpose of the application of that rule to-

     (a) a disposition in favour of that spouse; and

     (b) a disposition in favour of-

     (i) a charity that attains; or

     (ii) a person who attains; or

     (iii) a class the members of which attain-

     according to the terms of the disposition, a vested interest on or
     after-

     (iv) the death of the survivor of a person who is a life in being
     and his or her spouse; or

     (v) the death of his or her spouse; or

     (vi) the happening of any contingency during the lifetime of his or
     her spouse.

     PART 3 - RULES TO BE APPLIED IN DETERMINING VALIDITY OF INTERESTS

   8.   Powers of appointment

     (1)  For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, a power of
     appointment is to be treated as a special power unless -

     (a) in the instrument creating the power it is expressed to be
     exercisable by one person only; and

     (b) the power could, at all times during its currency when that
     person is of full age and capacity, be exercised by him or her so as
     immediately to transfer to or otherwise vest in himself or herself
     the whole of the interest governed by the power without the consent
     of any other person or compliance with any other condition that is
     not a formal condition relating only to the mode of exercise of the
     power.

     (2)  For the purpose of determining whether a disposition made under
     a power of appointment exercisable by will only is void for
     remoteness, the power is treated as a general power where it would
     have fallen to be so treated if exercisable by deed.

   9.   "Wait and see" rule

     (1)  Where, but for this section and section 11 , a disposition
     would be void on the ground that the interest disposed of might not
     become vested until too remote a time, the disposition is treated
     until such time, if any, as it is established that the vesting must
     occur, if at all, after the perpetuity period as if the disposition
     were not subject to the rule against perpetuities.

     (2)  Where it is established that a vesting must occur after the
     perpetuity period as mentioned in subsection (1) , nothing in that
     subsection affects the validity of anything previously done in
     relation to the interest disposed of by way of advancement,
     application of intermediate income or otherwise.

     (3)  Where, but for this section and section 11 , a disposition
     consisting of the conferring of a general power of appointment would
     be void on the ground that the power might not become exercisable
     until too remote a time, the disposition is treated as if it were
     not subject to the rule against perpetuities until such time, if
     any, as it is established that the power will not be exercisable
     within the perpetuity period.

     (4)  Where, but for this section and section 11 , a disposition
     consisting of the conferring of a power or right that is not an
     option to which section 15 (2) or (4) refers would be void on the
     ground that the power or right might be exercised at too remote a
     time, the disposition is to be treated -

     (a) with regard to any exercise of the power or right within the
     perpetuity period, as if it were not subject to the rule against
     perpetuities; and

     (b) subject to this section and section 11 , as void for remoteness
     only if and so far as the power or right is not fully exercised
     within that period.

     (5)  In the application of this section to a disposition where the
     duration of the perpetuity period is not determined by virtue of
     section 6 or 15 , that period is to be determined as follows:

     (a) where it is provided in the instrument making the disposition
     that only a particular person is, or only particular persons are, to
     be treated as the measuring life or lives, the duration of the
     perpetuity period is to be determined by reference to his or her
     life or their lives and no other lives;

     (b) where any persons referred to in subsection (6) as measuring
     lives are individuals in being and ascertainable at the commencement
     of the perpetuity period, the duration of the perpetuity period is
     to be determined by reference to their lives and no other lives, but
     so that the lives of any description of persons referred to in that
     subsection are to be disregarded if the number of persons of that
     description is such as to render it impracticable to ascertain the
     date of death of the survivor;

     (c) where there are no such measuring lives, the perpetuity period
     is 21 years.

     (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5) , the persons who are to be
     treated as measuring lives are as follows:

     (a) a person who is specified in the instrument making the
     disposition as being a measuring life for the purposes of the
     disposition;

     (b) the person or persons by whom the disposition was made;

     (c) a person to whom or in whose favour the disposition was made,
     namely -

     (i) in the case of a disposition to a class of persons, any member
     or potential member of the class; or

     (ii) in the case of an individual disposition to a person taking
     only on certain conditions being satisfied, a person as to whom some
     of the conditions are satisfied and the other conditions may in time
     be satisfied; or

     (iii) in the case of a disposition made in exercise of a special
     power of appointment -

     (A) the donee of the power; or

     (B) where the power is exercisable in favour of members of a class,
     a member or potential member of the class; or

     (C) where the power is exercisable in favour of one person only,
     that person or, where the object of the power is ascertainable only
     on certain conditions being satisfied, a person in respect of whom
     some of the conditions are satisfied and the other conditions may in
     time be satisfied; or

     (iv) in the case of a disposition consisting of the conferring of a
     power or right, a person on whom the power or right is conferred;

     (d) a spouse who is treated as a life in being by virtue of section
     7 ;

     (e) a person having a child or grandchild referred to in paragraph
     (c) or any of whose children or grandchildren, if subsequently born,
     would by virtue of his or her descent fall within that paragraph;

     (f) where a disposition is expressly limited to take effect -

     (i) during the life of a person; or

     (ii) on the death of a person, whether as an individual or as a
     survivor of a group of persons, or on the failure or determination
     of his or her prior interest -

     that person;

     (g) a parent or grandparent of a person referred to in paragraph (f)
     .

   10.   Presumptions and evidence as to future parenthood

     (1)  Where there arises, in the application of the rule against
     perpetuities to a disposition or in determining the right of a
     person to put an end to a trust or an accumulation, a question that
     depends on the capacity of a person to procreate a child at a future
     time -

     (a) it is presumed, subject to paragraph (b) , that -

     (i) a male person can procreate a child at the age of 12 years or
     over but not under that age; and

     (ii) a female person can procreate a child at the age of 12 years or
     over but not under that age or over the age of 55 years; but

     (b) in the case of a living person, evidence may be given in any
     proceedings to show that he or she will, or will not, be capable of
     procreating a child at the time in question.

     (2)  Where, by virtue of subsection (1) , a person is treated as
     incapable of procreating a child at a particular time and he or she
     in fact procreates a child at that time, the Supreme Court may make
     such order as it thinks fit for placing the persons interested in
     the property comprised in a disposition, so far as may be just, in
     the position they would have held if subsection (1) were not
     applicable to the disposition, trust or accumulation concerned.

     (3)  Subject to an order made under subsection (2) , where in any
     proceedings relating to a disposition, a person is treated by virtue
     of subsection (1) as capable or incapable of procreating a child at
     a particular time, that person is to be so treated for the purpose
     of any question that may arise in the application of the rule
     against perpetuities to the same disposition in any subsequent
     proceedings.

     (4)  This section, except subsection (1) (b) , has effect in
     relation to the possibility that a person may at any time become a
     parent of another person by adoption or the operation of any law,
     whether in force in Tasmania or not.

   11.   Reduction of age and exclusion of class members to avoid
   remoteness

     (1)  Where a disposition is limited by reference to the attainment
     by any person or persons of a specified age exceeding 21 years and
     it is apparent at the time the disposition is made or becomes
     apparent at a subsequent time -

     (a) that the disposition would, but for this section, be void for
     remoteness; and

     (b) that it would not be so void if the specified age had been 21
     years -

     the disposition is to be treated for all purposes as if, instead of
     being limited by reference to the age in fact specified, it had been
     limited by reference to the age nearest to that age that would, if
     specified instead, have prevented the disposition from being void
     for remoteness.

     (2)  Where, in the case of any disposition, different ages exceeding
     21 years are specified in relation to different persons -

     (a) the reference in subsection (1) (b) to the specified age is to
     be construed as a reference to all the specified ages; and

     (b) subsection (1) operates to reduce each such age so far as is
     necessary to save the disposition from being void for remoteness.

     (3)  Where the inclusion of -

     (a) a person who is a potential member of a class; or

     (b) an unborn person who at birth would become a member or potential
     member of a class -

     would prevent this section from operating to save a disposition from
     being void for remoteness, that person is to be treated as excluded
     from the class for all the purposes of the disposition.

     (4)  Where, in the case of a disposition to which subsection (3)
     does not apply, it is apparent at the time the disposition is made
     or becomes apparent at a subsequent time that, but for this
     subsection, the inclusion of -

     (a) a person who is a potential member of a class; or

     (b) an unborn person who at birth could become a member or potential
     member of a class -

     would cause the disposition to be treated as void for remoteness,
     that person, unless his or her exclusion would exhaust the class, is
     to be treated for all the purposes of the disposition as excluded
     from the class.

     (5)  Where this section has effect in relation to a disposition to
     which section 9 applies, the operation of this section does not
     affect the validity of any thing previously done in relation to the
     interest disposed of by way of advancement, application of
     intermediate income or otherwise.

   12.   Dependent dispositions

     (1)  A disposition that complies with the rule against perpetuities
     is not invalidated solely by reason that it is preceded by an
     invalid disposition, whether or not it expressly or by implication
     takes effect after, or subject to, or is dependent on, that invalid
     disposition.

     (2)  Where a disposition is invalid by virtue of the rule against
     perpetuities, any subsequent valid disposition is accelerated.

   13.   Mitigation of rule of remorseless construction

     (1)  Where a court construes a will or other instrument, whether
     made before or after the commencement of this Act, and the will or
     instrument makes a disposition of any property, the court may have
     regard to the fact that, while under one possible construction the
     disposition would or might be void by virtue of the rule against
     perpetuities, under another possible construction it would or might
     be valid.

     (2)  In considering which of those constructions is to be preferred,
     the court may take into account that the testator would probably
     have intended the construction under which the disposition would be
     valid.

     (3)  In the application of this section a court must not -

     (a) render any trustee or other person liable for any acts done
     before the commencement of this Act for which the trustee or person
     would not have been liable if this Act had not been passed; or

     (b) enable any trustee or person to recover any money distributed or
     paid under any trust, if the trustee or person could not have
     recovered that money apart from subsection (1) .

     PART 4 - APPLICABILITY OF RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES

   14.   Administrative powers of trustees

     (1)  The rule against perpetuities -

     (a) does not operate, and is taken never to have operated, to
     invalidate a power conferred on trustees or other persons to sell,
     lease, exchange or otherwise dispose of any property for full
     consideration, or to do any other act in the administration of any
     property; and

     (b) does not prevent, and is taken never to have prevented, the
     payment to trustees or other persons of reasonable remuneration for
     their services.

     (2)  Subsection (1) does not -

     (a) render any trustee or other person liable for any acts done
     before the commencement of this Act for which the trustee or person
     would not have been liable if this Act had not been passed; or

     (b) enable any trustee or person to recover any money distributed or
     paid under any trust if the trustee or person could not have
     recovered that money apart from that subsection.

     (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1) , the administration of
     trust property is taken not to include a power to appoint, pay,
     transfer, advance, apply, distribute or otherwise deal with trust
     property in or towards satisfaction of -

     (a) the interest of a beneficiary under the trust; or

     (b) a purpose of the trust.

   15.   Options

     (1)  The rule against perpetuities does not apply to a disposition
     consisting of the conferring of an option to acquire for valuable
     consideration an interest reverting to the lessor on the termination
     of a lease of land if -

     (a) the option is exercisable only by the lessee or the lessee's
     successors in title; and

     (b) it ceases to be exercisable at or before the expiration of one
     year following the termination of the lease.

     (2)  An option to acquire an interest in land that is not an option
     to which subsection (1) refers is void and a right of pre-emption in
     respect of land is void if the option or right according to its
     terms is, or may be, exercisable -

     (a) in the case of an instrument that provides for the price to be
     regulated by reference to the market price of the land at the date
     of the exercise of the option or right, at a date more than 21 years
     after the date of its grant; or

     (b) in the case of any other instrument, at a date more than 6 years
     after the date of its grant.

     (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to an option or right of
     pre-emption conferred by a will and nothing in that subsection
     affects an option for renewal of a lease or a right to purchase the
     reversion, whether by way of option or pre-emption, contained in a
     lease.

     (4)  An option to acquire an interest in personal property that is
     capable of being enforced by specific performance is void and a
     right of pre-emption in respect of any such property is void if the
     option or right according to its terms is, or may be, exercisable at
     a date more than 21 years after the date of its grant.

     (5)  An option or right that is void by virtue of subsection (2) or
     (4) is not exercisable by any person and no remedy lies in contract
     or otherwise for giving effect to it or making restitution for its
     lack of effect.

     (6)  For the purposes of this section, a reference to a lease
     includes a reference to an agreement for a lease, a tenancy
     agreement, a licence or some other written document for, or relating
     to, occupancy.

   16.   Determinable interests

     (1)  The rule against perpetuities applies and is taken always to
     have applied to a possibility of reverter in land on the
     determination of a determinable fee simple, and in any such case, if
     the fee simple does not determine within the perpetuity period, it
     continues after that period as a fee simple absolute.

     (2)  The rule against perpetuities applies and is taken always to
     have applied to a possibility of a resulting trust on the
     determination of any other determinable interest in property, and in
     any such case, if that determinable interest does not determine
     within the perpetuity period, it continues as an absolute interest.

     (3)  The rule against perpetuities applies and, except as provided
     by subsection (4) , is taken always to have applied to a right of
     entry for conditions broken, the exercise of which may determine a
     fee simple subject to a condition subsequent and to an equivalent
     right in the case of property other than land, and in any such case,
     if the right of entry or other right is not exercised within the
     perpetuity period -

     (a) the fee simple continues after that period as an absolute
     interest; and

     (b) any such other interest in property continues free from the
     condition.

     (4)  Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a right arising
     from a disposition made on or after the commencement of the
     Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1962 and before the
     commencement of this Act.

     (5)  This section applies whether the determinable or conditional
     disposition is charitable or not, but the rule against perpetuities
     does not apply to a gift over from one charity to another charity.

     (6)  Where a disposition is subject to -

     (a) a provision that causes an interest to which subsection (1) or
     (2) applies to be determinable; or

     (b) a condition subsequent giving rise on breach to a right of
     re-entry or an equivalent right in the case of property other than
     land; or

     (c) an exception or reservation -

     the disposition is treated, for the purposes of this Act, as
     including a separate disposition of any rights arising by virtue of
     the provision, condition subsequent, exception or reservation.

   17.   Superannuation funds and other benefits

     (1)  The rule against perpetuities does not apply and is taken never
     to have applied so as to render void -

     (a) a trust or fund established for the purpose of making provision
     for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2) for -

     (i) the servants or employees of any employer; or

     (ii) the spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, dependants or
     legal personal representatives of any such servants or employees; or

     (iii) any persons duly selected or nominated for that purpose by any
     such servants or employees pursuant to the provisions of that trust
     or fund; or

     (b) a trust or fund established for the purpose of making provision
     for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2) for -

     PART 5 - RULES OTHER THAN THE RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES

   21.   Abolition of the double possibility rule and the cy-près doctrine

     (1)  The rule of law prohibiting the limitation after a life
     interest to an unborn person of an interest in land to the unborn
     child or other issue of an unborn person is abolished but without
     prejudice to any other rule relating to perpetuities.

     (2)  The doctrine of cy-près or approximation relating to a
     disposition of a kind referred to in subsection (1) , when contained
     in a will, is abolished.

     created by an instrument coming into operation after the
     commencement of this Act.

   22.   Accumulation of income

     (1)  Where property is settled or disposed of so that the income of
     the property may be, or is directed to be, accumulated wholly or in
     part, the power or direction to accumulate that income is valid only
     if the disposition of the accumulated income is, or may be, valid.

     his or her benefit; or

     (3)  This section does not apply where property is settled on trusts
     for a general charitable intent.

     PART 6 - APPLICATIONS TO THE SUPREME COURT

   23.   Power to apply to Supreme Court for declaration as to validity,
   &c.

     (1)  An executor or trustee of property, or a person interested
     under, or in the invalidity of, a disposition of property, whether
     made before or after the commencement of this Act, may at any time
     apply to the Supreme Court for a declaration as to the validity, in
     respect of the rule against perpetuities, of a disposition of that
     property.

     (2)  The Supreme Court may, on an application under subsection (1) ,
     make a declaration, having regard to facts existing and events that
     have occurred at the time the declaration is made, as to the
     validity or otherwise of the disposition in respect of which the
     application is made.

     (3)  The Supreme Court must not make a declaration under subsection
     (2) in respect of a disposition the validity of which cannot be
     determined at the time when the Court is asked to make the
     declaration.

     (4)  If the Supreme Court refuses to make a declaration under
     subsection (2) relating to a disposition, the Court may give such
     directions as it thinks fit on any of the following matters:

     (a) the construction of the instrument by which the disposition is
     made;

     (b) the determination of a person who is a measuring life for the
     purposes of the disposition;

     (c) whether a person who is a measuring life is to be presumed dead;

     (d) whether, before the determination of the perpetuity period
     applicable to the disposition, an interest is to be treated as
     incapable of vesting during that period;

     (e) any other matter on which an application could properly be made
     to the Court apart from this Act.

   24.   Cy-près modification in certain cases

     (1)  Subject to this section, where -

     (a) the Supreme Court has, under section 23 , declared a disposition
     of property to be invalid; or

     (b) it appears to the Court that a disposition, whether made before
     or after the commencement of this Act, would be invalid solely on
     the ground that it conflicts with the rule against perpetuities -

     and the general intentions originally governing the disposition can
     be ascertained, the Supreme Court must reform the disposition so as
     to give effect as far as possible to those general intentions within
     the limits permitted under the rule against perpetuities as affected
     by this Act.

     (2)  A disposition of property that was made before the commencement
     of this Act is not to be reformed under subsection (1) -

     (a) if the disposition has been declared invalid before that
     commencement by an order or judgment made or given in legal
     proceedings; or

     (b) if any property comprised in the disposition has, before that
     commencement, been paid or transferred to, or applied for the
     benefit of, or set apart for, a person entitled by reason of the
     invalidity of the disposition; or

     (c) so as to prejudice a person who has, before that commencement,
     reasonably altered his or her position in reliance on the invalidity
     of the disposition if, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, having
     regard to all possible implications in respect of other persons, it
     is inequitable to reform the disposition wholly or in part.

     (3)  In hearing an application to reform a disposition under this
     section, the Supreme Court -

     (a) may admit extrinsic evidence of the general intentions
     originally governing the disposition and must apply liberal rules of
     construction for the purpose of ascertaining them; and

     (b) must have no regard to the rights of any person other than -

     (i) a person born or en ventre sa mère when the disposition was
     made; and

     (ii) a person entitled on the death of any such person -

     and in reforming the disposition the Supreme Court may specify the
     perpetuity period in accordance with section 6 .

     (4)  An application for reformation under this section may be made
     by -

     (a) a trustee of any property comprised in the disposition; or

     (b) the settlor or the settlor's personal representative; or

     (c) a person having an interest, whether vested or contingent, under
     the disposition or the personal representative of that person to
     whom the interest passes.

     (5)  Where a trustee of property comprised in a disposition becomes
     aware that the disposition requires to be reformed under subsection
     (1) , the trustee has a duty to make an application under this
     section.

     (6)  A disposition that has been reformed under this section -

     (a) is valid notwithstanding that it would have been invalid under
     any rule of law or construction if it had been effected in any other
     way; and

     (b) is to be construed as if it had not been effected under this
     section.

   25.   Vesting orders arising from resulting trusts

     (1)  Where the Supreme Court has refused to reform a disposition
     under section 24 , the Supreme Court may, if satisfied that the
     person who made the disposition, or his or her personal
     representative, has become entitled under a resulting trust, make an
     order vesting the property comprised in the disposition absolutely
     in that person or, if that person has died, in his or her personal
     representative on the trusts of the estate of the deceased person.

     (2)  In the case of a disposition referred to in subsection (1) ,
     where a person other than a donor of property that was given to the
     trustee on trust, has sold other property to the trustee, or has
     assisted the trustee, by loan, guarantee or otherwise, to acquire
     other property -

     (a) the power of the Supreme Court to make a vesting order under
     that subsection is restricted to so much of the property comprised
     in the disposition as was given by that donor or fairly attributable
     to the donor's gift; and

     (b) the Court may make such order as it considers just and equitable
     regarding the remainder of the property comprised in the
     disposition.

     (3)  An application for a vesting order under this section in
     respect of property comprised in a disposition may be made by -

     (a) a trustee of that property; or

     (b) a vendor of that property to that trustee or the personal
     representative of any such vendor; or

     (c) a person who assisted that trustee, by loan, guarantee or
     otherwise, to acquire that property or the personal representative
     of that person.
