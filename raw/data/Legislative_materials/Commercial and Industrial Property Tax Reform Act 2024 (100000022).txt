COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY TAX REFORM ACT 2024
- SECT 10
Aggregation of interests acquired under qualifying dutiable transactions 

S. 10(1)
amended by No. 48/2025 s. 6.

     (1)     For the purposes of section 8(1)(c)(ii), an interest in land
obtained by a person under a qualifying dutiable transaction must be aggregated
with another interest in the land obtained under another qualifying dutiable
transaction if&#8212;

         (a)     those dutiable transactions are aggregated under section 24 of
the Duties Act 2000; or

         (b)     the dutiable transactions occur within a 3 year period and
either&#8212;

or

               (ii)     the transferees under the dutiable transactions are associated
persons. 

Example

Person A is the transferee under a transfer of land occurring on 1 July

transaction A).  Person B is the transferee under a transfer of land
occurring on 1 July 2026 relating to a 15% interest in the same land
(qualifying dutiable transaction B).  Persons A and B are
associated persons.  The interests they acquired in the land are aggregated and
together amount to a qualifying interest.  This means qualifying dutiable
transaction B is the entry transaction for the land.  

     (2)     For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a person is not an associated
person of another person if the Commissioner is satisfied that the interests of
the persons&#8212;

         (a)     were acquired, and will be used, independently; and

         (b)     were not acquired, and will not be used, for a common
purpose.

         (a)     the transaction is a relevant acquisition; and

         (b)     at the time of the relevant acquisition, the landholder holds an
interest in land described in section 10(1)(a) of the Duties

Act 2000; and

         (d)     the relevant acquisition is not an eligible transaction within the
meaning of section 250A of the Duties Act 2000.

     (2)     However, a relevant acquisition is not a qualifying landholder
transaction if the relevant acquisition is made pursuant to an agreement or
arrangement that was entered into before the commencement of this Act.

     (3)     For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), the interest the
landholder holds in land is to be determined in accordance with Part 2 of
Chapter 3 of the Duties Act 2000. 

     (4)     An interest in land is to be disregarded for the purposes of
subsection (1)(b) if the Commissioner determines under section 89I of
the Duties Act 2000 that the land was not, at the time of the
relevant acquisition, a land holding of the landholder.  

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY TAX REFORM ACT 2024
- SECT 12
Determination of interest acquired under qualifying landholder transaction 

     (1)     The interest in land that a person is taken to have acquired under a qualifying landholder 
transaction is the interest calculated in accordance with the following
formula&#8212;

where&#8212;

          A     is the interest acquired in the landholder under the qualifying
landholder transaction on which duty is chargeable under Part 2 of
Chapter 3 of the Duties Act 2000;

     B     is the interest the landholder holds in the land at the time the relevant acquisition is made. 

     (2)     For the purposes of the variable B, the interest the landholder
holds in land is to be determined in accordance with Part 2 of
Chapter 3 of the Duties Act 2000. 

     (3)     If, at the time of a relevant acquisition described in
section 11(1), a landholder holds more than one interest in land described
in section 11(1)(b), the relevant acquisition is taken to be a separate
qualifying landholder transaction in respect of each interest in land held by
the landholder.  

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY TAX REFORM ACT 2024
- SECT 13
Aggregation of interests acquired under qualifying landholder transactions 

S. 13(1)
amended by No. 48/2025 s. 8.

     (1)     For the purposes of section 8(1)(c)(ii), an interest in land
obtained by a person under a qualifying landholder transaction must be
aggregated with another interest in the land obtained under another qualifying
landholder transaction if&#8212;

         (a)     the qualifying landholder transactions occur within a 3 year
period; and

         (b)     under each qualifying landholder transaction, a relevant acquisition
is made in the same landholder; and

         (c)     the relevant acquisitions in the landholder are made by the same
person or associated persons. 

Example

Person A obtains a 20% interest in land under a qualifying landholder
transaction occurring on 1 December 2024 (qualifying landholder
transaction A).  Person B obtains a 40% interest in the land under a
qualifying landholder transaction occurring on 1 July 2026
(qualifying landholder transaction B).  Person A and Person B
are associated persons.  The interests Persons A and B acquired in the land are
aggregated and together amount to a qualifying interest.  This means qualifying
landholder transaction B is the entry transaction for the land.  

     (2)     For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a person is not an associated
person of another person if the Commissioner is satisfied that the interests of
the persons&#8212;

         (a)     were acquired, and will be used, independently; and

         (b)     were not acquired, and will not be used, for a common
purpose.

     (3)     Subsection (2) does not apply if the persons are associated persons
because they are related bodies corporate.

         (a)     tax reform scheme land is consolidated with any of the
following&#8212;

               (i)     land that has not entered the tax reform scheme;

land.

     (2)     However, tax reform scheme land is taken to no longer be tax reform
scheme land if&#8212;

         (a)     the land is consolidated with land that has not entered the tax reform
scheme; and

INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984
(ILA)

Style changes

Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out
in Schedule 1 to that Act.

References to ILA s. 39B

Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended by
the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section or
clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the insertion of
the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or
clause.

Interpretation

As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the
following effects:

&#8226;     Headings

All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed before 1
January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that
Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule;
sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms. 
See section 36(1A)(2A).

&#8226;     Examples, diagrams or notes

All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on
or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).

&#8226;     Punctuation

All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January
2001 forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was
passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B).

&#8226;     Provision numbers

All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  See
section 36(3C).

&#8226;     Location of "legislative items"

A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13
October 2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to
be at the foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another
legislative item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at
the foot of a provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items
will be regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section
36B.

&#8226;     Other material

Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and other
material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.  See
section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
