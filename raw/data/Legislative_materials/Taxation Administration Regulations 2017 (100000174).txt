INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984
(ILA)

Style changes

Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out
in Schedule 1 to that Act.

References to ILA s. 39B

Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which
provides that where an undivided regulation, rule or clause of a Schedule is
amended by the insertion of one or more subregulations, subrules or subclauses
the original regulation, rule or clause becomes subregulation, subrule or
subclause (1) and is amended by the insertion of the expression "(1)" at
the beginning of the original regulation, rule or clause.

Interpretation

As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the
following effects:

&#8226;     Headings

All headings included in a Statutory Rule which is made on or after 1
January 2001 form part of that Statutory Rule.  Any heading inserted in a
Statutory Rule which was made before 1 January 2001, by a Statutory Rule made on
or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Statutory Rule. This includes
headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule; Orders; Parts into
which an Order is divided; clauses; regulations; rules; items; tables; columns;
examples; diagrams; notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A)(2B).

&#8226;     Examples, diagrams or notes

All examples, diagrams or notes included in a Statutory Rule which is made
on or after 1 January 2001 form part of that Statutory Rule.  Any examples,
diagrams or notes inserted in a Statutory Rule which was made before
1 January 2001, by a Statutory Rule made on or after 1 January 2001, form
part of that Statutory Rule.  See section 36(3A).

&#8226;     Punctuation

All punctuation included in a Statutory Rule which is made on or after
1 January 2001 forms part of that Statutory Rule.  Any punctuation inserted
in a Statutory Rule which was made before 1 January 2001, by a Statutory Rule
made on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Statutory Rule. See
section 36(3B).

&#8226;     Provision numbers

All provision numbers included in a Statutory Rule form part of that
Statutory Rule, whether inserted in the Statutory Rule before, on or after 1
January 2001.  Provision numbers include regulation numbers, rule numbers,
subregulation numbers, subrule numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  See
section 36(3C).

&#8226;     Location of "legislative items"

A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13
October 2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of a Statutory Rule is
taken to be at the foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by
another legislative item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a
penalty at the foot of a provision is followed by a note, both of these
legislative items will be regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See
section 36B.

&#8226;     Other material

Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and other
material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of a Statutory Rule.  See
section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
