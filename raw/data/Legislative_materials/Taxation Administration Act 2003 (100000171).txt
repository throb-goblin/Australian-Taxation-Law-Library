                           Division 1 -- Assessments

13. Assessments

(1) An assessment is a determination --
(a) of the amount of tax payable under a taxation Act or of a portion of such
an amount; or
(b) that no tax is payable; or
(c) that a person is liable to pay tax or is exempt from liability to pay tax;
or

tax.
(2) An assessment may be made in relation to any one or more, or all, of the
components of the tax payable by a taxpayer.
(3) The receipt by the Commissioner of an amount as payment of tax does not
constitute an assessment of tax liability.
[Section 13 amended: No. 10 of 2013 s. 11.]

14. Self-assessments

A self-assessment is --
(a) an assessment made by the taxpayer in a return under a taxation Act; or

accordance with a special tax return arrangement.

15. Official assessments

(1) An official assessment is an assessment made by the Commissioner.
(2) The Commissioner must make an official assessment of the tax payable by a
person --
(a) if the person is or is likely to be liable to pay tax, but is not required
to make a self-assessment; or
(b) when a taxation Act specifically requires the Commissioner to do so.
(3) The Commissioner may make an official assessment on his or her own
initiative, and may do so even if the taxpayer is required to make, or has
made, a self-assessment.
(4) The Commissioner may make an official assessment in any other circumstances
at the taxpayer's request.

16A. Interim assessments

(1) The Commissioner may make an assessment (an interim assessment) of a
portion of the tax payable by a person when a taxation Act specifically
authorises the Commissioner to do so.
(2) The Commissioner can make only one interim assessment of the tax payable.
(3) The interim assessment must be followed by a complete assessment, which the
Commissioner must make when the Commissioner --
(a) has sufficient information to make such an assessment; or
(b) makes a compromise agreement.
(4) An interim assessment does not bind the Commissioner in relation to an
assessment made following the interim assessment.
(5) The complete assessment following the interim assessment supersedes the
interim assessment but does not affect any liability for --
(a) penalty tax arising out of the interim assessment; or
(b) interest payable under a tax payment arrangement.
(6) The complete assessment following the interim assessment is not a
reassessment of the interim assessment.
(7) The Commissioner is not prevented from making or enforcing an interim
assessment by --
(a) the Commissioner having already made an assessment that is not a complete
assessment, that is, an assessment that a person is liable to pay tax or that
an instrument, event or transaction is liable to tax; or
(b) a person making an objection or taking review proceedings in relation to an
assessment referred to in paragraph (a).
(8) No action can be brought in any court or tribunal to compel the
Commissioner to make an interim assessment.
[Section 16A inserted: No. 10 of 2013 s. 12.]

16. Reassessments

(1) The Commissioner must make a reassessment --
(a) if specifically required to do so under a taxation Act; or
(b) if specifically required to do so under a direction given in the course of
review proceedings; or
(c) if a taxation Act provides for a rebate or refund of tax in particular
circumstances, and the circumstances were not taken into account when the
previous assessment was made.
(2) Subject to subsection (5), the Commissioner may also make a reassessment --
(a) on his or her own initiative, if it appears that a previous assessment is
or may be incorrect for any reason; or
(b) on the application of the taxpayer.
(3A) Despite subsections (1) and (2), the Commissioner cannot make a
reassessment in relation to an interim assessment unless specifically required
to do so by section 39(1) or a direction given in the course of review
proceedings.
(3B) A reference in this Act to an assessment following an interim assessment
does not include a reference to a reassessment of an interim assessment.
(3) A reassessment may be made whether or not any amount of tax has been paid
on the previous assessment.
(4) A reassessment may consolidate 2 or more separate assessments into a single
assessment.
(5) If an assessment is based on a particular interpretation of the applicable
law or a particular practice of the Commissioner that was generally applied to
assessments of that kind when the assessment was made, then the Commissioner
cannot make a reassessment based on the ground that the interpretation or
practice is or was erroneous.
[Section 16 amended: No. 55 of 2004 s. 1165; No. 10 of 2013 s. 13.]

17. Time limits on reassessments

(1) A taxpayer is not entitled to apply for a reassessment more than 5 years
after the original assessment was made.
(2) The Commissioner may make a reassessment at any time after the previous
assessment was made if --
(a) the Commissioner has been directed, in the course of review proceedings, to
make the reassessment; or
(b) there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there has been an evasion
of tax, or that the previous assessment was made on the basis of false or
misleading information.
(3) The Commissioner may make a reassessment of the amount of pay-roll tax or
betting tax payable on an original assessment that was made in or in relation
to any of the 5 financial years that precede the financial year in which the
reassessment is made.
(4) However, in any other circumstances the Commissioner may only make a
reassessment within 5 years after the date of the original assessment or on an
application made within 5 years after the date of the original assessment.
[Section 17 amended: No. 55 of 2004 s. 1166; No. 37 of 2018 s. 46.]

18. Effect of reassessment

(1) A reassessment of an interim assessment or an original assessment
supersedes the assessment and any earlier reassessment.
(2) A reassessment may increase or decrease the amount originally assessed.
(3) If tax payable on --
(a) an instrument; or
(b) a transaction or event that an instrument effects or records,
is reassessed, and the instrument or a duplicate or copy of it is produced to
the Commissioner, the Commissioner may endorse it to indicate the amount of tax
(if any) payable under the reassessment and the amount of tax paid (if any),
(but the reassessment takes effect irrespective of it being so endorsed).
(4) A reassessment does not invalidate proceedings for the recovery of tax, but
the amount to be recovered is to be amended to take account of the
reassessment.
(5) If an objection to an assessment is lodged but a reassessment is made
before the objection is determined, the objection may be continued against the
reassessment to the extent that it is liable to the same objection or to an
objection that is the same, or similar, in substance.
[Section 18 amended: No. 12 of 2008 s. 35; No. 10 of 2013 s. 14.]

18A. Withdrawal of assessments

(1) The Commissioner may, within 5 years after the issue of a notice of
assessment, withdraw the assessment.
(2) An assessment may not be withdrawn if any amount of tax has been paid on
the assessment.
(3) The Commissioner must give a written notice of withdrawal to the taxpayer.
(4) If an assessment in respect of an event or transaction is withdrawn, the
assessment is taken never to have been made and, subject to this Act, the
Commissioner may make an assessment in respect of the event or transaction at
any time after the first-mentioned assessment is withdrawn.
[Section 18A inserted: No. 66 of 2003 s. 95(2).]

19. Assessments based on estimated or suspected liability

(1) If the Commissioner suspects on reasonable grounds that a tax liability
exists, the Commissioner may make an assessment on the basis of that suspicion
and the Commissioner's estimate of the amount of the liability.
(2) If a tax liability exists, but the Commissioner is not satisfied with the
adequacy or reliability of information available to make an assessment, the
Commissioner may make an assessment on the basis of the Commissioner's estimate
of the amount of the liability.
(3) The Commissioner cannot make an interim assessment under this section but
can make an assessment following an interim assessment under this section.
[Section 19 amended: No. 10 of 2013 s. 15.]

20A. Compromise assessments

(1) If the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so to avoid undue delay
or expense, to settle a dispute or for any other reason, the Commissioner may --
(a) make a written agreement (a compromise agreement) with a taxpayer in
relation to the assessment of the taxpayer's tax liability; and
(b) make an assessment in accordance with the compromise agreement.
(2A) The Commissioner cannot make an interim assessment in accordance with a
compromise agreement but can make an assessment following an interim assessment
in accordance with a compromise agreement.
(2) Despite section 16 the Commissioner must not make a reassessment of a
compromise assessment unless --
(a) the taxpayer has agreed; or
(b) the Commissioner is satisfied that the compromise assessment --
(i) was procured by fraud; or
(ii) was made in consequence of the taxpayer knowingly failing to disclose
material information or providing information knowing that it was incorrect,
incomplete or misleading.

(2ab) The no appeals election does not prevent the Commissioner from making an
appeal under the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 Part 5, without leave,
against the decision in the proceeding on a question of law if the Minister --
(a) certifies in writing that the question is significant for the protection of
the revenue of the State; and
(b) agrees to indemnify each other party to the proceeding in respect of any
cost involved in the appeal,
but a decision made by the Supreme Court in dealing with the appeal does not

matter cannot be sent back to the State Administrative Tribunal for
reconsideration.
(2a) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) --
(a) a person appointed as a supplementary President of the State Administrative
Tribunal under section 139 of the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 is not

Administrative Tribunal at every stage of a proceeding before it, including a
directions hearing or other hearing of a procedural nature before the Tribunal.
(3) If the final reassessment of the taxpayer's liability indicates that tax
has been overpaid, the taxpayer is entitled to a refund or credit of the
overpaid amount and the following amounts --
(a) any amount paid by the taxpayer for the lodging of a memorial under
section 76, 77 or 77A, if the Commissioner has lodged a withdrawal of the
memorial as a result of the final reassessment;
(b) interest during the reassessment period, calculated at the prescribed rate,
on the amount to be refunded or credited, including any amount referred to in
paragraph (a).
(4A) In subsection (3)(b) --
reassessment period, in relation to the payment of interest on an amount, means
the period --
(a) beginning on whichever is the later of --
(i) the date on which the overpaid amount was paid by the taxpayer; or
(ii) the date on which the assessment or decision the subject of the
Commissioner's decision to which the review proceedings relate, was made;
and
(b) ending on the date, on or after the date the Commissioner made the final
reassessment, on which the Commissioner approves the refunding or crediting of
the amount.
(4) For the purposes of subsection (3) --
(a) the final reassessment of a taxpayer's liability is the last assessment to
have been made as directed in the course of review proceedings at the time that
the case is discontinued or otherwise finally determined; and
(b) a refund or credit of an amount referred to in that subsection need not be
made until rights to take review proceedings (including any right that may
exist to seek special leave to appeal to the High Court) have been exhausted or
have expired, and no further reassessment can be made.
(5) The State Administrative Tribunal may, on its own initiative or the
application of a party, dismiss a proceeding relating to an objection against
an interim assessment once the assessment following the interim assessment is
made.

(b) is liable or may become liable to pay money to a taxpayer; or
(c) has authority to pay money to a taxpayer.
(2) A garnishee notice is a notice --

control to which the taxpayer is or becomes entitled to the Commissioner up to
the amount of a liability for tax stated in the notice; and
(b) fixing a time for payment (which cannot be before the time the taxpayer
becomes entitled to the money).
(3) The Commissioner may serve a garnishee notice even though the taxpayer's
entitlement to the money may be subject to unfulfilled conditions.
(4) However, a garnishee notice served on the employer of a taxpayer can
require the garnishee to pay to the Commissioner the wages payable by the

amount by which the amount of the wages exceeds the amount of average earnings
for that period calculated on the basis of statistics published in respect of
the period by the government statistician.

If a tax liability is incurred by or on behalf of a partnership, the tax is
recoverable jointly and severally from any one or more of the partners.

67. Recovery from directors of body corporate

(1) This section applies where the Commissioner believes, on reasonable
grounds, that --
(a) a body corporate has been trading while insolvent to the knowledge of a
director;
(b) the Commissioner has issued an assessment notice, which assessment consists
of or includes an amount in relation to pay-roll tax, to the body corporate,
and the amount assessed in relation to pay-roll tax has not been paid by the
due date.
(2) The Commissioner may serve notice on the director informing the director
that the director, along with any other directors of the body corporate on whom
the Commissioner serves notice in similar terms, will become jointly and
severally liable with the body corporate for the payment of the pay-roll tax
unless before the expiry of 28 days from the date of the notice the body
corporate remedies its default.
(3) The Commissioner must serve a notice under subsection (2) by arranging for
a copy of the notice to be given to each director personally.
(4) However, if, after exercising due diligence, it appears to the Commissioner
that it is not practicable to give a copy of the notice personally to a
director, then the Commissioner may apply to the Supreme Court for an order for
substituted service in accordance with section 117(2).
(5) For the purpose of this section, a body corporate is taken to remedy a
default if --
(a) the liability is paid; or
(b) the Commissioner by notice to the body corporate offers the body corporate
an opportunity to enter into a tax payment arrangement, and the body corporate
enters into the tax payment arrangement on conditions satisfactory to the
Commissioner; or
(c) the body corporate enters into voluntary administration under Part 5.3A of
the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth; or
(d) the body corporate goes into liquidation.
(6) If the body corporate fails to remedy its default within the time specified
in the notice to a director under this section, the directors become jointly
and severally liable, with the body corporate, for the payment of the tax
liability assessed against the body corporate.
(7) If a body corporate remedies its default by entering into a tax payment
arrangement but later contravenes a condition of the arrangement, the body
corporate's default is taken to revive and the Commissioner may serve another
notice on the directors under this section.
(8) In proceedings for recovery of tax from a director under this section, it
is a defence for the director to establish that --
(a) the director took all reasonable steps that were possible in the
circumstances to get the body corporate to remedy its default; or
(b) the director was unable because of illness or for some other proper reason
to take steps to get the body corporate to remedy its default.
(9) In proceedings for recovery of tax from a director under this section, the
onus of establishing that the director did not have the knowledge required by

document, information or relevant material was obtained without delay and
remains subject to subsection (2)(b) in the period between publication of the
decision of the court or judge and the return.

professional privilege from waiving its application to a document, information
or relevant material and a waiver once made cannot later be revoked.
(9) A person, either personally or on another's behalf, who claims that legal
professional privilege applies to a document, information or relevant material
and who knows, or ought to know at the time that claim is made that it is
false, misleading, or without substance, commits an offence.

^5 The State Administrative Tribunal (Conferral of Jurisdiction) Amendment and
Repeal Act 2004 Pt. 5, the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 s. 167 and
169, and the State Administrative Tribunal Regulations 2004 r. 28 and 42 deal
with certain transitional issues some of which may be relevant for this Act.
^6 The Revenue Laws Amendment (Tax Relief) Act 2004 Pt. 4 reads as follows:

                             Part 4 -- Reassessment
20. Certain instruments to be assessed again
(1) In this section --
Commissioner means the Commissioner of State Revenue appointed in accordance
with the Taxation Administration Act 2003 section 6;
duty means duty payable under the Stamp Act 1921;
former provisions means the provisions of the Stamp Act 1921 that are amended
by the Revenue Laws Amendment (Tax Relief) Act (No. 2) 2004 Part 4, as those
provisions were enacted immediately before 29 October 2004;
instrument means a conveyance or transfer of property or a contract, agreement
or other instrument that is chargeable with duty as a conveyance or transfer of
property;
new provisions means the provisions of the Stamp Act 1921 as amended by the
Revenue Laws Amendment (Tax Relief) Act (No. 2) 2004 Part 4.
(2) The Commissioner must make an assessment under the new provisions of the
duty on any instrument --
(a) which was first executed on or after 29 October 2004; and
(b) on which duty has been assessed under the former provisions.
(3) Subsection (2) does not authorise the Commissioner to make an assessment
under the new provisions of the duty on an instrument to the extent (if any) to
which the former provisions apply in relation to it under the Revenue Laws
Amendment (Tax Relief) Act (No. 2) 2004 section 9(2)(b).
(4) The Taxation Administration Act 2003 sections 18 and 54(1)(a) apply in
relation to an assessment under subsection (2) as if it were a reassessment
under section 16 of that Act.

^7 The amendment in the Duties Legislation Amendment Act 2008 s. 46 is not
included because the section it sought to amend had been replaced by the
Revenue Laws Amendment Act (No. 2) 2008 s. 7 before the amendment was to come
into operation.
