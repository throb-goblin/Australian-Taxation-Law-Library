Reducing registration and reporting requirements
 (3) The objects of this Act also include reducing the number of government registration and reporting requirements by making the system available to State, Territory and local government regulatory bodies.
Note: Section 30 facilitates this object by enabling the Registrar to provide information collected under this Act to State, Territory and local government bodies.
