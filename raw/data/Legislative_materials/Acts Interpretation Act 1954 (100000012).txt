Interpretation best achieving Actâs purpose
*** 14A Interpretation best achieving Actâs purpose ***

     interpretation that will best achieve the purpose of the Act is to be
     preferred to any other interpretation.
     (2) Subsection (1) does not create or extend criminal liability, but
     applies whether or not the Act âs purpose is expressly stated in
     the Act.
     (3) To remove any doubt, it is declared that this section applies to
     an Act passed after 30 June 1991 despite any presumption or rule of
     interpretation.
          Exampleâ
               There is judicial authority for a rule of
               interpretation that taxing legislation is to be
               interpreted strictly and in a taxpayerâs favour
               (for example, see Partington v AG (1869) LR 4 HL
               100 at 122). Despite such a possible rule, this
               section requires a provision imposing taxation to
               be interpreted in the way that best achieves the
               Act âs purpose, whether or not to do so would
               be in a taxpayerâs favour.
 
Use of extrinsic material in interpretation
*** 14B Use of extrinsic material in interpretation ***
     (1) Subject to subsection (2), in the interpretation of a provision
     of an Act, consideration may be given to extrinsic material capable
     of assisting in the interpretationâ
          (a) if the provision is ambiguous or obscureâto provide
          an interpretation of it; or
          (b) if the ordinary meaning of the provision leads to a
          result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonableâto
          provide an interpretation that avoids such a result; or
          (c) in any other caseâto confirm the interpretation
          conveyed by the ordinary meaning of the provision.
     (2) In determining whether consideration should be given to extrinsic
     material, and in determining the weight to be given to extrinsic
     material, regard is to be had toâ
          (a) the desirability of a provision being interpreted as
          having its ordinary meaning; and
          (b) the undesirability of prolonging proceedings without
          compensating advantage; and
          (c) other relevant matters.
     (3) In this sectionâ

     "extrinsic material" means relevant material not forming part of the
     Act concerned, including, for exampleâ
          (a) material set out in an official copy of the Act; and
          (b) a report of a royal commission, law reform commission,
          commission or committee of inquiry, or a similar body, that
          was laid before the Legislative Assembly before the
          provision concerned was enacted; and
          (c) a report of a committee of the Legislative Assembly
          that was made to the Legislative Assembly before the
          provision was enacted; and
          (d) a treaty or other international agreement that is
          mentioned in the Act; and
          (e) an explanatory note or memorandum relating to the Bill
          that contained the provision, or any other relevant
          document, that was laid before, or given to the members of,
          the Legislative Assembly by the member bringing in the Bill
          before the provision was enacted; and
          (f) the speech made to the Legislative Assembly by the
          member when introducing the Bill; and
               Noteâ
                    See section 53 in relation to Bills
                    introduced before the commencement of
                    that section.
     (g) material in an official record of proceedings in the Legislative
     Assembly; and
     (h) a document that is declared by an Act to be a relevant document
     for the purposes of this section.

"ordinary meaning" means the ordinary meaning conveyed by a provision having
regard to its context in the Act and to the purpose of the Act.
 
Changes of drafting practice not to affect meaning
*** 14C Changes of drafting practice not to affect meaning ***
Ifâ
     (a) a provision of an Act expresses an idea in particular words; and
     (b) a provision enacted later appears to express the same idea in
     different words for the purpose of implementing a different
     legislative drafting practice, including, for exampleâ
          (i) the use of a clearer or simpler style; or
          (ii) the use of gender-neutral language;
the ideas must not be taken to be different merely because different words are
used.
 
Other changes that do not affect general law
*** 14CA Other changes that do not affect general law ***
     (1) Ifâ
          (a) a provision of an Act expressly provides for an
          obligation to comply with the principles of natural
          justice; and
          (b) the provision is replaced by a corresponding provision
          that does not expressly provide for the obligation;
     the absence of an express provision for the obligation in the
     corresponding provision does not limit or otherwise affect an
     obligation under the corresponding provision to comply with
     procedural fairness implied under the general law.
     (2) Ifâ
          (a) a provision of an Act expressly provides for a function
          to be performed reasonably or a power to be exercised
          reasonably; and
          (b) the provision is replaced by a corresponding provision
          that does not expressly provide for the function to be
          performed reasonably or the power to be exercised
          reasonably;
     the absence of an express provision for the matter in the
     corresponding provision does not limit or otherwise affect an
     obligation under the corresponding provision to perform the function
     reasonably or exercise the power reasonably implied under the general
     law.
     (3) For this section, a provision of an Act (a
     "former provision") is replaced by a corresponding provision ifâ
          (a) an amendment of the Act omits the former provision and
          inserts a corresponding provision, whether in the same or a
          different location; or
          (b) the former provision is amended and the amended
          provision is a corresponding provision; or
          (c) the Act is repealed by an Act that includes a
          corresponding provision to the former provision.
     (4) In this sectionâ

     "corresponding provision", to another provision, means a provision
     that is substantially the same as, or substantially equivalent to,
     the other provision.
 
Examples
*** 14D Examples ***
If an Act includes an example of the operation of a provisionâ
     (a) the example is not exhaustive; and
     (b) the example does not limit, but may extend, the meaning of the
     provision; and
     (c) the example and the provision are to be read in the context of
     each other and the other provisions of the Act, but, if the example
     and the provision so read are inconsistent, the provision prevails.

                    automatically repealed under section
                    22C. The amendments made by Act A
                    continue to operate, even though Act A
                    has been repealed.

     or completed, and the right, privilege or liability may be enforced
     and the penalty imposed, as if the repeal or amendment had not
     happened.
     (4) Without limiting subsections (2) and (3), the repeal or amendment
     of an Act does not affectâ

          operation of the Act; or

     provision that is to form part of a series of provisions, and does
     not specify the position in the first provision where it is to be
     inserted, the second provision is to be inserted in the appropriate
     numerical or alphanumerical position.
     (7) If an Act amends a provision of a law by inserting an example,
     note or penalty, and does not specify the position in the provision
     where it is to be inserted, the example, note or penalty is to be
     inserted at the end of the provision.
     (8) In determining the appropriate position in which a provision is
     to be inserted, regard may be had to current Queensland legislative
     drafting practice.

                    The Hypothetical Amending Act 1995
                    amends the ABC Act and the LMN Act. It
                    also repeals a list of Acts set out in
                    a schedule. Apart fromâ
                         â¢ a long title
                         â¢ a provision about the Act
                         âs citation (that is, the
                         Act âs short title)
                         â¢ a provision about the Act
                         âs commencement
                         â¢ amending provisions (that
                         is, provisions stating that
                         the ABC Act and the LMN Act
                         are amended and the
                         provisions amending the Act
                         s)
                         â¢ repealing provisions
                         (that is, a provision stating
                         that the Act s set out in the
                         schedule are repealed and a
                         schedule)
                         â¢ a provision about the
                         application of section 20A to
                         a provision being repealed;
                    the Hypothetical Amending Act 1995
                    contains no other provisions. Its
                    repealing provisions commence on
                    assent, 21 March 1995. Its amending
                    provisions commence on proclamation, 12
                    April 1995. Under subsection (1), the
                    Hypothetical Amending Act 1995 is
                    automatically repealed at the beginning
                    of 13 April 1995.
     Example 2â
          The Example Act 1995 contains provisions establishing a new
          scheme. It also amends several Acts and repeals others.
          Because it contains the scheme provisions, it is not an
          amending Act covered by subsection (1).

"assent day" means the date of assent ofâ
     (a) if the provision provides for the extension of the period before
     commencement, under section 15DA (2), of an Actâthe Act; or
     (b) if the provision provides for the extension of the period before
     commencement, under section 15DA (2), of a provision of an Actâthe
     Act that enacts the provision.

     function may be performed, or the power may be exercised, as occasion

     confers a power (the
     "first power") on an entity to authorise or require another entity to
     exercise a power (the
     "second power"), then, if the first power is exercised, the provision
     is taken to confer the second power on the other entity.
     (2) In this sectionâ

     "power" includes doing an act or making a decision for the purpose of
     performing a function.

          year; and
          (b) the appointee may be reappointed to act in the office,

          year.

     of a vacancy in the office and the office becomes vacant, then,

          (a) the appointer otherwise directs; or
          (b) the vacancy ends; or
          (c) the end of a year from the day of the vacancy;
     whichever happens first.
     (6A) Subsection (6) (c) does not prevent a further appointment of the
     appointee to act for a period ending later than a year from the day
     of the vacancy.
     (7) The appointment ends if the appointee resigns by writing signed
     and delivered to the appointer.
     (7A) If the vacancy in the office in which a person is acting ends,
     the personâs appointment to act in the office because of the
     vacancy also ends.

     appears in the instrument of, or evidencing the, appointment to act.
     (7D) A personâs substantive appointment to an office does not end

          holder of the office.

          (c) the occasion for the person to act had not arisen or

               otherwise); and

Delegation of functions or powers
*** 27A Delegation of functions or powers ***
     (1) If an Act authorises a person or body to delegate a function or
     power, the person or body may, in accordance with the Act and any
     other applicable law, delegate the function or power toâ
          (a) a person or body by name; or
          (b) a specified officer, or the holder of a specified
          office, by reference to the title of the office concerned.
     (2) The delegation may beâ
          (a) general or limited; and
          (b) made from time to time; and
          (c) revoked, wholly or partly, by the delegator.
     (3) The delegation, or a revocation of the delegation, must be in, or
     evidenced by, writing signed by the delegator or, if the delegator is
     a body, by a person authorised by the body for the purpose.
     (3A) If the delegator is a body, the delegation may be made or
     revoked by a resolution of the body.
     (3B) All conditions and preliminary steps required for the exercise
     of a delegation are presumed to have been satisfied and performed
     unless the contrary is established.
     (3C) Laws apply to the delegate, and to other persons in relationship
     to the delegate, in the performance of the delegated function or in
     the exercise of a delegated power as if the delegate were the
     delegator.
     (3D) Anything done by or in relation to the delegate in relation to
     the delegation is taken to have been done by or in relation to the
     delegator.
          Exampleâ
               Under an Act an evidentiary certificate
               purporting to be signed by an office holder is
               evidence of the content in any proceeding (the
               "facilitation provision"). The Act confers a
               general power of delegation on the office holder.
               The office holder uses the power to delegate the
               function of issuing the certificate to someone
               else. Under subsections (3C) and (3D) (and (6)
               and (7)), the facilitation provision is taken to
               provide for the certificate purporting to be
               signed by the delegate as having been signed by
               the delegator.
     (4) A delegated function or power may be exercised only in accordance
     with any conditions to which the delegation is subject.
     (5) The delegate may, in the performance of a delegated function or
     in the exercise of a delegated power, do anything that is incidental
     to the delegated function or power.
     (6) A delegated function or power that purports to have been
     performed or exercised by the delegate is taken to have been properly
     performed or exercised by the delegate unless the contrary is proved.
     (7) A delegated function or power that is properly performed or
     exercised by the delegate is taken to have been performed or
     exercised by the delegator.
     (8) If, when performed or exercised by the delegator, a function or
     power is dependent on the delegatorâs opinion, belief or state of
     mind, then, when performed or exercised by the delegate, the function
     or power is dependent on the delegateâs opinion, belief or state of
     mind.
     (8A) Ifâ
          (a) the delegator is a specified officer or the holder of a
          specified office; and
          (b) the person who was the specified officer or holder of
          the specified office when the delegation was made ceases to
          be the officer or holder of the office;
     thenâ
          (c) the delegation continues in force; and
          (d) the person for the time being occupying or acting in
          the office concerned is taken to be the delegator for the
          purposes of this section.
     (8B) Ifâ
          (a) the delegator is a body; and
          (b) there is a change in the membership of the body;
     thenâ
          (c) the delegation continues in force; and
          (d) the body as constituted for the time being is taken to
          be the delegator for the purposes of this section.
     (9) If a function or power is delegated to a specified officer or the
     holder of a specified officeâ
          (a) the delegation does not cease to have effect merely
          because the person who was the specified officer or the
          holder of the specified office when the function or power
          was delegated ceases to be the officer or the holder of the
          office; and
          (b) the function or power may be performed or exercised by
          the person for the time being occupying or acting in the
          office concerned.
     (10) A function or power that has been delegated may, despite the
     delegation, be performed or exercised by the delegator.
     (10A) The delegation of a function or power does not relieve the
     delegator of the delegatorâs obligation to ensure that the function
     or power is properly performed or exercised.
     (11) Subject to subsection (12), this section applies to a
     subdelegation of a function or power in the same way as it applies to
     a delegation of a function or power.
     (12) If an Act authorises the delegation of a function or power, the
     function or power may be subdelegated only if the Act expressly
     authorises the function or power to be subdelegated.
     (13) Writing purporting to be, or to contain, a delegation, or the
     revocation of a delegation, is evidence of the delegation or
     revocation.
     (14) A certificate signed by the delegator (or, if the delegator is a
     body, by a person authorised by the body for the purpose) stating
     anything in relation to a delegation is evidence of the thing.
     (15) A document purporting to be a certificate mentioned in
     subsection (14) is taken to be the certificate, and to have been
     properly given, unless the contrary is established.
     (15A) Authority to delegate a personâs or bodyâs powers includes
     authority to delegate doing an act or making a decision for
     performing a function of the person or body.

*** 48B Value of fee unit ***
     (1) A regulation may prescribe a monetary amount to be the value of a

          (a) the amount prescribed under this section; or
          (b) if no amount is prescribedâ$1.
 
Working out amounts
*** 48C Working out amounts ***
     (1) An Act may express a fee or other matter as a number (whether
     whole or fractional) of fee units.
     (2) The Act may also provide for how an amount is to be rounded for
     the purpose of subsection (3).
     (3) The amount of the fee or other matter is the number of dollars
     obtained byâ
          (a) multiplying the value of a fee unit for the Act by the
          number of fee units; and
          (b) rounding the resultâ
               (i) if the Act provides for how the result is to
               be roundedâin that way; or
               (ii) otherwiseâto the nearest cent (rounding
               one-half upwards).
          Exampleâ
               A regulation under section 48B prescribes $1.015
               to be the value of a fee unit for an Act. The Act
               provides for a licence fee of 120.44 fee units
               and does not provide for how amounts are to be
               rounded for the purpose of this subsection. The
               number of dollars obtained by multiplying $1.015
               by 120.44 is $122.2466. So, after rounding, the
               amount of the licence fee is $122.25.
 
Verification of documents
*** 49 Verification of documents ***
If an Act requires that, for a purpose of the Act or another law, a document,
or information or a document included in, attached to or given with a document,
be verified in a specified way, the purpose is not fulfilled unless the
requirement is satisfied.
     Exampleâ
          If an Act requires a document accompanying an application
          form to be verified by statutory declaration and the
          document is lodged without being verified in this way, the
          document has not been properly lodged for the purposes of
          the Act.
