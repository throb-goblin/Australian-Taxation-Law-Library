Part 2      Partnerships generally

Division 1  Nature of Partnerships

5     Partnership

      (1)   A partnership is the  relation  between  people  carrying  on  a
         business in common with a view of profit, and includes an  external
         partnership and incorporated limited partnership.

      (2)   However, the relation  between  members  of  an  association  or

         is not a partnership.

         reference to an association formed under a  law  in  force  in  the
         Territory.

6     Determining existence of partnership other than incorporated limited
         partnership

       (1)    In  determining  whether  a   partnership   (other   than   an
         incorporated limited partnership) exists regard is to be had to the
         following rules:

         (a)      joint tenancy, tenancy in common, joint  property,  common
             property, or part ownership,  does  not  of  itself  create  a
             partnership as to anything held or owned, whether the  tenants
             or owners do or do not share any profits made by  the  use  of
             any thing held or owned;

         (b)      the sharing of gross returns does not of itself  create  a
             partnership, whether the persons sharing the returns  have  or
             have not a joint or common right or interest in  any  property
             from which, or from the use of which, the returns are derived;

         (c)      the receipt by a person of a share of  the  profits  of  a
             business is prima facie evidence that the person is a  partner
             in the business, but the receipt of a share of the profits  of
             a business or of a payment contingent on or varying  with  the
             profits of a business does not of itself  make  the  person  a
             partner in the business, and in particular:

             (i) the receipt by a person of  a  debt  or  other  liquidated
                  amount by instalments or otherwise  out  of  the  accruing
                  profits of a business does not of itself make the person a
                  partner in the business or liable as a partner;

             (ii)      a contract for the remuneration of  an  employee  or
                  agent of a person engaged in a business by a share of  the
                  profits of the  business  does  not  of  itself  make  the
                  employee or agent a partner in the business or liable as a
                  partner;

             (iii)     a person being a spouse, de facto partner  or  child
                  of a deceased partner and receiving by way  of  annuity  a
                  portion of the profits made in the business in  which  the
                  deceased person was a partner does not of itself make  the
                  person a partner in the business or liable as a partner;

             (iv)      the advance of money by way  of  loan  to  a  person
                  engaged, or about to engage, in a business on  a  contract
                  with the person that the lender will  receive  a  rate  of
                  interest varying with the profits or will receive a  share
                  of the profits arising from carrying on the business  does
                  not of itself make the lender a partner with the person or
                  persons carrying on the business or liable as a partner;

             (v) a person receiving  by  way  of  annuity  or  otherwise  a
                  portion of the profits of a business in  consideration  of
                  the sale by that person of the goodwill of the business is
                  not by reason only  of  such  receipt  a  partner  in  the
                  business or liable as such.

      (2)   A contract referred to  in  subsection  (1)(c)(iv)  must  be  in
         writing and signed by or on behalf of  all  the  parties  for  that
         subparagraph to apply.

7     Postponement of rights of person lending or selling in case of
         bankruptcy

         Where:

         (a)      a person to whom money has been advanced by way of loan on
             a contract referred in section 6; or

         (b)      a buyer of goodwill in consideration of  a  share  of  the
             profits of a business,

         becomes bankrupt, enters into an arrangement  to  pay  his  or  her
         creditors less than 100Â cents in the dollar or dies insolvent,

         (c)      the lender of the loan is not entitled to recover anything
             in respect of the loan; and

         (d)      the seller of the goodwill  is  not  entitled  to  recover
             anything in respect of the share of profits contracted for,

         until the claims of the other creditors of the  borrower  or  buyer
         for valuable consideration in money  or  money's  worth  have  been
         satisfied.

8     Firm and firm name

      (1)   The  partners  in  a  partnership  other  than  an  incorporated
         limited partnership are collectively called a  firm  and  its  firm
         name is:

         (a)      for an external partnership â the  name  under  which  its
             business is carried on under the law of the place where it  is
             formed; or

         (b)      otherwise â the name under which its business  is  carried
             on in the Territory.

      (2)   An incorporated limited partnership is a firm and its firm  name
         is its registered name.

Division 2  Relationship of partners to persons dealing with them

9     Partner's power to bind firm

      (1)    A  partner  in  a  firm  other  than  an  incorporated  limited
         partnership is, for the firm's business, an agent of the  firm  and
         of the firm's other partners.

      (2)   An act of the partner in carrying on in the usual  way  business
         of the kind carried on by the firm  binds  the  firm  and  all  its
         partners, unless:

         (a)      the partner had no authority to act in the matter; and

         (b)      the person with whom the partner is dealing:

             (i) knew the partner did not have that authority; or

             (ii)      did not know or believe the partner was a partner in
                  the firm.

      (3)   A general partner in an  incorporated  limited  partnership  is,
         for the firm's business, an agent of the firm  and  of  the  firm's
         other general partners.

      (4)   An act of the general partner in carrying on in  the  usual  way
         business of the kind  carried  on  by  the  partnership  binds  the
         partnership and all its other general partners, unless:

         (a)      the general partner had no authority to act in the matter;
             and

         (b)      the person with whom the general partner is dealing:

             (i) knew the general partner did not have that authority; or

             (ii)      did not know or believe the general  partner  was  a
                  general partner in the partnership.

10    Partner acting for firm

      (1)   An act of a person relating to the  business  of  a  firm  other
         than an incorporated limited partnership binds the firm and all its
         partners if the person is authorised by the firm to carry  out  the
         act:

         (a)      in the firm name; or

         (b)      in any other way showing an intention to bind the firm.

      (2)   Subject to section 13(4), an act of a  person  relating  to  the
         business  of  an  incorporated  limited   partnership   binds   the
         partnership  and  all  its  general  partners  if  the  person   is
         authorised by the partnership to carry out the act:

         (a)      in the partnership's firm name; or

         (b)      in  any  other  way  showing  an  intention  to  bind  the
             partnership.

      (3)   To avoid doubt:

         (a)      a reference to a person authorised by a firm to carry  out
             an act includes a reference  to  a  partner  in  the  firm  so
             authorised; and

         (b)      this section does not affect any rule  of  law  about  the
             execution of deeds or negotiable instruments.

11    Partner using firm's credit

      (1)   The use of the credit of  a  firm  other  than  an  incorporated
         limited partnership by one  of  its  partners  for  a  purpose  not
         apparently related to its ordinary business does not bind it unless
         the partner is specially authorised by the other partners to do so.

      (2)   The use of an incorporated limited partnership's credit  by  one
         of its general partners for a purpose not apparently related to its
         ordinary business does not bind it unless the  general  partner  is
         specially authorised by it to do so.

      (3)   To avoid doubt,  this  section  does  not  affect  any  personal
         liability of a partner in a partnership.

12    Effect of notice of agreement that firm not bound

         If an act contravenes an  agreement  restricting  the  power  of  a
         partner to bind a firm, the act does not bind the firm in  relation
         to a person who has notice of the agreement.

13    Liability of partner

      (1)   Each partner in  a  firm  other  than  an  incorporated  limited
         partnership  is  liable  jointly  with  the  other   partners   for
         liabilities incurred by the firm while the partner is that partner.

      (2)   Each general partner in an incorporated limited  partnership  is
         liable jointly with the partnership for liabilities incurred by the
         partnership while the general partner is that general partner.

      (3)   The estate of the partner referred to in subsection (1),  or  of
         the general partner  referred  to  in  subsection  (2),  is  liable
         severally for the liabilities referred to in that subsection:

         (a)      to the extent to which the liabilities remain unsatisfied;
             and

         (b)      only after the separate liabilities  of  that  partner  or
             general partner have been satisfied.

      (4)   However, the general partner or the general partner's estate  is
         only liable for the liabilities:

         (a)      to the extent to which the partnership cannot satisfy  the
             liabilities; or

         (b)      to a greater extent provided by the partnership agreement.

14    Liability for loss, injury or penalty

      (1)   A firm other than an incorporated limited partnership is  liable
         to the same extent as a partner in the firm for any loss, injury or
         penalty caused by an act (including omission) of the partner if:

         (a)      the act occurred while  the  partner  was  acting  in  the
             ordinary course of the firm's business or with  the  authority
             of the other partners; and

         (b)      for a loss or injury â the loss or injury is not  suffered
             by a partner in the firm.

         creditor of  a  partner,  make  an  order  charging  the  partner's
         interest in the partnership property and profits  with  payment  of
         the amount of the judgment debt and interest, and may, by the  same
         or a subsequent order, appoint a receiver of the partner's share of
         profits (whether already declared or accruing)  and  of  any  other
         money that  may  be  coming  to  the  partner  in  respect  of  the
         partnership, and direct all accounts and  inquiries  and  give  all
         other orders and directions that might have been directed or  given
         if the charge had been made in favour of the judgment  creditor  by
         the partner, or which the circumstances of the case may require.

             conduct that in the opinion of the Court, regard being had  to

             Court, make it just and  equitable  that  the  partnership  be
             dissolved.

      (2)   An application for an order under subsection (1)(a) may be  made

         necessary to wind up the affairs of the partnership and to complete
         transactions begun but not finished at the time of the dissolution,
         but not otherwise.

      (2)   A firm is in no case bound by the acts  of  a  partner  who  has

         partnership for a fixed  term  and  the  partnership  is  dissolved
         before the expiration of the term, otherwise than by the death of a
         partner, the Supreme Court may order the repayment of  the  premium
         or of a part of it as it thinks just, having regard to the terms of
         the partnership contract and to the length of time the  partnership
         has continued, unless:

         (a)      the dissolution is, in the opinion of the Court, wholly or

             premium; or

         (b)      the partnership has been dissolved by  an  agreement  that
             does not contain a provision for a return of any part  of  the

         right, entitled:

         (a)      to a lien on, or right of retention of, the surplus of the
             partnership   assets,   after   satisfying   the   partnership
             liabilities for any sum of money paid by the partner  for  the
             purchase of a share in the partnership  and  for  any  capital
             contributed by the partner;

         firm with its capital or assets without  any  final  settlement  of
         accounts as between the firm and the outgoing partner or his or her
         estate, then, in the absence of an agreement to the  contrary,  the
         outgoing partner or his or her estate is entitled, at  his  or  her
         option or the option of his or her representatives:

         (a)      to the share of the profits made since the dissolution  as

         (b)      to interest at the rate of 7% per annum on the  amount  of
             his or her share of the partnership assets.

      (2)   Subsection (1) does not apply where by the partnership  contract
         an option is given to surviving or continuing partners to  purchase
         the interest of a deceased or outgoing partner and  the  option  is
         duly exercised except where a partner assuming to act  in  exercise
         of the option does not, in all material respects, comply  with  the

             lastly, if necessary, by  the  partners  individually  in  the
             proportion in which they were entitled to share profits;

         (b)      the assets of  the  firm,  including  the  sums,  if  any,
             contributed by the partners to make up losses or  deficiencies
             of capital, are to be applied  in  the  following  manner  and

             (i) in paying the debts and liabilities of the firm to persons
                  who are not partners;

             (ii)      in paying to a partner, rateably, what is  due  from

                  capital;

             (iii)     in paying to a partner, rateably, what is  due  from

         Territory or another jurisdiction  (including  a  foreign  country)
         that provides for the limitation of a partner in a  partnership  to
         be a corresponding law.

      (2)   In addition, any other law of  a  State,  another  Territory  or
         another   jurisdiction   (including   a   foreign   country)   that
         substantially corresponds to the provisions in this Act that relate
         to incorporated limited partnerships is a corresponding law.

74    Partnership formed under corresponding laws

      (1)   A partner in a partnership formed under a corresponding law  may
         only be liable for a liability incurred by the partnership  for  an
         act that occurred in the Territory if the partner would  be  liable
         under that law  had  the  act  occurred  in  the  place  where  the
         partnership was formed.

      (2)   For subsection (1), a reference to an act includes  a  reference
         to:

         (a)      the conduct of the partnership's business; or

         (b)      an act (including omission) of:

             (i) the partnership; or

             (ii)      a partner in the partnership; or

             (iii)     an officer, employee or agent of the partnership  or
                  a partner in the partnership.

75    Effect of sections 72 and 74

      (1)   To avoid doubt, sections 72 and 74 do not imply that  a  limited
         partner in an incorporated limited partnership:

         (a)      has any liability; or

         (b)      would, apart from those sections, have any liability,

         for an act occurred outside the Territory that the limited  partner
         would not have if the act had occurred in the Territory.

      (2)   In subsection (1):

         act has the same meaning as in  section  72  or  74  (as  the  case
         requires).
