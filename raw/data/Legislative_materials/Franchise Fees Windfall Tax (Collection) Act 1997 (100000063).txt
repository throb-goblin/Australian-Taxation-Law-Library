                in ScheduleÂ 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.

PartÂ 2âLiability

6  Taxable amount

      (1)   A taxable amount is any amount that meets all the following
         conditions:
      (a)   a State is liable to repay the amount to a person (the
             taxpayer) because a State franchise law is wholly or partly
             invalid because of sectionÂ 90 of the Constitution;
      (b)   the amount is by way of repayment of an amount paid under the
             State franchise law before 5Â August 1997 in respect of a
             licensing period commencing before 5Â August 1997;
      (c)   the amount is claimed by the taxpayer from the State, or a
             court orders the State to pay the amount to the taxpayer.

      (2)   A taxable amount is reduced by deducting any part of it that a
         State would have been liable to repay even if the State franchise
         law were wholly valid.

         Example: An amount that is repayable solely because of an
                overpayment by the taxpayer would be deducted.

7  Reduction of taxable amountâliquor franchise fees

      (1)   If a taxable amount calculated under sectionÂ 6 relates to a
         liquor franchise fee for which the licensing period ends after
         6Â August 1997, then the taxable amount is reduced by an amount
         calculated as follows:

         [pic]

      (2)   If:
      (a)   a State franchise law required or permitted the payment by
             instalments of a liquor franchise fee for a licensing period
             (the actual licensing period); and
      (b)   at least one of those instalments was payable after 6Â August
             1997;
         then this section applies as if each of the following periods were
         a separate licensing period (in place of the actual licensing
         period):
      (c)   the period starting on the day on which an instalment was
             payable and ending immediately before the day on which the next
             instalment was payable;
      (d)   the period starting on the day on which last instalment was
             payable and ending at the end of the actual licensing period.

      (3)   In this section:

         liquor franchise fee means a fee payable under a law specified in
         paragraph 4(2)(a), (e), (g), (h), (k), (o), (t) or (v).

8  Liability to windfall tax

      (1)   The taxpayer in respect of a taxable amount is the person to
         whom the State was liable to repay the taxable amount.

         Note:    SectionÂ 9 extinguishes the liability of the State to repay
                the taxable amount.

      (2)   The person who is the taxpayer in respect of a taxable amount
         is liable to pay windfall tax on the taxable amount.

PartÂ 3âCollection

9  State must withhold windfall tax from taxable amounts

         State must withhold and remit windfall tax

      (1)   A State that is liable to repay a taxable amount must not repay
         or otherwise apply the taxable amount without first having deducted
         the tax on the taxable amount.

      (2)   As soon as practicable after making a deduction under
         subsectionÂ (1), the State must notify the taxpayer in writing that
         the deduction was made.

      (3)   A State that makes a deduction under subsectionÂ (1) must remit
         it to the Commissioner within 21 days after the end of the month in
         which the deduction is made. The remitted tax must be accompanied
         by a statement that:
      (a)   sets out the amount deducted; and
      (b)   identifies the taxpayer.

         State discharged from liability to account

      (4)   When a State makes a deduction from a taxable amount under
         subsectionÂ (1) (or purportedly under subsectionÂ (1)), the State is
         discharged from any liability to pay or account for the amount
         deducted to any person other than the Commissioner.

10  Taxpayer entitled to credit for amount deducted by State

      (1)   When a State makes a deduction from a taxable amount under
         sectionÂ 9 (or purportedly under sectionÂ 9), the taxpayer is
         entitled to a credit equal to the amount deducted.

      (2)   However, the taxpayer is not entitled to a credit for any
         amount purportedly deducted under sectionÂ 9 in relation to an
         amount paid under a valid State franchise law.

      (3)   The credit is a debt due to the taxpayer by the Commissioner on
         behalf of the Commonwealth.

      (4)   The Commissioner may apply some or all of the credit against
         the taxpayerâs liability to windfall tax (whether or not that
         liability is in respect of the taxable amount that gives rise to
         the credit). The Commissioner must refund any amount not applied.

11  Regulations for collection etc. of unpaid windfall tax

            The regulations may provide for the collection and recovery of
         any unpaid windfall tax. In particular, the regulations may:
      (a)   prescribe the time when windfall tax is due for payment; and
      (b)   prescribe penalties for late payment of windfall tax (not
             exceeding an amount calculated at the rate of 20% per annum).

         Note:    Windfall tax would normally be collected under sectionÂ 9.

PartÂ 4âMiscellaneous

12  Annual report

            After the end of each financial year, the Commissioner must
         give a report to the Minister, for presentation to the Parliament,
         on the operation of this Act during the year.

13  Arrangements with States

      (1)   The Commissioner may make an arrangement with an appropriate
         officer or authority of a State about any matter in connection with
         the administration of this Act.

      (2)   In particular, an arrangement may relate to the Commissionerâs
         delegation of powers or functions under this Act or the
         regulations.

         Note:    SectionÂ 8 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 contains
                the Commissionerâs delegation power.

14  Regulations

      (1)   The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:
      (a)   required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or
      (b)   necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or
             giving effect to this Act.

      (2)   In particular, the regulations may prescribe penalties for
         offences against the regulations by way of fines of up to 10
         penalty units.
