     superannuation contribution mentioned in subsection (2) is for an
     employeeâs services performed or rendered before 1 January 2000,
     the part is not wages.
     (4) Also, for paragraph (g) of the definitionâ
          (a) a superannuation contribution paid or payable by an
          employer to a superannuation, provident or retirement fund
          or scheme and not attributed by the employer as paid or
          payable for a particular employee or particular employees
          is taken to be paid or payable for the employee or
          employees decided by the commissioner; and
          (b) a superannuation contribution paid on or after 14
          September 1999 and before 1 January 2000 for an
          employeeâs services to be performed or rendered on or
          after 1 January 2000 is taken to be paid on 1 January 2000.
     (5) For this Act, the amount or value of wages paid or payable to a
     person must be reduced by the relevant proportion of the amount of
     any GST paid or payable by the person on the supply to which the
     wages relate.
     (6) In this sectionâ

     "relevant proportion", for GST paid or payable on a supply to which
     wages relate, means the proportion that the amount or value of the
     wages bears to the consideration for the supply to which the wages
     relate.
 
Meaning of change of status
*** 5 Meaning of change of status ***
     (1) A
     "change of status" happens for a person who is an employer if, during

          (a) the person ceases to be an employer and does not intend
          to resume being an employer during the remainder of the
          year or the next financial year; or
               Example for paragraph (a)â
                    There is no change of status for a
                    fruit grower who ceases to pay wages
                    after the fruit picking season but
                    intends to resume paying wages later in
                    the financial year or in the next
                    financial year.
     (b) for a person who pays, or is liable to pay, taxable wages and who

               wages; and
               (ii) does not intend to resume paying wages for
               the remainder of the year or the next financial
               year; or

     (e) if subsection (1) (d) appliesâ
          (i) if all the group members cease to pay, or be liable to
          pay, wages as members of the group during the relevant
          periodic return period on or before the day the person
          ceases to be the DGE for the groupâon the first day the
          person is not the DGE for the group; or
          (ii) otherwiseâon the first day of the relevant periodic
          return period; or

          Notesâ
                    1 If an employer who is not a group
                    member changes status, the employer is
                    required to lodge a final return for,
                    and pay, payroll tax and the mental
                    health levy for the final period.
                    2 If an employer who is the DGE for a
                    group changes status, the DGE is
                    required to lodge a final return for,
                    and pay, payroll tax and the mental
                    health levy for the final period.
                    3 If an employer who is a non-DGE group
                    member changes statusâ
                         (a) the employer is required
                         to lodge a final return for,
                         and pay, payroll tax for the
                         final period; and
                         (b) the DGE for the group is
                         required to lodge a final
                         return for, and pay, the
                         mental health levy for the
                         final period.
 
Meaning of final period
*** 6 Meaning of final period ***
The
"final period", for a change of status of a person (the
"relevant change of status") happening during a financial year, means the
periodâ
     (a) starting on the latest of the following days in the yearâ
          (i) 1 July;
          (ii) the first day on which the person is required to
          register as an employer under part 3, division 1;
          (iii) if an earlier change of status has happened for the
          person during the yearâthe day of the change of status
          happening immediately before the relevant change of status;
          and
     (b) ending on the day before the relevant change of status happens.
     Exampleâ
          An employer who is a group member from 1 July in a
          financial year ceases to be a group member on 1 September.
          The final period for the change of status is 1 July to 31
          August.
          If the employer then ceases to pay, or be liable to pay,
          wages from 1 June, the final period for the second change
          of status is 1 September to 31 May.
 
Reference to periodic return period or return period
*** 6A Reference to periodic return period or return period ***
Despite section 59 (1A), a reference in this Act, other than section 59 (1), to
a periodic return period or return period in relation to an employer is taken
to include the last periodic return period of a financial year for the
employer.

Wages liable to payroll tax and mental health levyânexus with Queensland
*** 9 Wages liable to payroll tax and mental health levyânexus with
Queensland ***
     (1) Wages are liable to payroll tax and the mental health levy under
     this Act ifâ
          (a) the wages are paid or payable by an employer in
          relation to services performed or rendered by an employee
          entirely in Queensland; or
          (b) the wages are paid or payable by an employer in
          relation to services performed or rendered by an employee
          in 2 or more States, or partly in at least 1 State and
          partly outside all States, andâ
               (i) the employee is based in Queensland; or
               (ii) if the employee is not based in a
               Stateâthe employer is based in Queensland; or
               (iii) if both the employee and the employer are
               not based in a Stateâthe wages are paid or
               payable in Queensland; or
               (iv) if both the employee and the employer are
               not based in a State and the wages are not paid
               or payable in a Stateâthe wages are paid or
               payable for services performed or rendered mainly
               in Queensland; or
          (c) the wages are paid or payable by an employer in
          relation to services performed or rendered by an employee
          entirely outside all States and are paid or payable in
          Queensland.
          Noteâ
               Section 15A provides an exemption for wages paid
               or payable for services performed entirely in
               another country for a continuous period of more
               than 6 months.
     (2) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), the question of whether wages
     are liable to payroll tax and the mental health levy under this Act
     must be decided by reference only to the services performed or
     rendered by the employee for the employer during the month in which
     the wages are paid or payable.
     (3) Wages paid or payable by an employer for an employee in a
     particular month are taken to be paid or payable in relation to the
     services performed or rendered by the employee for the employer
     during the month.
          Exampleâ
               If wages paid in a month are paid to an employee
               for services performed or rendered over several
               months, the question of whether the wages are
               liable to payroll tax and the mental health levy
               under this Act must be decided by reference only
               to the services performed or rendered by the
               employee in the month the wages are paid. The
               services performed or rendered in previous months
               are disregarded. However, the services performed
               or rendered in previous months are relevant to
               the question of whether wages paid in the
               previous months are liable to payroll tax and the
               mental health levy under this Act.
     (4) If no services are performed or rendered by an employee for an
     employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable in
     relation to the employeeâ
          (a) the question of whether the wages are liable to payroll
          tax and the mental health levy under this Act must be
          decided by reference only to the services performed or
          rendered by the employee for the employer during the most
          recent earlier month in which the employee performed or
          rendered services for the employer; and
          (b) the wages are taken to be paid or payable in relation
          to the services performed or rendered by the employee for
          the employer in that most recent earlier month.
     (5) If no services were performed or rendered by an employee for an
     employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable in
     relation to the employee or in any earlier monthâ
          (a) the wages are taken to be paid or payable in relation
          to services performed or rendered by the employee in the
          month in which the wages are paid or payable; and
          (b) the services are taken to have been performed or
          rendered at a place where it may reasonably be expected
          that the services of the employee for the employer will
          first be performed.
     (6) All amounts of wages paid or payable in the same month by the
     same employer for the same employee must be aggregated for deciding
     whether the wages are liable to payroll tax and the mental health
     levy under this Act.
          Exampleâ
               If 1 amount of wages is paid by an employer in a
               particular month in relation to services
               performed or rendered in Queensland, and another
               amount of wages is paid by the same employer in
               the same month in relation to services performed
               or rendered by the same employee in another
               State, the wages paid must be aggregated as if
               they were paid or payable in relation to all
               services performed or rendered by the employee in
               that month. Subsection (1) (b) would be applied
               to decide whether the wages are liable to payroll
               tax and the mental health levy under this Act.
     (7) If wages are paid in a different month from the month in which
     they are payable, the question of whether the wages are liable to
     payroll tax and the mental health levy under this Act must be decided
     by reference to the earlier of the relevant months.
 
State in which employee is based
*** 9A State in which employee is based ***
     (1) For this Act, the State in which an employee is based is the
     State in which the employeeâs principal place of residence is
     located.
     (2) The State in which an employee is based must be decided by
     reference to the state of affairs existing during the month in which
     the relevant wages are paid or payable.
     (3) If more than 1 State would qualify as the State in which an
     employee is based during a month, the State in which the employee is
     based must be decided by reference to the state of affairs existing
     on the last day of that month.
     (4) An employee who does not have a principal place of residence is
     taken, for this Act, to be an employee who is not based in a State.
     (5) If wages are paid or payable to a corporate employee, the State
     in which the corporate employee is based must be worked out under
     section 9B instead of this section, as if a reference in section 9B
     to an employer were a reference to the employee.
     (6) In this sectionâ

     "corporate employee" means a companyâ
          (a) taken to be an employee under section 13D or 13I; or

          employerâs registered business address is located; or
          (b) otherwiseâthe State in which the employerâs
          principal place of business is located.
     (2) If wages are paid or payable in connection with a business
     carried on by an employer under a trust, the employerâs registered
     business address isâ
          (a) if the trust has an ABNâthe registered business
          address of the trust; or
          (b) otherwiseâthe registered business address of the
          trustee of the trust.
     (3) If an employer has 2 or more registered business addresses
     located in different States at the same time, the State in which the
     employer is based at that time is the State in which the employerâs
     principal place of business is located.
     (4) The State in which an employer is based must be decided by
     reference to the state of affairs existing during the month in which
     the relevant wages are paid or payable.
     (5) If more than 1 State would qualify as the State in which an
     employer is based in a month, the State in which the employer is
     based must be decided by reference to the state of affairs existing
     on the last day of that month.
     (6) An employer who has neither a registered business address nor a
     principal place of business is taken, for this Act, to be an employer
     who is not based in a State.
     (7) In this sectionâ

     System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cwlth).

Place and day of payment of wages
*** 9C Place and day of payment of wages ***
     (1) For this Act, wages are taken to have been paid at a place if,
     for the payment of the wagesâ
          (a) an instrument is sent or given or an amount is
          transferred by an employer to a person or a personâs
          agent at the place; or
          (b) an instruction is given by an employer for the
          crediting of an amount to the account of a person or a
          personâs agent at the place.
     (2) The wages are taken to have been paid on the day the instrument
     was sent or given, the amount was transferred, or the account was
     credited.
     (3) Subject to subsection (4), wages are taken to be payable at the
     place they are paid.
     (4) Wages that are not paid by the end of the month in which they are
     payable are taken to be payable atâ

          for the employee; or
          (b) if wages have not previously been paid by the employer
          for the employeeâthe place where the employee last
          performed or rendered services for the employer before the
          wages became payable.
     (5) If wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer
     for the same employee are paid or payable in more than 1 State, the
     wages paid or payable in that month are taken to be paid or payable
     in the State in which the highest proportion of the wages are paid or
     payable.
          Noteâ
               Section 9 requires all wages paid or payable in
               the same month by the same employer for the same
               employee to be aggregated for deciding whether
               the wages are liable to payroll tax or the mental
               health levy under this Act. Subsection (5)
               ensures only 1 State can be considered to be the
               State in which the wages are paid or payable.

Particular avoidance arrangements involving employment agents
*** 13LA Particular avoidance arrangements involving employment agents ***
     (1) This section applies ifâ
          (a) an avoidance arrangement exists in relation to an
          employment agency in a return period; and
          (b) the assumed non-adjusted tax and levy for the period is
          less than the assumed adjusted tax and levy for the period.
     (2) If this section applies in a return period, for the periodâ
          (a) if the avoidance arrangement involves an employment
          agent acting as trustee for a client of the employment
          agent under a trust or acting as agent for a client of the
          employment agent under an employment agency contractâ
          section 92 (1) does not apply to the trustee or agent, or
          in relation to the trust or employment agency contract; and
          (b) if the avoidance arrangement involves a client of an
          employment agent acquiring, or clients of an employment
          agent jointly acquiring, a controlling interest in the
          business of the employment agent referable to the client or
          clientsâthe client or clients is or are taken not to have
          the controlling interest; and
          (c) the employment agent, or each employment agent,
          involved in the employment agency is answerable as an
          employer for doing everything required to be done under
          this Act for the payment of wages by the employment agent
          that are subject to payroll tax or the mental health levy
          under this Act (including the giving of returns and payment
          of payroll tax or the mental health levy); and
          (d) if the employment agency involves more than 1
          employment agentâthe employment agents constitute a
          group.
     (3) For this section, a client has, or clients have, a controlling
     interest in a business if the client has, or the clients have, a
     controlling interest in the business under section 71.
     (4) In subsection (1) â
          (a) a reference to the assumed non-adjusted tax and levy
          for a return period is a reference to the total amount of
          payroll tax and the mental health levy that would be
          payable by the employment agent or agents involved in the
          employment agency for the period if the amount were
          calculated without applying any resultant provision; and
          (b) a reference to the assumed adjusted tax and levy for a
          return period is a reference to the total amount of payroll
          tax and the mental health levy that would be payable by the
          employment agent or agents involved in the employment
          agency for the period if the amount were calculated
          applying each relevant resultant provision.
     (5) To remove any doubt about the application of subsection (4) (b),
     it is declared that if an employment agency is involved in more than
     1 avoidance arrangement in a return period, subsection (4) (b) is to
     be applied by first applying each relevant resultant provision to
     each avoidance arrangement and then calculating the total amount for
     the subsection.

Automatic election of relevant day
*** 13S Automatic election of relevant day ***
     (1) This section applies if a grantor grants a share or option to a
     grantee and any of the following appliesâ
          (a) the value of the grant of the share or option is not
          included in the taxable wages paid or payable by the
          grantor for a return period during which the share or
          option is granted;
          (b) the value of the taxable wages comprising the grant of
          the share or option is nil;
          (c) if the grantor were to elect to treat the day the share

          not be liable to payroll tax or the mental health levy.
     (2) If subsection (1) (a) applies, the grantor is taken to have
     elected to treat the vesting day for the share or option as the day
     on which the wages comprising the grant of the share or option are

     (3) If subsection (1) (b) or (c) applies, the grantor is taken to

Effect of rescission or cancellation of share or option
*** 13T Effect of rescission or cancellation of share or option ***
     (1) If, before the vesting day, the grant of a share or option is
     withdrawn, cancelled or exchanged for consideration other than the
     grant of other shares or optionsâ
          (a) the date of the withdrawal, cancellation or exchange is
          taken to be the vesting day for the share or option; and
          (b) despite section 13U (1) (a), the market value of the
          share or option on the vesting day is taken to be the
          amount of the consideration.
     (2) A grantor must reduce, by the relevant amount, the taxable wages
     paid or payable by the grantor for a financial year or final period,
     ifâ
          (a) the grantor included the value of a grant of a share or
          option in the taxable wages paid or payable by the grantor
          for a periodic return period falling in the financial year
          or final period; and
          (b) the grant is rescinded, during the financial year or
          final period, because the conditions of the grant were not
          met.
     (3) The commissioner must make a reassessment of a grantorâs
     liability for payroll tax and the mental health levy for a financial
     year or final period, to reduce the taxable wages of the grantor by
     the relevant amount, ifâ
          (a) the grantor included the value of a grant of a share or
          option in the taxable wages paid or payable by the grantor
          for the financial year or final period; and
          (b) the grant is rescinded, after the end of the financial
          year or final period, because the conditions of the grant
          were not met.
     (4) However, if the grantor is a non-DGE group member, subsection (3)
     applies as if a reference to making a reassessment of a grantorâs
     liability for the mental health levy were a reference to making a
     reassessment of the DGEâs liability for the mental health levy.
     (5) For subsections (2) and (3), the
     "relevant amount" is the value of the grant of a share or option
     previously included in the taxable wages of the grantor under
     subsection (2) (a) or (3) (a).
     (6) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply only because the grantee

     option is taken to be the amount equal toâ

          share or option, other than consideration in the form of
          services performed.
     (2) For subsection (1) (a), the
     "value" of a share or option isâ

                    Regulations 1997 (Cwlth), division 83A.
     (b) if paragraph (a) does not applyâthe market value of the share
     or option.
     (3) For working out the value of a share or option under subsection
     (2) (a), the regulations mentioned in that subsection apply with the
     following changesâ
          (a) the value of an option is worked out as if it were a
          right to acquire a beneficial interest in a share;
          (b) a reference to the acquisition of a beneficial interest
          in a share or right is taken to be a reference to the grant
          of a share or option;
          (c) with any other necessary changes.
     (4) In working out the market value of a share or option, anything
     that would prevent or restrict conversion of the share or option to
     money must be disregarded.
     (5) An employer must give evidence of the value of a share or option
     to the commissioner if asked by the commissioner.
     (6) If the commissioner is not satisfied with the evidence given by
     the employer under subsection (5), the commissioner may appoint a
     person to value the share or option.
     (7) If the value stated by the person appointed under subsection (6)
     is more than the value stated by the employer, the commissioner may
     claim all or part of the valuation costs from the employer.

          mentioned in paragraph (d);
          (f) the relevant percentage for the vehicle.
          Noteâ
               Under section 13ZB (5), the relevant percentage
               worked out on the basis of an averaging period
               must be used for the return periods mentioned in
               section 13ZB (6). While the employer is using
               that relevant percentage, the employer is not
               required to work out the relevant percentage
               again, or to make a new record of the details
               mentioned in subsection (2).
     (3) In relation to the return period to which the number of exempt

          return period.
     (4) If the odometer of the business vehicle is replaced or
     recalibrated during a return period for which its readings are
     relevant for using the averaging method, the employer must keep a
     record of the odometer readings immediately before and immediately
     after the replacement or recalibration.
 
Averaging methodâwhat is the averaging period
*** 13ZD Averaging methodâwhat is the averaging period ***
     (1) The
     "averaging period", for a business vehicle of an employee, means a
     continuous period of at least 12 weeks, chosen by the employer,
     throughout which the vehicle is provided or maintained by the
     employee.
     (2) The averaging period may overlap the start or end of a financial
     year.
          Noteâ
               See also section 13ZB (5) and (6) in relation to
               using a relevant percentage worked out on the
               basis of an averaging period that falls in 2
               financial years.
     (3) If the averaging method is used for more than 1 business vehicle
     of an employee for the same return period, the averaging period for
     the vehicles must be the same.
     (4) This section applies subject to section 13ZE.
 
Averaging methodârecalculation of relevant percentage
*** 13ZE Averaging methodârecalculation of relevant percentage ***
     (1) This section applies to an employer who, under section 13Z (1)
     (b), works out the number of exempt kilometres for a business vehicle
     using the averaging method.
     (2) The employer must recalculate the relevant percentage for the
     business vehicle ifâ
          (a) the commissioner gives the employer a written notice,
          before the start of a return period, directing the employer
          to recalculate the relevant percentage for the vehicle on
          the basis of an averaging period that falls wholly or
          partly during the return period; or
          (b) the employer wishes to start using the averaging method
          for 1 or more other business vehicles used by the employee.
               Noteâ
                    See also section 13ZD (3).
     (3) Also, the employer must recalculate the relevant percentage for
     the business vehicle if the employerâ
          (a) has used a relevant percentage worked out on the basis
          of an averaging period for the vehicle for the succeeding 4
          financial years after the financial year mentioned in
          section 13ZB (6) (a); and
          (b) intends to continue using the averaging method to work
          out the number of exempt kilometres for the vehicle.
          Noteâ
               If the employer recalculates the relevant
               percentage on the basis of a new averaging
               period, the new averaging period applies for the
               purposes of section 13ZB (5) and the employer
               must use the new relevant percentage for the
               return periods mentioned in section 13ZB (6).
     (4) In this sectionâ

     "recalculate" the relevant percentage for a business vehicle meansâ
          (a) record the details mentioned in section 13ZC (2) (a) to
          (e) in relation to a new averaging period for the vehicle;
          and
          (b) work out a new relevant percentage for the vehicle
          using the details mentioned in paragraph (a).
 
Averaging methodâreplacing a business vehicle
*** 13ZF Averaging methodâreplacing a business vehicle ***

     vehicle (the
     "replacement vehicle") to be the replacement of another business
     vehicle (the
     "original vehicle").
     (2) The employer must record the nomination in writingâ
          (a) during the financial year in which the nomination takes
          effect; or
          (b) if the commissioner allows the employer to record the
          nomination at a later timeâat the later time allowed by
          the commissioner.
     (3) The nomination takes effect on the day stated in it.
     (4) After the nomination takes effect, for the employerâs use of
     the averaging method the replacement vehicle is taken to be the
     original vehicle.
     (5) The employer need not repeat, for the replacement vehicle, the
     steps already taken under this subdivision for the original vehicle.
          Exampleâ
               The employer is not required to recalculate the
               relevant percentage worked out for the original
               vehicle.
     (6) The employer must keep a record ofâ
          (a) the odometer reading of the original vehicle
          immediately before the nomination takes effect; and
          (b) the odometer reading of the replacement vehicle
          immediately after the nomination takes effect.
 
Switching between continuous recording and averaging methods
*** 13ZG Switching between continuous recording and averaging methods ***
     (1) An employer may change from using a recording method to using the

                    return for the financial year.
                    2 An employer may be required, under
                    the Administration Act, to include
                    assessed interest or penalty tax in an

*** 43N Amount of final levy liability ***
     (1) This section states the employerâs liability (

     period.
     (2) The employerâs final levy liability for the final period is the
     employerâs final levy adjustment amount for the period ifâ
          (a) eitherâ
               (i) the employer (or if the employer is the DGE
               for a group, a group member) lodged, or was
               required under section 59 to lodge, a periodic
               return during the period; or
               (ii) after the last day of the final periodâ
                    (A) if the employer is not a member of
                    a groupâthe employer will be required
                    under section 59 to lodge a periodic
                    return for a periodic return period
                    that is wholly or partly within the

                    for a periodic return period that is
                    wholly or partly within the final
                    period; and
          (b) the employerâs final levy amount for the period is
          greater than the employerâs periodic levy liability
          amount for the final period.

          to lodge a periodic return during the period; and
          (b) subsection (2) does not apply.
          Exampleâ
               The amount of an employerâs final levy
               liability would be the final levy amount if the
               employer was exempt, under a certificate issued
               by the commissioner under section 62, from
               lodging periodic returns during the final period.
     (4) However, subsection (5) applies ifâ
          (a) for an employer who is not a member of a groupâ
               (i) the employer did not pay and was not liable
               to pay taxable wages or interstate wages for any
               part of the final period; and

               that, because of the nature of the employerâs
               trade or business, the taxable wages and
               interstate wages, if any, paid or payable by the
               employer fluctuate with different periods of the
               financial year; or
          (b) for an employer who is the DGE for a groupâ
               (i) the group member whose status has changed did
               not pay and was not liable to pay taxable wages
               or interstate wages for any part of the final
               period; and
               (ii) the employer satisfies the commissioner
               that, because of the nature of the group
               memberâs trade or business, the taxable wages
               and interstate wages, if any, paid or payable by
               the group member fluctuate with different periods
               of the financial year.
     (5) For working out the employerâs final levy liability for the
     final period, the commissioner mayâ
          (a) for an employer who is not a member of a group, treat
          the employerâ
               (i) if the employer has conducted the
               employerâs trade or business in Australia
               during the whole of the final periodâas an

     paid or payable by the employer for the period.
          Noteâ

     (1A) Subsection (1) does not apply for the last periodic return
     period of a financial year for the employer.
     (2) However, if the commissioner considers it would be unduly onerous
     to require the employer to lodge periodic returns within the 7-day
     period required under subsection (1), the commissioner may, by
     written notice, vary the time within which the employer is required
     to lodge returns under this section.
     (3) The commissioner may revoke a notice given under subsection (2)

          Noteâ
               Lodgement of an annual return or final return
               does not, of itself, affect a relevant
               employerâs obligation to lodge periodic
               returns.
 
Duration of periodic return period
*** 60 Duration of periodic return period ***

     periodic returns for the periods stated in the notice.
     (3) A period stated in the notice must be less than 1 year.

          (b) an employer makes a payment of periodic liability or
          periodic levy liability for a periodic return period by an
          electronic transfer of funds as required under that Act;
          and
          (c) using an approved information system, the employer
          gives the commissioner a breakdown of the payment between
          primary tax and assessed interest.
     (2) The employer is taken to have lodged a periodic return for the
     periodic return period to which the payment relates.
     (3) The amount of the payment is, for the Administration Act, section
     14 (a), taken to be the amount of the employerâs periodic liability
     and periodic levy liability stated in the return.
     (4) However, if the employer makes more than 1 payment for a periodic
     return period by the electronic transfer of funds, subsections (2)

          Noteâ
               An employer who is not required to lodge periodic
               returns is subject to a notification requirement
               under section 87 and is not exempt from the
               requirement to lodge an annual return or final
               return.
     (3) A certificate issued under subsection (1) may be either
     unconditional or subject to such conditions as are prescribed or as
     the commissioner thinks fit.
     (4) The commissioner may, at any time by notice in writing, revoke
     any certificate issued under subsection (1).
     (5) The issue of a certificate under subsection (1) shall not exempt
     an employer from the payment of any payroll tax or mental health
     levy, notwithstanding that it may have the effect of postponing the
     time for payment of any payroll tax or mental health levy.

               member of the group, by each employer who was a
               member of the group for all or part of the
               designated period; or
               (ii) for another employer, the wages that were
               paid or payable during the year by the employer,
               other than wages that were included, or required

          be lodged.
          Noteâ
               Lodgement of a final return does not, of itself,
               affect a relevant employerâs obligation to
               lodge an annual return.

Exclusion of persons from groups
*** 74 Exclusion of persons from groups ***
     (1) The commissioner may, by order in writing (an
     "exclusion order"), exclude a person from a group.
     (2) The commissioner may make an exclusion order only if the
     commissioner is satisfied a business carried on by the person is
     carried on independently of, and is not connected with the carrying
     on of, a business carried on by any other member of the group.
     (3) For deciding whether to make an exclusion order, the commissioner
     must have regard toâ
          (a) the nature and degree of ownership and control of the
          businesses carried on by the person and the other members
          of the group; and

                    Example--
                         Examplesâ
                                   1 The
                                   relevant
                                   entity has
                                   a direct
                                   interest
                                   in
                                   corporations
                                   A and B.
                                   Both
                                   corporations
                                   A and B
                                   have a
                                   direct
                                   interest
                                   in
                                   corporation
                                   C.
                                   2 The
                                   relevant
                                   entity has
                                   a direct
                                   interest
                                   in
                                   corporation
                                   A.
                                   Corporation
                                   A is
                                   linked to
                                   another
                                   corporation
                                   through
                                   more than
                                   1 chain of
                                   corporations.
     (2) A corporation is linked to the directly controlled corporation if
     the corporation is part of a chain of corporationsâ
          (a) that starts with the directly controlled corporation;
          and
          (b) in which a link is formed if a corporation has a direct
          interest in the next corporation in the chain.
          Examplesâ
                    1 A relevant entity has a direct
                    interest in corporation A (the directly
                    controlled corporation). Corporation A
                    has a direct interest in corporation B.
                    Corporations A and B are linked and
                    form part of a chain of corporations.
                    Therefore, the relevant entity has a
                    direct interest in corporation A, and
                    an indirect interest in corporation B.
                    2 Corporation B also has a direct
                    interest in corporation C. Corporations
                    B and C are linked to corporation A,
                    and corporations A, B and C form part
                    of a chain of corporations. The
                    relevant entity has a direct interest
                    in corporation A, and an indirect
                    interest in corporations B and C.
                    3 Corporation B also has a direct
                    interest in corporation D. There are
                    now 2 chains of corporations, 1
                    consisting of corporations A, B and C
                    and the other consisting of
                    corporations A, B and D. Corporations
                    B, C and D are all linked to
                    corporation A. The relevant entity has
                    a direct interest in corporation A, and
                    an indirect interest in corporations B,
                    C and D. However, if a relevant entity
                    had a direct interest in corporation C
                    only, the entity would not have an
                    indirect interest in corporation D
                    because corporation D is not linked to
                    corporation C.
     (3) The value of a relevant entityâs indirect interest in a
     corporation (the
     "indirectly controlled corporation") that is linked to a directly
     controlled corporation is the percentage worked out by multiplying
     the following amountsâ
          (a) the value of the relevant entityâs direct interest in
          the directly controlled corporation;
          (b) the value of each direct interest that forms a link in
          the chain of corporations by which the indirectly
          controlled corporation is linked to the directly controlled
          corporation.
          Examplesâ
                    1 A relevant entity has a direct
                    interest (with a value of 80%) in
                    corporation A. Corporation A has a
                    direct interest (with a value of 70%)
                    in corporation B. The value of the
                    relevant entityâs indirect interest
                    in corporation B is 80% x 70% = 56%.
                    For section 72, the relevant entity has
                    a controlling interest in corporation
                    B.
                    2 Corporation B also has a direct
                    interest (with a value of 40%) in
                    corporation C. The value of the
                    relevant entityâs indirect interest
                    in corporation C is 80% x 70% x 40% =
                    22.4%. For section 72, the relevant
                    entity does not have a controlling
                    interest in corporation C.
 
Aggregate interest
*** 74G Aggregate interest ***
     (1) A relevant entity has an
     "aggregate interest" in a corporation ifâ
          (a) the entity has a direct interest and 1 or more indirect
          interests in the corporation; or
          (b) the entity has more than 1 indirect interest in the
          corporation.
     (2) The value of a relevant entityâs aggregate interest in a
     corporation is the sum of the following amountsâ
          (a) the value of the direct interest, if any, of the entity
          in the corporation;
          (b) the value of each indirect interest of the entity in
          the corporation.
          Exampleâ
               A relevant entity has a direct interest (with a
               value of 40%) in corporation B. The relevant
               entity also has a direct interest (with a value
               of 25%) in corporation A. Corporation A has a
               direct interest (with a value of 60%) in
               corporation B. Accordingly, the relevant entity
               also has an indirect interest in corporation B
               with a value of 15% (25% x 60%). The value of the
               relevant entityâs aggregate interest in
               corporation B is 40% + 15% = 55%. For section 72,
               the relevant entity has a controlling interest in
               corporation B.
 
Designation of group member as DGE
*** 75 Designation of group member as DGE ***
     (1) The members of a group may, by an instrument in writing in the
     approved form executed by or on behalf of each member of the group
     and served on the commissioner, designate 1 of its members to be the
     DGE in respect of the group for the purposes of this Act.
     (2) If the members of a group do not in accordance with subsection
     (1) designate 1 of the members of the group to be the DGE in respect
     of the group for the purposes of this Act, the commissioner may
     exercise in respect of the group the powers of designation conferred
     on members of the group by that subsection and for the purposes of
     this Act such a designation by the commissioner shall be by
     instrument in writing served on the member of the group designated as
     the DGE and shall have the same effect and give rise to the same
     consequences as if validly made by the members of the group.
     (3) Subject to subsection (4), the DGE in respect of a group ceases
     to be the DGE in respect of that group on and from the first day of
     the periodic return period relating to the DGE during whichâ
          (a) the composition of the group alters; or
          (b) the members of the group, by an instrument in writing
          in the approved form executed by or on behalf of each of
          them who is known to the commissioner to be a member of the
          group and served on the commissioner, revoke the
          designation;
     whichever occurs the earlier.
     (4) The members of a group may exercise the power of revoking a
     designation conferred by subsection (3) only with the prior written
     consent of the commissioner or, if at the same time as revoking the
     designation, the members make a further designation of 1 of their
     members to be the DGE in substitution for the member whose
     designation is revoked.
     (5) Where the commissioner has exercised the powers conferred on the
     commissioner by subsection (2), the commissioner may, by instrument
     in writing served on the member of the group designated as the DGE,
     revoke the commissionerâs designation of that member as the DGE and
     thereafter may further exercise the powers conferred on the
     commissioner by that subsection.

This Act as a revenue law for the Administration Act
*** 104 This Act as a revenue law for the Administration Act ***
     (1) This section provides for how the Administration Act applies to
     this Act, in relation to particular liabilities, acts and omissions,
     as a revenue law under the Administration Act.
          Noteâ
               The Administration Act applies to this Act, as a
               revenue law, except to the extent its application
               is limited or modified under this section or
               section 105 or 106.
     Editorâs noteâ
          The Administration Act, section 6 (Revenue laws), declares
          this Act to be a revenue law.
     (2) The provisions of the Administration Act mentioned in subsection
     (3) do not apply in relation toâ
          (a) a pre-commencement liability; or
          (b) a liability for payroll tax for a transitional return
          period.
     (3) For subsection (2), the provisions of the Administration Act that
     do not apply are each of the followingâ
          (a) part 3 (Assessments of tax);
          (b) part 4 (Payments and refunds of tax and other amounts),
          other than sections 29, 34, 40(1)(a) and (b) and (2), 41
          and 42, division 4, division 5, subdivision 1 and sections
          49 to 53;
          (c) part 5 (Interest and penalty tax);
          (d) sections 124, 125 and 132.
     (4) To remove doubt, it is declared that the Administration Act
     applies in relation to an act or omission done or omitted to be done
     on or after the commencement, even if the act or omission relates to
     a liability mentioned in subsection (2).
          Exampleâ
               The commencement is on 1 March 2005. During an
               audit in July 2005 in relation to the 2003/2004
               financial year, a taxpayer fails to provide wage
               details for the financial year as required under
               the Administration Act, part 7. Failure to
               provide the information would be an omission
               after the commencement, even though it relates to
               a pre-commencement liability.
     (5) However, the Administration Act, sections 124, 125 and 132 do not
     apply in relation to an act or omission mentioned in subsection (4)
     if the act or omission relates to a liability mentioned in subsection
     (2).
     (6) For applying the Administration Act, part 4, in relation to a
     liability, act or omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (4)â
          (a) a liability mentioned in subsection (2)(a) or (b) is
          taken to be an assessment liability for the Administration
          Act, sections 41 and 42; and
          (b) penal tax and additional tax are not primary tax for
          the Administration Act, section 42; and
          (c) an assessment of further tax under previous part 5 is
          taken to be a reassessment for the Administration Act,
          section 46.
     (7) Subsection (4) applies subject to subsection (8).
     (8) However, to the extent this Act applies to an act or omission
     mentioned in subsection (4), the application of the Administration
     Act, section 136 is subject to previous section 38.
     (9) If, under this section, a provision of the Administration Act
     relating to a particular matter applies to this Act and this Act
     contains provision about the same matter, this Act does not apply to
     the matter.
 
Application of Administration Act, s 38
*** 105 Application of Administration Act, s 38 ***
An amount relating to a post-commencement liability may be applied under the
Administration Act, section 38, as payment for a pre-commencement liability or
a liability for payroll tax for a transitional return period.
 
Second or subsequent offences
*** 106 Second or subsequent offences ***
     (1) For applying the Administration Act, section 138 to this Act, the
     reference in subsection (1)(b) of that section to a further offence
     is a reference to an offence committed on or after the commencement.
     (2) If the Administration Act, section 138(1)(a), applies for an
     offence against a previous provision of this Act that is repealed by
     the amending Act, the reference in subsection (1)(b) of that section
     to a further offence against the provision includes a reference to an
     offence against a provision of the amended Act or the Administration
     Act that corresponds to the previous provision.
 
Application of previous provisions to particular liabilities etc.
*** 107 Application of previous provisions to particular liabilities etc. ***
     (1) Despite their amendment or repeal by the amending Act, the
     previous provisions of this Act continue to apply in relation toâ
          (a) a pre-commencement liability; and
          (b) a liability for payroll tax in relation to a
          transitional return period; and
          (c) a pre-commencement act or omission.
     (2) However, previous section 16L(5) does not apply.
     (3) Also, subsection (1) has effect subject to sections 100, 101, 103
     and 104(9).

          previous section 9(7) or 16I(4), is in effect immediately
          before the commencement.
     (2) The amount determined is, for part 2, division 3, the
     employerâs fixed periodic deduction for each periodic return period
     in the transitional year.
     (3) However, if the commissioner determines the employerâs fixed
     periodic deduction under amended section 21 or 27 on or after the
     commencement during the transitional year, the amount determined
     under the section is the employerâs fixed periodic deduction.

          (b) the commissioner determines the employerâs fixed

employers after commencement ***
     (1) This section applies to an employerâ
          (a) who is not a member of a group on the commencement; and
