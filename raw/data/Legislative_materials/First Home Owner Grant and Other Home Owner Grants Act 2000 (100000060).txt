     (1) An

          purchase of a new home in the State; or
          (b) a comprehensive home building contract made by the
          owner of land in the State, or a person who will on
          completion of the contract be the owner of land in the

          contract is made on or after 1 July 2000; or

     (2) Also, each of the following is an
     "eligible transaction" â
          (a) a contract made on or after 1 July 2000 but before 11

          homeâthe purchaser had an option to purchase the home
          granted before 1 July 2000 or the vendor had an option to
          require the purchaser to purchase the home granted before
          that date; or
          (b) for a comprehensive home building contractâeither
          party had a right or option granted before 1 July 2000 to
          require the other to enter into the contract.
     (6) Also, a transaction is not an eligible transaction if the
     consideration for the transaction is $750,000 or more.

          (b) the unencumbered value of the relevant interest in the
          land, on which the new home or other home is built or to be
          built, at the commencement date for the contract;
     is $750,000 or more.
     (8) Also, a contract mentioned in subsection (1) (b) or (2) (b) to
     have a new home or other home built on land is not an eligible
     transaction if the total of the followingâ
          (a) the consideration for the transaction;
          (b) the unencumbered value of the land at the commencement
          date for the contract;
     is $750,000 or more.

          a person who holds it subject to a trust.

     recognised at law or in equity as an interest in land.
     (4) If a person holds an interest in land on trust as guardian for a
     person under a legal disability and the interest would be a relevant
     interest if it were not for subsection (2) (b) â

          the person who holds a relevant interest in the land; and

     "unencumbered value" of property held by a person on trust as
