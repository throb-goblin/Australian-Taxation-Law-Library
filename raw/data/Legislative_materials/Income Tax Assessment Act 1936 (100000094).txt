 (15) Where:
 (a) a person has derived eligible foreign remuneration during a year of income; and
 (b) at the time of making an assessment in respect of income of the person of the year of income, the Commissioner is of the opinion that, at a later time, circumstances will exist by reason of which that eligible foreign remuneration will be exempt from tax by virtue of this section;
the Commissioner may apply the provisions of this section as if those circumstances existed at the time of making the assessment.
 (16) Where, in the making of an assessment, this section has been applied on the basis that a circumstance that did not exist at the time of making the assessment would exist at a later time and the Commissioner, after making the assessment, becomes satisfied that that circumstance will not exist, then, notwithstanding anything contained in section  170, the Commissioner may amend the assessment at any time for the purposes of ensuring that this section shall be taken always to have applied on the basis that that circumstance did not exist.

 (i) is exempt from income tax in that country; and
 (ii) would not be exempt from income tax in that country apart from the operation of an agreement applying to Australia and that other country relating to the avoidance of double taxation or of a law of that other country giving effect to such an agreement; or
 (c) the income consists of:
 (i) payments in lieu of long service leave; or
 (ii) payments by way of superannuation or pension.
 (17A) If the income of a taxpayer of a year of income consists of an amount that is exempt from tax under this section (in this section called the exempt amount) and other income, the amount of tax (if any) payable in respect of the other income is calculated using the formula:
  
where:

 (1) Where a resident, being a natural person, has been engaged in foreign service for a continuous period of not less than 91 days, any foreign earnings derived by the person from that foreign service are exempt from tax.
 (1AA) However, those foreign earnings are not exempt from tax under this section unless the continuous period of foreign service is directly attributable to any of the following:

 (b) he or she would have otherwise continued to be engaged in the foreign service; and
 (c) his or her continuous period of engagement in the foreign service would have otherwise been a period of at least 91 days.
 (2) An amount of foreign earnings derived in a foreign country is not exempt from tax under this section if the amount is exempt from income tax in the foreign country only because of any of the following:
 (a) a law of the foreign country giving effect to a double tax agreement within the meaning of Part  X;
 (b) a double tax agreement within the meaning of Part  X;
 (c) provisions of a law of the foreign country under which income covered by any of the following categories is generally exempt from income tax:

 (2A) Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to foreign earnings to the extent that the person derived them from foreign service in Iraq after 31  December 2002 but before 1 May 2004.
 (3) If the income of a taxpayer of a year of income consists of an amount that is exempt from tax under this section (in this section called the exempt amount) and other income, the amount of tax (if any) payable in respect of the other income is calculated using the formula:
  
where:
"Notional gross tax" means the number of whole dollars in the amount of income tax that would be assessed under this Act in respect of the taxpayer&#39;s taxable income of the year of income if:
 (a) the exempt amount were not exempt income; and
 (aa) if the exempt amount is a payment covered by section  83-240 or 305-65 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997--the exempt amount (excluding any part of that amount that represented contributions made by the taxpayer) were assessable income of the taxpayer; and
 (b) the taxpayer were not entitled to any rebate of tax.
"Notional gross taxable income" means the number of whole dollars in the amount that would have been the taxpayer&#39;s taxable income of the year of income if the exempt amount were not exempt income.
"Other taxable income" means the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from so much of the other income as is assessable income:
 (d) any deductions allowable to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income that relate exclusively to that assessable income; and
 (e) so much of any other deductions (other than apportionable deductions) allowable to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, may appropriately be related to that assessable income; and
 (f) the amount calculated using the formula in subsection  (4).
 (4) The formula referred to in paragraph  (3)(f) is:
  
where:
"Apportionable deductions" means the number of whole dollars in the apportionable deductions allowable to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income.
"Other taxable income" means the amount that, apart from paragraph (3)(f), would be represented by the component Other taxable income in subsection (3).
"Notional gross taxable income" means the number of whole dollars in the amount that would have been the taxpayer&#39;s taxable income of the year of income if the exempt amount were not exempt income.
 (5) Subsection (3) applies to a taxpayer in respect of income of a year of income as if any payment covered by section  83-240 or 305-65 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 that related to the termination of employment that was made in respect of the taxpayer during that year of income were income of the taxpayer of that year of income that is exempt from tax under this section.
 (6) For the purposes of this section, a period during which a person is engaged in foreign service includes any period during which the person is, in accordance with the terms and conditions of that service:
 (a) absent on recreation leave, other than:
 (i) leave wholly or partly attributable to a period of service or employment other than that foreign service;
 (ii) long service leave, furlough, extended leave or leave of a similar kind (however described); or
 (iii) leave without pay or on reduced pay; or
 (b) absent from work because of accident or illness.
 (6A) 2 or more periods in which a person has been engaged in foreign service are together taken to constitute a continuous period of foreign service until:
 (a) the end of the last of the 2 or more periods; or
 (b) a time (if any), since the start of the first of the 2 or more periods, when the person&#39;s total period of absence exceeds 1/6 of the person&#39;s total period of foreign service;
whichever happens sooner.
Example: Kate is engaged in foreign service for 20 days, is absent for 2 days and is then engaged in foreign service for 10 days. These 2 periods of foreign service constitute a continuous period of foreign service, because the total period of absence is never more than 1/10 of the total period of foreign service.
 Kate is then absent for 5 days before commencing a further period of foreign service. No matter how long the further period lasts, it can never constitute a continuous period of foreign service with the first 2 periods of foreign service, because on the fourth day of the second absence the total period of absence is 1/5 of the total period of foreign service.
 (6B) In subsection  (6A):
"total period of absence", in relation to a particular time, means the number of days, in the period starting at the start of the first of the 2 or more periods and ending at that time, for which the person was not engaged in foreign service.
"total period of foreign service", in relation to a particular time, means the number of days, in the period starting at the start of the first of the 2 or more periods and ending at that time, for which the person was engaged in foreign service.
 (6F) Where:
 (a) a person has derived foreign earnings during a year of income; and
 (b) at the time of making an assessment in respect of income of the person of the year of income, the Commissioner is of the opinion that, at a later time, circumstances will exist because of which those foreign earnings will be exempted from tax by this section;
the Commissioner may apply the provisions of this section as if those circumstances existed at the time of making the assessment.
 (7) In this section:
"employee" includes:
 (a) a person employed by a government or an authority of a government or by an international organisation; or
 (b) a member of a disciplined force.
"foreign earnings" means income consisting of earnings, salary, wages, commission, bonuses or allowances, or of amounts included in a person&#39;s assessable income under Division  83A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about employee share schemes), but does not include any payment, consideration or amount that:
 (a) is included in assessable income under Division  82 or Subdivision 83-295 or Division 301, 302, 304 or 305 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ; or
 (b) is included in assessable income under Division  82 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997; or
 (c) is mentioned in paragraph  82-135(e), (f), (g), (i) or (j) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; or
 (d) is an amount transferred to a fund, if the amount is included in the assessable income of the fund under section  295-200 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
"foreign service" means service in a foreign country as the holder of an office or in the capacity of an employee.

 (5) If the body obtains the certificate, a deduction to which this section applies is nevertheless not allowable for a year of income if the sum of all deductions to which this section applies for the year of income is less than or equal to the unfunded liability limit (see subsection  (6)) for the year of income.
 (6) If the sum is greater than that limit, so much of the deduction as is worked out using the following formula is not allowable:
  
where:
"Unfunded liability limit" for a year of income is:
 (a) if the year of income is the one in which the body ceases to be an STB--the actuarial value of the liabilities set out in the actuary&#39;s certificate; or
 (b) in any other case--that actuarial value as reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies that, because of subsection  (5), have not been allowable to the body for all previous years of income.

 (a) under a written agreement of the kind known as a securities lending arrangement, being an agreement that was entered into after 9  May 1990:
 (i) at a particular time (in this section called the original disposal time), a taxpayer (in this section called the lender) disposed of an eligible security (in this section called the borrowed security) to another taxpayer (in this section called the borrower); and

 (B) an adjustment for variations in the market value of eligible securities;
 (C) other consideration;
  a statement dissecting the notifiable consideration into those categories in such a manner as will enable the amount or value of each category to be readily ascertained; and
 (e) the lender does not dispose of (by transfer, declaration of trust or otherwise) the right to receive any part of the total consideration payable or to be given by the borrower under the agreement.
 (3A) For the purposes of paragraph  (3)(c), if, apart from this subsection, either of the following events occurred after the commencement of the borrowing period:
 (a) the making or payment of a distribution (whether in property or money) in respect of the borrowed security;
 (b) the issue, by the company, trustee, government or government authority concerned, of a right or option in respect of the borrowed security;
(even if the event occurred after the borrowed security was disposed of by the borrower to a third party), the event is taken to have occurred during the borrowing period if, and only if, (assuming that the borrower had held the borrowed security at all times during the borrowing period) the entitlement to the distribution or issue would have been attributable to the borrower&#39;s holding of the borrowed security at a particular time during the borrowing period.
 (4) In determining:
 (a) whether an amount (other than a fee payable under the securities lending arrangement) is included in the assessable income of the lender under a provision of this Act other than Part  3-1 or 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about CGT); or
 (b) whether an amount is allowable as a deduction to the lender;
in respect of either or both of the transactions covered by paragraph (3)(a), the lender is to be treated as if:
 (c) neither of those transactions had been entered into; and
 (d) the lender had held the borrowed security at all times during the borrowing period; and
 (e) if the replacement security is not the borrowed security--the replacement security were the borrowed security.
 (4A) If the lender receives a compensatory payment covered by sub -subparagraph (3)(c)(v)(C), then, in determining whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the lender under a provision of this Act other than Part  3-1 or 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the lender is to be treated as if:
 (a) the lender had held the borrowed security at all relevant times during the borrowing period; and
 (b) the right or option had been issued directly to the lender in respect of the borrowed security; and
 (c) the lender had disposed of the right or option immediately after its issue for a consideration equal to the compensatory payment.
 (4B) If the lender receives a compensatory payment covered by sub -subparagraph (3)(c)(vi)(C), then, in determining whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the lender under a provision of this Act other than Part  3-1 or 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the lender is to be treated as if:
 (a) the lender had held the right or option at all relevant times during the borrowing period; and
 (b) the lender had exercised the right or option; and
 (c) the lender had immediately disposed of the shares, units, bonds, debentures or financial instruments that resulted from exercising the right or option for a consideration equal to the compensatory payment.
 (5) In determining:
 (a) whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the borrower under a provision of this Act other than Part  3-1 or 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; or
 (b) an amount (other than a fee payable under the securities lending arrangement) is allowable as a deduction to the borrower;
in respect of either or both of the transactions covered by paragraph (3)(a):
 (c) if the borrowed security was disposed of by the borrower to a third party:
 (i) the borrower is to be treated as if the borrower had acquired the borrowed security from the lender for a consideration equal to the market value of the borrowed security at the time of its acquisition; and
 (ii) the borrower is to be treated as if the borrower had disposed of the replacement security to the lender for a consideration equal to the market value of the borrowed security at the time of its acquisition from the lender; or
 (d) in any other case--the borrower is to be treated as if neither of the transactions referred to in paragraph  (3)(a) had been entered into.
 (6) Any capital gain or capital loss from the disposal of the borrowed security by the lender is disregarded.
 (6A) If the lender acquired the borrowed security before 20  September 1985, the lender is taken (for the purposes of Parts 3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ) to have acquired the replacement security before that day.
 (6B) If the lender acquired the borrowed security on or after 20  September 1985, the first element of the cost base of the replacement security is the cost base of the borrowed security just before the acquisition of the replacement security. The reduced cost base of the replacement security is worked out similarly.
 (7) If:
 (a) the borrowed security was acquired on or after 20  September 1985; and
 (b) a CGT event (other than one involving a transaction covered by subsection  (3)) happens in relation to the replacement security at least 12 months after the lender acquired a paired security in relation to the replacement security (otherwise than under a transaction covered by subsection  (3));
section 114-10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about the requirement for 12 months ownership) does not apply to the CGT event.
 (8) For the purposes of subsection  (7):
 (a) if CGT event A1 happens (involving a transaction covered by subsection  (3)) by the lender disposing of an eligible security to the borrower, that security is a paired security in relation to the replacement security subsequently acquired or re -acquired by the lender; and
 (b) a security is a paired security in relation to a second security if the first security is a paired security in relation to a third security that is a paired security in relation to the second security (including a pairing with the second security by another application or other applications of this paragraph).
 (9) For the purpose of applying Parts  3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to the borrower:
 (a) if the borrower disposes of the borrowed security to a third party:
 (i) the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of the borrowed security (in the hands of the borrower) is taken to be its market value when the borrower acquired it; and
 (ii) when the borrower disposes of a replacement security to the lender, the capital proceeds from that CGT event are taken to be that market value; and
 (b) if no third party is involved--the transactions referred to in paragraph  (3)(a) are ignored.
 (9A) For the purpose of applying Parts  3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to the borrower, the incidental costs to the borrower of the acquisition of an eligible security covered by sub -subparagraph (3)(a)(ii)(B) include a compensatory payment incurred by the borrower (to the extent that the borrower has not deducted and cannot deduct it).
 (9B) For the purposes of the application of Parts  3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to a right or option received by the lender as mentioned in subparagraph  (3)(c)(v), the borrower and lender are to be treated as if the eligible security in respect of which the right or option was issued had been held by the lender at the time of the acquisition of the right or option.
 (9C) For the purposes of the application of Parts  3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to a share, unit, bond, debenture or financial instrument received by the lender as mentioned in subparagraph  (3)(c)(vi), the borrower and the lender are to be treated as if:
 (a) the share, unit, bond, debenture or financial instrument had been received as the result of the exercise of the borrowed security; and
 (b) the borrowed security had been held by the lender at the time of the exercise; and
 (c) the lender had exercised the borrowed security; and
 (d) the lender had exercised the borrowed security at the time the direction concerned was given; and
 (e) the amount of the contribution (if any) made by the lender to the borrower in respect of the carrying out of the direction were an amount paid as consideration by the lender in respect of the exercise.
 (9D) If a distribution covered by subparagraph  (3)(c)(i) consists of one or more shares issued by a company to the borrower or to a third party in the circumstances mentioned in subsection 6BA(1), then, for the purposes of the application of Parts  3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to a share (in this subsection called the notional bonus share) received by the lender in relation to the distribution in the circumstances mentioned in sub -subparagraph (3)(c)(iv)(A) or (B), the borrower and the lender are to be treated as if:
 (a) the company had issued the notional bonus share to the lender instead of the borrower or the third party, as the case requires; and
 (b) the notional bonus share had been issued in the circumstances mentioned in subsection  6BA(1); and
 (c) the notional bonus share had been issued in respect of the borrowed security; and
 (d) the lender had held the borrowed security at the time the notional bonus share was issued.
 (9E) If a distribution covered by subparagraph  (3)(c)(i) consists of one or more units issued by the trustee of a unit trust to the borrower or to a third party in the circumstances covered by section  130-20 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, then, for the purposes of the application of Parts  3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to a unit (in this subsection called the notional bonus unit) received by the lender in relation to the distribution in the circumstances mentioned in sub-subparagraph (3)(c)(iv)(A) or (B), the borrower and the lender are to be treated as if:
 (a) the trustee had issued the notional bonus unit to the lender instead of the borrower or the third party, as the case requires; and
 (b) the notional bonus unit had been issued in the circumstances covered by section  130-20 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; and
 (c) the notional bonus unit had been issued in respect of the borrowed security; and
 (d) the lender had held the borrowed security at the time the notional bonus unit was issued.
 (9F) If the lender receives a compensatory payment covered by sub -subparagraph (3)(c)(v)(C), then, for the purposes of the application of Parts 3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to the lender, the lender is to be treated as if:
 (a) the lender had held the borrowed security at all relevant times during the borrowing period; and
 (b) the right or option had been issued directly to the lender in respect of the borrowed security; and
 (c) the lender had disposed of the right or option immediately after its issue and had received capital proceeds of an amount equal to the compensatory payment.
 (9G) If the lender receives a compensatory payment covered by sub -subparagraph (3)(c)(vi)(C), then, for the purposes of the application of Parts 3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to the lender, the lender is to be treated as if:
 (a) the lender had held the right or option at all relevant times during the borrowing period; and
 (b) the lender had exercised the right or option; and
 (c) the lender had immediately disposed of the shares, units, bonds, debentures or financial instruments that resulted from exercising the right or option and had received capital proceeds of an amount equal to the compensatory payment.
 (11A) If:
 (a) the lender receives from the borrower a distribution or identical property covered by subparagraph  (3)(c)(iv); and
 (b) assuming that the borrowed security had continued to be held by the lender, an amount (in this subsection called the otherwise assessable amount) would have been included in the lender&#39;s assessable income of a year of income in respect of the distribution concerned;
the lender&#39;s assessable income of the year of income includes an amount equal to the otherwise assessable amount.
 (11B) If:
 (a) the lender receives from the borrower a compensatory payment covered by sub -subparagraph (3)(c)(iv)(C); and
 (b) assuming that the borrowed security had continued to be held by the lender, an amount (in this subsection called the otherwise assessable amount) would have been included in the lender&#39;s assessable income of a year of income in respect of the distribution concerned;
the lender&#39;s assessable income of the year of income includes an amount equal to the otherwise assessable amount.
 (12) Where:
 (a) a taxpayer has entered into a transaction of a kind referred to in subparagraph  (3)(a)(i); and
 (b) at the time of making an assessment in respect of income of the taxpayer of the year of income in which the transaction occurred, the Commissioner is of the opinion that, at a later time, circumstances will exist because of which this section will apply in connection with that transaction;
the Commissioner may apply the provisions of this section as if those circumstances existed at the time of making the assessment.
 (13) Where:
 (a) in the making of an assessment, this section has been applied on the basis that a circumstance that did not exist at the time of making the assessment would exist at a later time; and
 (b) after the making of the assessment, the Commissioner becomes satisfied that the circumstance will not exist;
then, in spite of anything in section 170, the Commissioner may amend the assessment at any time for the purpose of ensuring that this section is to be taken always to have applied on the basis that the circumstance did not exist.

 (ii) all non-share dividends paid to the shareholder by the company; and

 (ii) non-share dividends that are paid to the shareholder by the company and are attributable to the permanent establishment, to the extent to which they are derived from sources outside Australia.
This subsection does not apply to a dividend (or non-share dividend) to the extent to which another provision of this Act that expressly deals with dividends includes some or all of the dividend (or non -share dividend) in, or excludes some or all of the dividend (or non-share dividend) from, the shareholder&#39;s assessable income.
Note 1: Some other provisions that expressly deal with dividends are sections 23AI, 23AK and 128D of this Act and section  768-5 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
Note 2: An amount declared to be conduit foreign income is not included in assessable income under paragraph  (1)(b) or (c): see section 802-15 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.

 (a) the amount of the moneys or of the value of other property of which a dividend paid by a company consists is debited against an amount standing to the credit of a share capital account of the company; or
 (b) a dividend paid by a company is a repayment by the company of an amount paid -up on a share;
the dividend shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been paid by the company out of profits derived by it.
 (2) Subsections (3) and (4) apply to a demerger dividend unless the head entity elects in writing, within one month after it decides which of its shareholders will receive ownership interests in the demerged entity under the demerger, that those subsections do not apply to the total demerger dividend for all shareholders.
 (3) This section applies to the demerger dividend as if it had not been paid out of profits.
 (4) A demerger dividend is not assessable income or exempt income.
 (5) However, subsections  (3) and (4) do not apply to a demerger dividend unless, just after the demerger, CGT assets owned by the demerged entity or a demerger subsidiary representing at least 50% by market value of all the CGT assets (or a reasonable approximation of market value) owned by the demerged entity and its demerger subsidiaries are used, directly or indirectly, in one or more businesses carried on by one or more of those entities.
 (6) In applying subsection  (5), disregard any assets that are ownership interests in a demerger subsidiary unless they are used in a business referred to in that subsection.

 (4) If a debt/equity swap occurs and the taxpayer later disposes of any of the shares or units or they are cancelled or redeemed:
 (a) except in accordance with paragraph  (b), no amount is included in, or allowable as a deduction from, the taxpayer&#39;s assessable income of any year of income under this Act in respect of the later disposal, cancellation or redemption; and

 (i) under section  8-1 or 25-35 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in respect of the writing off of the whole or part of a debt as bad; or
 (ii) under section 63E of this Act in respect of a debt/equity swap relating to the whole or part of a debt; and

 (b) if paragraph (ka), (oa) or (wa) of the definition of relevant expenditure in subsection (1) covers the expenditure--the taxpayer deducting or being able to deduct, or not deducting or not being able to deduct, as appropriate, an amount under Division  40 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 for an item of intellectual property for a year of income because the taxpayer&#39;s adjustable value of the item would be calculated under that Division  by reference to the relevant expenditure; and
 (d) in any other case--a deduction being allowed or allowable or not being allowed or allowable, as the case may be, to the taxpayer in respect of the relevant expenditure.
 (1B) For the purposes of the application of the definition of expected tax saving in subsection (1) in relation to an amount of eligible relevant expenditure incurred by a taxpayer:
 (a) where:
 (i) if a tax benefit were not allowable in respect of any part of that eligible relevant expenditure, a person (whether the taxpayer or another person and whether in the capacity of a trustee of a trust estate or otherwise) would be liable to pay income tax in respect of a year of income; and
 (ii) if a tax benefit or tax benefits were allowable under this Act in respect of that eligible relevant expenditure, that person would be liable to pay a lesser amount of income tax in respect of that year of income;
  the amount by which the amount of the tax referred to in subparagraph  (i) exceeds the amount of the tax referred to in subparagraph (ii) is a tax saving amount; and
 (b) where:
 (i) if a tax benefit were not allowable in respect of any part of that eligible relevant expenditure, a person (whether the taxpayer or another person and whether in the capacity of a trustee of a trust estate or otherwise) would be liable to pay income tax in respect of a year of income; and
 (ii) if a tax benefit or tax benefits were allowable under this Act in respect of that eligible relevant expenditure, that person would not be liable to pay income tax in respect of that year of income;
  the amount of the tax referred to in subparagraph  (i) is a tax saving amount.
 (1BA) In the application of subsection  (1B) in determining whether there is a tax saving amount in relation to an amount of eligible relevant expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in a case where, if a tax benefit or tax benefits were allowable in respect of that eligible relevant expenditure, a person (whether the taxpayer or another person and whether in the capacity of a trustee of a trust estate or otherwise) would:
 (a) have a tax loss for a year of income that the person would not have; or
 (b) have a greater tax loss for a year of income than the person would have;
if a tax benefit were not allowable in respect of any part of that eligible relevant expenditure, apply Division 36 and former Subdivision  375-G of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as if the amount were relevant expenditure but not eligible relevant expenditure.
 (1D) Subject to subsection  (1E), where, in respect of any 2 or more amounts of eligible relevant expenditure (whether incurred by one taxpayer or by 2 or more taxpayers and whether incurred in one year of income or in 2 or more years of income), the following conditions are satisfied, namely:
 (a) if subsection (1B) were applied in relation to one of those amounts of eligible relevant expenditure in relation to a person (whether or not that person is the person or one of the persons who incurred the eligible relevant expenditure) in relation to a year of income on the assumption that no tax benefit is or was allowable in respect of any part of the other amount of eligible relevant expenditure, or in respect of any part of any of the other amounts of eligible relevant expenditure, as the case may be, the tax saving amount determined in accordance with that subsection would be greater than the tax saving amount that would be determined in accordance with that subsection in relation to that amount of eligible relevant expenditure in relation to that person in relation to that year of income if that subsection were applied on the assumption that a tax benefit or tax benefits were allowable under this Act in respect of the other amount of eligible relevant expenditure, or in respect of each of the other amounts of eligible relevant expenditure, as the case may be; and
 (b) if paragraph (a) of this subsection were applied in relation to that person in relation to that year of income in relation to the other amount of eligible relevant expenditure, or in relation to each of the other amounts of eligible relevant expenditure, as the case may be, the condition specified in that paragraph would be satisfied in relation to that other amount or in relation to each of those other amounts, as the case may be;
then, in the application of subsection (1B) in calculating the tax saving amount in relation to that person in relation to the year of income in relation to any one of the amounts of eligible relevant expenditure first referred to in this subsection, it shall be assumed that no tax benefit is or was allowable in respect of any part of the other of those amounts or in respect of any part of any of the other of those amounts, as the case may be.
 (1E) Where:
 (a) but for this subsection, subsection  (1D) would apply to require it to be assumed, for the purposes of the application of subsection (1B) in relation to an amount of eligible relevant expenditure, that no tax benefit is or was allowable in respect of any part of another amount of eligible relevant expenditure (in this subsection referred to as the allowable relevant expenditure); and
 (b) section 82KL does not and will not operate to deem a tax benefit not to be allowable and never to have been allowable in respect of any part of the allowable relevant expenditure;
subsection (1D) shall not apply and shall be taken never to have applied so as to require it to be assumed, in the application of subsection (1B) in relation to an amount of eligible relevant expenditure other than the allowable relevant expenditure, that no tax benefit is or was allowable in respect of any part of the allowable relevant expenditure.
 (1F) For the purposes of this Subdivision, an amount of relevant expenditure incurred by a taxpayer shall be taken to be an amount of eligible relevant expenditure if:
 (a) that amount of relevant expenditure was incurred after 24  September 1978 by reason of, as a result of or as part of a tax avoidance agreement entered into after that date;
 (b) by reason of, as a result of or as part of the tax avoidance agreement the taxpayer has obtained, in relation to that relevant expenditure being incurred, a benefit or benefits in addition to:

Value of shares

 (1) For the purposes of section  82SA, the value of a fully paid share as at the valuation date is:
 (a) where:
 (i) the share is included in a class of shares that, during the whole of the relevant valuation period, was listed for quotation in the official list of a stock exchange that was a prescribed stock exchange during the whole of that period, or in the official lists of 2 or more stock exchanges each of which was a prescribed stock exchange during the whole of that period; and
 (ii) fully paid shares included in that class of shares were recorded by that stock exchange, or by one or more of those stock exchanges, as the case may be, as having been sold during that period;

Income and deductions of partner

 (1) The assessable income of a partner in a partnership shall include:
 (a) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the net income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was a resident; and
 (b) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the net income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was not a resident and is also attributable to sources in Australia.
 (2) Subject to section  830-45 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, if a partnership loss is incurred by a partnership in a year of income, there shall be allowable as a deduction to a partner in the partnership:
 (a) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the partnership loss as is attributable to a period when the partner was a resident; and
 (b) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the partnership loss as is attributable to a period when the partner was not a resident and is also attributable to sources in Australia.
 (2AA) However, if:
 (a) the partner is a limited partner in a partnership; and
 (b) the partnership is a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP during the year of income;
the amount allowable under subsection (2), in respect of the year of income, as a deduction must not exceed the amount worked out as follows:
Method statementStep 1. Work out the sum of the amounts that the partner has contributed (the partner&#39;s contribution) to the partnership.Step 2. Subtract the sum of all the amounts (if any) of the partner&#39;s contribution that are repaid to the partner.Step 3. Subtract the sum of all deductions allowed to the partner for losses of the partnership in previous years of income.Step 4. Subtract the sum of the amounts of all the debt interests issued by the partner to the extent that they are secured by the partner&#39;s interest in the partnership.
Example: A limited partner contributes $100,000 to a VCLP, having borrowed $80,000. Because the lender values the partner&#39;s interest in the partnership at $70,000, the partner also provides, as additional security, other assets valued at $10,000.
 If none of the partner&#39;s contribution has been repaid and the partner has not been allowed deductions for partnership losses in previous years of income, the amount allowable to the partner for a partnership loss cannot exceed $30,000.
 (2A) Subsection (2) does not apply to a partnership loss if the partner&#39;s interest in the partnership at the end of the year of income is:
 (a) a segregated exempt asset (as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) of a life assurance company; or
 (b) a segregated current pension asset (as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) of a complying superannuation fund.
 (3) The exempt income of a partner in a partnership shall include:
 (a) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the exempt income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was a resident; and
 (b) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the exempt income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was not a resident and is also attributable to sources in Australia.
 (4) The non-assessable non -exempt income of a partner in a partnership shall include:
 (a) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the non -assessable non-exempt income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was a resident; and
 (b) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the non -assessable non-exempt income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was not a resident and is also attributable to sources in Australia.

Deductions in respect of outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amounts

 (1) If:
 (a) the partner is a limited partner in a partnership; and
 (b) the partnership is a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP during the year of income; and
 (c) the amount allowable under subsection  92(2) as a deduction to the partner for partnership losses incurred by the partnership in the year of income is not reduced because of subsection 92(2AA); and
 (d) the partner has an outstanding subsection  92(2AA) amount for the year of income;
there is allowable as a deduction to the partnership an amount worked out as follows:
Method statementStep 1. Subtract the amount allowable under subsection  92(2) as a deduction to the partner for partnership losses incurred by the partnership in the year of income from the amount worked out using the method statement in subsection  92(2AA).Step 2. If the amount worked out under step 1 is greater than or equal to the outstanding subsection  92(2AA) amount for the year of income, the amount of the deduction allowable under this section is the outstanding subsection  92(2AA) amount.Step 3. If the amount worked out under step 1 is less than the outstanding subsection  92(2AA) amount for the year of income, the amount of the deduction allowable under this section is the amount worked out under step 1.
 (2) The partner has an outstanding subsection  92(2AA) amount for a year of income if:
 (a) an amount allowable under subsection  92(2) as a deduction to the partner for partnership losses incurred by the partnership in a previous year of income was reduced because of subsection 92(2AA); and
 (b) the difference between:
 (i) the sum of all reductions made under subsection  92(2AA) to amounts allowable under subsection 92(2) as deductions to the partner for partnership losses incurred by the partnership in previous years of income; and
 (ii) the sum of all amounts allowable under this section, in respect of previous years of income, as deductions to the partner in relation to those reductions;
  is greater than zero.
The amount of that difference is the partner&#39;s outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amount for the year of income.
 (3) To avoid doubt, a partner&#39;s outstanding subsection  92(2AA) amount for a year of income cannot form part of a tax loss for the purposes of Division 36 or 160 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 .

Partner not having control and disposal of share in partnership income

 (1) Subject to this section, where:
 (a) a share in the net income of a partnership of a year of income is included in the assessable income of a partner in the partnership, not being:
 (i) a company;
 (ii) a person in the capacity of a trustee; or
 (iii) a person who was under the age of 18 years on the last day of the year of income of the person that corresponds with the year of income of the partnership; and
 (b) the partnership is so constituted or controlled, or its operations are so conducted, that the partner has not the real and effective control and disposal of that share or of a part of that share;
this section applies to that share or that part of that share, as the case may be.
 (2) Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, where:
 (a) a partnership is so constituted or controlled, or its operations are so conducted, that a partner in the partnership, being a trustee of a trust estate, has not the real and effective control and disposal of his or her share in the net income of the partnership of a year of income or of a part of that share (which share or part of a share, as the case may be, is in this subsection referred to as uncontrolled partnership income); and
 (b) in calculating in accordance with section 95 the net income of that trust estate or of any other trust estate, there is included in the assessable income of the trust estate any uncontrolled partnership income;
then:
 (c) if:
 (i) a beneficiary, not being a company or a person who was under the age of 18 years on the last day of the year of income of the person that corresponds with the year of income of the partnership, is presently entitled to the whole of the income of the trust estate otherwise than in the capacity of a trustee; or
 (ii) there is no part of the net income of the trust estate that is included in the assessable income of a beneficiary in pursuance of section  97 or in respect of which the trustee is assessed and liable to pay tax in pursuance of section  98;
  this section applies to the portion of the net income of the trust estate that was derived from uncontrolled partnership income;
 (d) if a beneficiary, not being a company or a person who was under the age of 18 years on the last day of the year of income of the person that corresponds with the year of income of the partnership, is presently entitled to a share of the income of the trust estate otherwise than in the capacity of a trustee, this section applies to so much of that share of the net income of the trust estate as bears to that share the same proportion as the portion of the net income of the trust estate that was derived from uncontrolled partnership income bears to the net income of the trust estate; and
 (e) if there is a part of the net income of the trust estate that is not included in the assessable income of a beneficiary in pursuance of section  97 and in respect of which the trustee is not assessed and is not liable to pay tax in pursuance of section  98, this section applies to so much of that part of the net income of the trust estate as bears to that part the same proportion as the portion of the net income of the trust estate that was derived from uncontrolled partnership income bears to the net income of the trust estate.
 (5) For the purposes of this section:
 (a) where:
 (i) the assessable income of a trust estate includes the net income or a share of the net income of another trust estate; and
 (ii) the assessable income of the other trust estate by reference to which that net income is calculated included income of a particular class (including an amount that is to be deemed by an application or applications of this paragraph to be income of a particular class);
  the assessable income of the first -mentioned trust estate shall be deemed to include income of that class of an amount equal to so much of the net income or share of the net income of the other trust estate that is included in the assessable income of the first -mentioned trust estate as bears to that net income or share of that net income the same proportion as the portion of the net income of the other trust estate that was derived from income of that class bears to the net income of the other trust estate; and
 (b) the portion of the net income of a trust estate that is derived from income of a particular class that is included in the assessable income of the trust estate is the amount remaining after deducting from the income of that class that is included in the assessable income of the trust estate:
 (i) any prescribed deductions that relate exclusively to that income of that class;
 (ii) so much of any other prescribed deductions (other than apportionable deductions) as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, may appropriately be related to that income of that class; and
 (iii) the amount that bears to the prescribed deductions (being apportionable deductions) the same proportion as the amount that, but for this subparagraph, would be the portion of the net income of the trust estate that is derived from that income of that class bears to the sum of the net income of the trust estate and those last -mentioned prescribed deductions.
 (6) Where the assessable income of a trust estate includes, or, by virtue of paragraph (5)(a), is to be deemed to include, income of a particular class but the Commissioner is of the opinion that it would be unreasonable to treat each part or share of the net income of the trust estate that is included in the assessable income of a beneficiary, or on or in respect of which the trustee is assessed and liable to pay tax, as including a proportionate part of the portion of the net income of the trust estate that is derived from income of that class, the amount:
 (a) that is the amount of a part or share of the net income of the trust estate to which this section applies by virtue of paragraph  (2)(d) or (e); or
 (b) that is, by virtue of paragraph  (5)(a), the amount of the income of that class that is to be deemed to be included in the assessable income of another trust estate;
is, in lieu of the amount that, but for this subsection, would be the amount of that part or share of that net income or the amount of that income of that class, as the case may be, such amount as the Commissioner considers reasonable in the circumstances.
 (8) Where the Commissioner is of the opinion that, by reason of special circumstances, it would be unreasonable that this section should apply to any income, this section does not apply to that income.
 (8A) In forming an opinion for the purposes of subsection  (8) as to whether it is unreasonable that this section should apply in relation to any of the net income of a trust estate, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the extent (if any) to which that net income represents income to which a beneficiary is presently entitled that is attributable to a period when the beneficiary was not a resident and is also attributable to sources out of Australia.
 (9) Where the assessable income of a taxpayer, other than a taxpayer in the capacity of a trustee, includes income to which this section applies, the taxpayer shall be assessed and is liable to pay further tax, in accordance with subsection  (10A) or (10B), upon the portion (in this section referred to as the eligible portion) of his or her taxable income that is derived from income to which this section applies.
 (10) For the purposes of subsection (9), the portion of the taxable income of a taxpayer that is derived from income to which this section applies is the amount remaining after deducting from the income to which this section applies that is included in his or her assessable income:
 (a) any deductions allowed or allowable in his or her assessment that relate exclusively to the income to which this section applies that is included in his or her assessable income;
 (b) so much of any other deductions allowed or allowable in his or her assessment (other than apportionable deductions) as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, may appropriately be related to the income to which this section applies that is included in his or her assessable income; and
 (c) the amount that bears to the apportionable deductions allowed or allowable in his or her assessment the same proportion as the amount that, but for this paragraph, would be the portion of his or her taxable income that is derived from income to which this section applies bears to the sum of his or her taxable income and those apportionable deductions.
 (10A) Where Division 392 (Long -term averaging of primary producers&#39; tax liability) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 does not apply in relation to the income of a taxpayer of the year of income, the taxpayer is liable to pay further tax upon the eligible portion of his or her taxable income at the rate declared by the Parliament to be the rate of further tax payable in pursuance of subsection  (9) in respect of the relevant part of the taxable income.

Corporate limited partnerships

 (1) For the purposes of this Division, a limited partnership is a corporate limited partnership in relation to a year of income of the partnership if:
 (a) the year of income is the 1995 -96 year of income or a later year of income; or
 (b) the partnership was formed on or after 19  August 1992; or
 (c) both:
 (i) the partnership was formed before 19  August 1992; and
 (ii) the partnership does not pass the continuity of business test set out in section  94E; or
 (d) all of the following apply:
 (i) the partnership was formed before 19  August 1992;
 (ii) a change in the composition of the partnership occurs during the period:
 (A) beginning on 19  August 1992; and
 (B) ending at the end of the year of income;
 (iii) the partners do not elect, in accordance with section  94F, that the partnership is not to be treated as a corporate limited partnership in relation to the year of income.
 (2) However, a partnership that is a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a venture capital management partnership cannot be a corporate limited partnership.
Note 1: This subsection can apply without the partnership meeting the applicable registration requirements under the Venture Capital Act 2002. It must be registered under that Act in order to be a VCLP, an ESVCLP or an AFOF, but it is possible for it to remain registered while the requirements are not met.
Note 2: VCLPs, ESVCLPs, AFOFs and VCMPs are taxed as ordinary partnerships under Division 5.
Note 3: If the partnership&#39;s registration as a VCLP, ESVCLP or AFOF is unconditional, some partners&#39; share in capital gains and losses from CGT events relating to some investments may be disregarded: see Subdivision  118-F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (3) A venture capital management partnership is a limited partnership that:
 (a) is a general partner of one or more of the following:
 (i) one or more VCLPs;
 (ia) one or more ESVCLPs;
 (ii) one or more AFOFs; and
 (b) only carries on activities that are related to being such a general partner.
A limited partnership ceases to be a venture capital management partnership if it ceases to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b).
Note: In this Act, the term &quot;venture capital management partnership&quot; is usually abbreviated to &quot;VCMP&quot;.
 (4) The place of residence of a VCMP is the place at which the partnership has its central management and control.
 (5) A limited partnership that is a foreign hybrid limited partnership in relation to a year of income because of subsection  830-10(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is not a corporate limited partnership in relation to the year of income.
Note: As result, both the normal partnership provisions and special provisions relating to foreign hybrid limited partnerships will apply to the entity.
 (6) If, for the purpose of applying this Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in relation to a partner&#39;s interest in a limited partnership, the partnership is a foreign hybrid limited partnership in relation to a year of income because of subsection  830-10(2) of that Act, the partnership is not a corporate limited partnership in relation to the partner&#39;s interest in relation to the year of income.
Note: As result, both the normal partnership provisions and special provisions relating to foreign hybrid limited partnerships will apply to the entity, but only in relation to the partner&#39;s interest.

Continuity of business test

  In determining whether a limited partnership is a corporate limited partnership in relation to a year of income, the partnership passes the continuity of business test if, and only if:
 (a) at all times during the period:
 (i) beginning on 19  August 1992; and
 (ii) ending at the end of the year of income;

Simplified outline of the relationship between this Division, Division 6E and Subdivisions 115 - C and 207 - B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

  The following is a simplified outline of the relationship between this Division, Division  6E and Subdivisions 115-C and 207-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 .
This Division sets out the basic income tax treatment of the net income of the trust estate. Generally: (a) it has the result of assessing beneficiaries on a share of the net income of the trust estate based on their present entitlement to a share of the income of the trust estate; and (b) it has the result of assessing the trustee directly on any residual net income; and (c) as a collection mechanism, it has the result of assessing the trustee in respect of some beneficiaries, such as non-residents or those under a legal disability.If the trust estate has capital gains, franked distributions or franking credits, this basic treatment is modified as described below.Division 6E modifies the operation of this Division  for the purpose of excluding amounts relevant to capital gains, franked distributions and franking credits from the calculations of assessable amounts under sections 97, 98, 99, 99A and 100.Division 6E does not modify the operation of this Division  (or any other provision of this Act) for any other purpose. For example: (a) it does not modify the operation of this Division for the purposes of applying section 100A; and (b) it does not modify amounts taxed in the hands of the trustee under Subdivisions 115-C and 207-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.Subdivisions 115-C and 207-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 provide the corresponding taxation treatment for those capital gains, franked distributions and franking credits. Specifically: (a) Subdivision 115-C of that Act has the effect that an amount corresponding to each of those capital gains is taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries of the trust (as a capital gain) and, if necessary, assessed to the trustee. (b) Subdivision 207-B of that Act has the effect that an amount corresponding to each of those franked distributions is taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries of the trust and, if necessary, the trustee. It also has the effect that the entity in whose hands those distributions are taxed can take advantage of the relevant amount of related franking credits.

 (2) For the purposes of a provision of this Act (other than a provision mentioned in subsection  (5)), treat the amount of the increase as being an amount in respect of which the trustee is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 98 in respect of the beneficiary&#39;s interest in or share of the net income of the trust estate.
 (3) Subsection (4) applies if an amount in respect of which a trustee of a trust estate is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section  99 or 99A is increased because of Subdivision  115-C or 207-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (4) For the purposes of a provision of this Act (other than a provision mentioned in subsection  (5)), treat the amount of the increase as being an amount in respect of which the trustee is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 99 or 99A in respect of the net income of the trust estate.
 (5) The provisions are as follows:
 (a) sections 97, 98A (other than subsection  98A(2)) and 100 (other than subsections 100(2) and (3));

Interpretation

 (1) In this Division:
"adjusted Division 6 percentage", of an entity that is a beneficiary or trustee of a trust estate, means the entity&#39;s Division  6 percentage of the income of the trust estate calculated on the assumption that the amount of a capital gain or franked distribution to which any beneficiary or the trustee of the trust estate is specifically entitled were disregarded in working out the income of the trust estate.
"adjusted net income", in relation to a trust estate, has the meaning given by subsection 100AB(4).
"Division 6 percentage":
 (a) a beneficiary of a trust estate has a Division 6 percentage of the income of the trust estate equal to the share (expressed as a percentage) of the income of the trust estate to which the beneficiary is presently entitled; and
 (b) the trustee of a trust estate has a Division 6 percentage of the income of the trust estate equal to the share (expressed as a percentage) of the income of the trust estate to which no beneficiary is presently entitled.
However, if the income of a trust estate is nil:
 (c) a beneficiary of a trust estate has a Division 6 percentage of the income of the trust estate of 0%; and
 (d) the trustee of a trust estate has a Division 6 percentage of the income of the trust estate of 100%.
"exempt income", in relation to a trust estate, means the exempt income of the trust estate calculated as if the trustee were a taxpayer who was a resident.
Note: See also Division 54 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (in particular, the provisions in section 54-70 about trusts), which provides a tax exemption for certain payments under structured settlements and structured orders.
"net income", in relation to a trust estate, means the total assessable income of the trust estate calculated under this Act as if the trustee were a taxpayer in respect of that income and were a resident, less all allowable deductions, except deductions under Division  393 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Farm management deposits) and except also, in respect of any beneficiary who has no beneficial interest in the corpus of the trust estate, or in respect of any life tenant, the deductions allowable under Division  36 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in respect of such of the tax losses of previous years as are required to be met out of corpus.
A trust may be required to work out its net income in a special way by Division 266 or 267 in Schedule 2F to this Act or Division  275 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
"non-assessable non-exempt income", in relation to a trust estate, means the non-assessable non-exempt income of the trust estate calculated as if the trustee were a taxpayer who was a resident.
"specifically entitled" has the same meaning as in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (2) For the purposes of this Division, a trust estate shall be taken to be a resident trust estate in relation to a year of income if:
 (a) a trustee of the trust estate was a resident at any time during the year of income; or
 (b) the central management and control of the trust estate was in Australia at any time during the year of income.
 (3) In this Division, a trust estate that is not a resident trust estate in relation to a year of income is referred to as a non -resident trust estate in relation to that year of income.

Modifications for special disability trusts

 (1) This Division  applies with the modifications set out in this section in relation to a year of income in relation to a trust estate that is a special disability trust at the end of the year of income.
 (2) Treat the principal beneficiary of the trust estate as being presently entitled to all of the income of the trust estate of the year of income.
 (3) If the principal beneficiary of the trust estate is a resident of Australia at the end of the year of income treat that person as being under a legal disability throughout the year of income.
 (4) If there is no income of the trust estate assume that:
 (a) there is income of the trust estate of the year of income; and
 (b) the principal beneficiary of the trust estate is presently entitled to all of the income of the trust estate of the year of income.
 (5) If the amount to be deducted under subsection  100(2) from the income tax assessed against the principal beneficiary is greater than the amount of the income tax assessed against the principal beneficiary, the Commissioner must pay to the principal beneficiary an amount equal to the difference between those 2 amounts.
Note: The tax offset is subject to the refundable tax offset rules: see section  67-23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.

 (ii) an amount (the taxed component) in respect of which the trustee of an AMIT is assessed and liable to pay tax (the paragraph 276-105(2)(c) tax) because of paragraph  276-105(2)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (3) A proportion of the subsection  98(4) tax or of the paragraph 276-105(2)(c) tax (as applicable) is to be deducted from the income tax assessed against the beneficiary of the year of income. That proportion is the same as the proportion of the taxed net income or of the taxed component (as applicable) that gave rise to the assessable amount.
Note: To work out the proportion of the taxed net income that gives rise to assessable income for a beneficiary of another trust estate, you would have regard to the share of the income of each interposed trust estate to which a beneficiary (including a beneficiary in the capacity of a trustee) is presently entitled.
Example: The P Trust has two non-resident trustee beneficiaries, the trustees of the S Trust and the H Trust. Each trustee is presently entitled to a 1/2 share of the income of the P Trust. The net income of the P Trust is $100,000. The trustee of the P Trust pays tax of $22,500 under subsection  98(4) in respect of the trustee of the S Trust&#39;s interest and $22,500 under subsection  98(4) in respect of the trustee of the H Trust&#39;s interest.
 The S Trust has a non-resident beneficiary, G, who is presently entitled to a 1/3 share of the income of the S Trust. The net income of the S Trust is $30,000. Subsection  98A(3) includes $10,000 in G&#39;s assessable income.
 The taxed net income of the P trust is $50,000. The proportion of that taxed net income that gave rise to the $10,000 being included in G&#39;s assessable income is 1/3.This is because G had a 1/3 share of the income of the S Trust. $7,500 (1/3 x $22,500) is deducted from the income tax assessed against G.
 If section 97, subsection 98A(3) or section 100 also includes amounts in the assessable income of any beneficiaries of the H Trust, each of those beneficiaries also works out the amount of the deduction against the income tax assessed against them in the same way.
 (4) If the amount to be deducted under subsection  (3) is greater than the amount of the income tax assessed against the beneficiary, the Commissioner must pay to the beneficiary an amount equal to the difference between those 2 amounts.
Note: See Division 3A of Part IIB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 for the rules about how the Commissioner must pay the entity. Division 3A of Part IIB allows the Commissioner to apply the amount owing as a credit against tax debts that the entity owes to the Commonwealth.

 (a) if the non-resident trust estate is not a listed country trust estate in relation to the year of income--the net income of the non -resident trust estate of the year of income; or
 (b) if the non-resident trust estate is a listed country trust estate in relation to the year of income--the amount that would have been the net income of the non -resident trust estate of the year of income if the exempt income of the trust estate included all income and profits of the trust estate, other than eligible designated concession income in relation to any listed country in relation to the year of income;
reduced by:
 (c) so much (if any) of the amount covered by paragraph  (a) or (b) as represents:
 (i) an amount:
 (A) that is or has been included in the assessable income of a beneficiary under section  97; or
 (B) in respect of which the trustee of the non -resident trust estate is or has been assessed and liable to pay tax under section 98, 99 or 99A; or

 (iii) an amount that consists of, or is attributable to, the franked part of a distribution, or the part of a distribution that has been franked with an exempting credit; or
 (v) if an amount is or has been included in the assessable income of any taxpayer under section  102AAZD because the taxpayer is an attributable taxpayer in relation to any year of income (in this subparagraph called the taxpayer&#39;s year of income) and in relation to a trust estate other than the non-resident trust estate--so much of an amount paid to the trustee of the non -resident trust estate as represents the attributable income of that other trust estate of the taxpayer&#39;s year of income; or
 (vii) if:
 (A) an attribution account payment is made to the trustee of the trust estate during the year of income; and
 (B) the making of the attribution account payment gives rise to an attribution debit, in relation to any taxpayer, for the entity making the payment;

 (2) The attributable income of a resident trust estate of a year of income is 0.
 (3) For the purposes of sub -subparagraph (1)(c)(ii)(A), a beneficiary is to be taken to be a resident of a listed country if, and only if, the beneficiary is treated as a resident of the listed country for the purposes of the tax law of the listed country.
 (4) If the tax law of a listed country adopts some criterion other than treatment as a resident as the criterion for applying a worldwide source tax base to a beneficiary, then, subsection  (3) has effect, in relation to that tax law, as if that criterion were the same as treatment as a resident of the listed country for the purposes of that tax law.
 (5) For the purposes of this section, where, because of section  101, a beneficiary is presently entitled to a particular amount, the amount is taken to have been paid to the beneficiary.
 (6) For the purposes of this section, the extent to which an amount referred to in subparagraph  (1)(c)(i) or (ii) (in this subsection called the taxed amount) represents the amount covered by paragraph  (1)(b) (in this subsection called the listed country trust amount) is calculated using the formula:
  
where:

What this Division is about

 (1) The main purpose of this Division  is to ensure that the trustee of a closely held trust with one or more trustee beneficiaries that are presently entitled to a share of the income or of a tax-preferred amount of the trust advises the Commissioner soon after the end of the year of income of certain details about those trustee beneficiaries. This will allow the Commissioner to check whether the assessable income of the trustee beneficiaries includes the correct share of net income, and whether the net assets of the trustee beneficiaries reflect the receipt of the tax -preferred amounts.
 (2) To achieve this purpose, the Division:
 (a) provides for the trustee to correctly identify the trustee beneficiaries within a specified period after the end of the year of income; and
 (b) if the trustee fails to do so, provides for taxation at a penalty rate (in the case of net income) or offences under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (in the case of tax-preferred amounts).
 (3) This Division also provides that, where the trustee of the closely held trust becomes presently entitled to an amount that is reasonably attributable to the whole or a part of the share of the net income of the closely held trust, there will also be taxation at a penalty rate.

 (a) a transfer of property shall be deemed to be the payment of an amount equal to the value of the property; and
 (b) a reference to an associated person, in relation to a company, is a reference to:
 (i) a person who is, or has been, a shareholder in, or director of, the company; or

Simplified outline of this Division

  The following is a simplified outline of this Division:
This Division treats 3 kinds of amounts as dividends paid by a private company:&bull;  amounts paid by the company to a shareholder or shareholder&#39;s associate (see section 109C);&bull;  amounts lent by the company to a shareholder or shareholder&#39;s associate (see sections 109D and 109E);&bull;  amounts of debts owed by a shareholder or shareholder&#39;s associate to the company that the company forgives (see section 109F).This treatment makes the amounts assessable income of the shareholder or associate (under section  44).However, some payments, loans and forgiven debts are not treated as dividends. (See Subdivisions C and D.) Also, this Division  does not apply to demerger dividends. (See Subdivision DA.)An amount may be treated as a dividend even if it is paid or lent by the company to the shareholder or associate through one or more interposed entities. (See Subdivision  E.)An amount may also be included in the assessable income of a shareholder or shareholder&#39;s associate if: (a) a company has an unpaid present entitlement to income of a trust; and (b) the trustee makes a payment or loan to, or forgives a debt of, the shareholder or associate.(See Subdivisions EA and EB.)If the total of the amounts is more than the company&#39;s distributable surplus, only the part of the total equal to the distributable surplus is treated as dividends. (See section  109Y.)This Division applies to non-share equity interests and non -share dividends in the same way it applies to shares and dividends.

Application of Division to non - share dividends

  This Division:
 (a) applies to a non-share equity interest in the same way as it applies to a share; and
 (b) applies to an equity holder in the same way as it applies to a shareholder; and
 (c) applies to a non-share dividend in the same way as it applies to a dividend.

Application of Division to closely - held corporate limited partnerships

  This Division applies to a corporate limited partnership in relation to a year of income in the same way as it applies to a private company in relation to a year of income, if, any time during the year of income:
 (a) the partnership has fewer than 50 members; or
 (b) any entity has, directly or indirectly, and for the entity&#39;s own benefit, an entitlement to a 75% or greater share of the income or capital of the partnership.
Example: Michael has an entitlement to an 80% share of the income of 2 fixed trusts. The 2 fixed trusts have, between them, an entitlement to 100% of the income of a corporate limited partnership. For the purposes of paragraph  (b), Michael has, indirectly, and for his own benefit, an entitlement to a 75% or greater share of the income of the partnership.

Application of Division to non - resident companies

 (1) This Division  applies, in relation to a payment, loan or debt forgiveness, in relation to a private company that is a non-resident as if:
 (a) references in this Division  to a year of income of the company were references to a tax accounting period in relation to the company in relation to a foreign tax imposed by a tax law of:
 (i) if the company is a resident of only one foreign country--that foreign country; or
 (ii) otherwise--the foreign country to which subsection  (2) applies; and
 (b) references in this Division  to the lodgment day for the year of income were references to the due date for lodgment of the company&#39;s return of income for the tax accounting period under that tax law.
 (2) For the purposes of subparagraph  (1)(a)(ii), this subsection applies to a foreign country (the relevant country) if:
 (a) the company is a resident of the relevant country; and
 (b) of all the tax accounting periods:
 (i) in relation to the company in relation to the foreign taxes imposed by the tax laws of the foreign countries of which the company is resident; and
 (ii) during which the payment, loan or debt forgiveness is made;
  the tax accounting period under the tax law of the relevant country ends first; and
 (c) if more than one of the tax accounting periods mentioned in paragraph  (b) end first--the due date for lodgment of the company&#39;s return of income for the tax accounting period under the tax law of the relevant country is not later than the due date for lodgment for any of the other tax accounting periods that end first.
 (3) In this section:
"tax accounting period" has the meaning given by section 317.
"tax law" has the meaning given by section 317.
Note: Section 109L prevents amounts from being included in assessable income under this Division  if the amounts are included in, or excluded from, assessable income under another provision of this Act, such as the rules relating to CFCs and FIFs.

Payments treated as dividends

When private company is taken to pay a dividend
 (1) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of the private company&#39;s year of income if the private company pays an amount to the entity during the year and either:
 (a) the payment is made when the entity is a shareholder in the private company or an associate of such a shareholder; or
 (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the payment is made because the entity has been such a shareholder or associate at some time.
Note 1: Some payments do not give rise to dividends under Subdivision D. This section also does not give rise to a dividend if the amount is paid to a CGT concession stakeholder under subsection  152-325(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (see subsection  152-325(11)).
Note 2: A private company is treated as making a payment to a shareholder or shareholder&#39;s associate if an interposed entity makes a payment to the shareholder or associate. See Subdivision  E.
Amount of dividend
 (2) The dividend is taken to equal the amount paid, subject to section  109Y.
Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division  to the company&#39;s distributable surplus.
What is a payment to an entity?
 (3) In this Division, payment to an entity means:
 (a) a payment to the extent that it is to the entity, on behalf of the entity or for the benefit of the entity; and
 (b) a credit of an amount to the extent that it is:
 (i) to the entity; or
 (ii) on behalf of the entity; or
 (iii) for the benefit of the entity; and
 (c) a transfer of property to the entity.
Note: See also section 109CA (Payment includes provision of asset).
Loans are not payments
 (3A) However, a loan to an entity is not a payment to the entity.
Note: Payments converted to loans before the private company&#39;s lodgment day are treated as loans (see subsection  109D(4A)).
Value of payment by transfer of property
 (4) The amount of a payment consisting of a transfer of property is the amount that would have been paid for the transfer by parties dealing at arm&#39;s length less any consideration given by the transferee for the transfer. (The amount of a payment is nil if the consideration given by the transferee equals or exceeds the amount that would have been paid at arm&#39;s length for the transfer.)

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109CA
Payment includes provision of asset

 (1) In this Division, payment to an entity includes the provision of an asset for use by the entity.
Note: This includes provision under a lease or licence.
Example: Yacht builder Mainbrace Enterprises Pty Ltd owns a yacht for the purpose of sales demonstrations. With the private company&#39;s permission, one of its shareholders uses the yacht on weekends. The company has made a payment to the shareholder, unless one of the exceptions to subsection  (1) applies.
 (2) The time the payment is made is the time the entity first:
 (a) uses the asset with the permission of the provider of the asset; or
 (b) has a right to use the asset (whether alone or together with other entities), at a time when the provider of the asset does not have a right:
 (i) to use the asset; or
 (ii) to provide the asset for use by another entity.
Example: Paragraph (a) could apply if a shareholder were driving a company car with the company&#39;s permission. Paragraph  (b) could apply if the shareholder had the car parked at his or her house or at another place of his or her choosing.
 (3) However, if the use or right continues into another income year of the entity, treat the provision of the asset for use in the other income year as being a separate payment made at the start of that year.
Exceptions
 (4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the provision of the asset would, if done in respect of the employment of an employee, be a minor benefit under section  58P of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 .
 (5) Subsection (1) does not apply to the extent that, if the entity had incurred and paid expenditure in respect of the provision of the asset, a once -only deduction would have been allowable to the entity in respect of the expenditure, ignoring Divisions  28 (Car expenses) and 900 (Substantiation rules) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (6) Subsection (1) does not apply to the provision of a dwelling, if:
 (a) the entity, or an associate of the entity, carries on a business; and

  land, water or a building for the purpose of carrying on the business; and
 (c) the provision of the dwelling to the entity is connected with that use or with that lease, licence or other right.
Note: For the meaning of land, see section  2B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
 (7) Subsection (1) does not apply to the provision of a dwelling, if:
 (a) the dwelling is the main residence of the entity; and
 (b) the provider of the dwelling is a private company; and
 (c) the private company acquired the dwelling before 1  July 2009; and
 (d) the private company would meet the conditions in section  165-12 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (which is about the company maintaining the same owners) if, despite subsection  165-12(1), the ownership test period were the period:
 (i) starting on the start of 1  July 2009; and
 (ii) ending at the time of payment, worked out under subsection  (2) of this section.
 (7A) Subsection (1) does not apply to the provision of a dwelling to the entity if:
 (a) the dwelling is a flat or home unit that is part of a complex of 2 or more flats or home units; and
 (b) the provider of the dwelling is a company that owns a legal or equitable interest in the land on which the complex is erected; and
 (c) there is more than one share in the company, and each share (whether singly or as part of a parcel of shares) gives the relevant shareholder the right to occupy a flat or home unit in the complex; and
 (d) each flat or home unit in the complex is covered by a share, or a parcel of shares, in the company; and
 (e) the dwelling is provided to the entity because a shareholder holds such a share, or parcel of shares; and
 (f) the company does not have legal or equitable interests in any assets other than legal or equitable interests in:
 (i) the complex, and the land on which it is erected; and
 (ii) any related land and buildings; and
 (iii) any related plant, machinery, equipment, furniture or fittings; and
 (iv) any assets relating to the matters mentioned in paragraph  (g); and
 (g) the assessable income of the company is derived predominantly from:
 (i) managing and maintaining the complex (including the assets mentioned in subparagraphs  (f)(i), (ii) and (iii)); and
 (ii) interest and dividends relating to income derived from managing and maintaining the complex (including the assets mentioned in those subparagraphs).
 (7B) Subsection (7A) does not apply in a case to which Subdivision  E (about interposed entities) applies, if the company mentioned in that subsection is interposed between:
 (a) a private company; and
 (b) a shareholder, or an associate of a shareholder, of the private company.
 (8) Section 118-120 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Extension to adjacent land) applies in relation to subsections  (6) to (7A) of this section in the same way as it applies in relation to Subdivision 118-B of that Act.
 (9) Subsection (1) does not apply if the provision of the asset to the entity is a transfer of property to the entity.
Note: For transfers of property, see paragraph 109C(3)(c).
Value of payment
 (10) Subject to subsection  (11), the amount of the payment is:
 (a) the amount that would have been paid for the provision of the asset by the parties dealing at arm&#39;s length; less
 (b) any consideration given for the provision of the asset by the entity.
 (11) The amount of the payment is nil if the consideration given by the entity equals or exceeds the amount that would have been paid at arm&#39;s length for the provision of the asset.

 (a) an advance of money; and
 (b) a provision of credit or any other form of financial accommodation; and
 (c) a payment of an amount for, on account of, on behalf of or at the request of, an entity, if there is an express or implied obligation to repay the amount; and

Amalgamated loan from a previous year treated as dividend if minimum repayment not made

Amalgamated loan treated as dividend in first year in which payment is less than minimum yearly repayment
 (1) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of one of the private company&#39;s years of income (the current year) if:
 (a) the private company made an amalgamated loan to the entity in an earlier year of income; and
 (b) the amalgamated loan is not repaid at the end of the current year; and
 (c) the amount (if any) paid to the private company during the current year in relation to the amalgamated loan falls short of the minimum yearly repayment of the amalgamated loan worked out under subsection  (5) for the current year; and
 (d) section 109Q does not apply in relation to the current year.
Note: The amalgamated loan does not give rise to a dividend for that year if the minimum yearly repayment is not made and the entity satisfies the Commissioner that treating the loan as a dividend would cause hardship. See section  109Q.
Amount of dividend
 (2) The amount of the dividend is taken to be the amount of the shortfall mentioned in paragraph  (1)(c), subject to section 109Y.
Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division  to the company&#39;s distributable surplus.
What is an amalgamated loan?
 (3) For the purposes of this Division, a private company is taken to make a loan (the amalgamated loan) to a single entity during a year of income if the private company makes one or more loans (constituent loans) to the entity during the year, each of which:
 (a) is not fully repaid before the lodgment day for the year; and
 (b) would cause the company to be taken under section  109D to pay a dividend to the entity at the end of the year, apart from section 109N; and
 (c) has the same maximum term for the purposes of that section.
The amount of the amalgamated loan is the sum of the amounts of the constituent loans that have not been repaid before the lodgment day for the year of income in which the amalgamated loan is made.
 (3A) Subsection (3B) applies if:
 (a) a private company is taken to have made an amalgamated loan (the old amalgamated loan) during a year of income (the original year of income); and
 (b) the maximum term of the old amalgamated loan under subsection  109N(3) was 7 years; and
 (c) in a later year of income (the later year of income):
 (i) a constituent loan taken account of by the old amalgamated loan becomes secured by a mortgage over real property; and
 (ii) the term of the constituent loan is extended; and
 (d) as a result of the mortgage, the maximum term of the constituent loan under subsection  109N(3) is 25 years; and
 (e) the term of the constituent loan after the extension (including the period before the extension during which the constituent loan was in existence) does not exceed 25 years.
 (3B) For the purposes of this Division  in relation to the later year of income and subsequent years of income:
 (a) treat the constituent loan as a new amalgamated loan that takes account of that constituent loan; and
 (b) treat the new amalgamated loan as having been made just before the start of the later year of income; and
 (c) treat the amount of the new amalgamated loan just before the start of the later year of income as the amount of the constituent loan that had not been repaid at that time; and
 (d) unless paragraph (e) applies--reduce the amount of the old amalgamated loan just before the start of the later year of income by the amount of the new amalgamated loan at that time; and
 (e) if the constituent loan was the only constituent loan taken account of by the old amalgamated loan--disregard the old amalgamated loan.
Payments in relation to constituent loans treated as payments in relation to amalgamated loan
 (4) For the purposes of this Division, a payment to the private company in relation to a constituent loan in a year of income after the one in which the constituent loan was made is taken to be a payment in relation to the amalgamated loan that takes account of the constituent loan.
Minimum yearly repayment
 (5) The minimum yearly repayment of an amalgamated loan for a year of income is the amount worked out using the formula in subsection  (6). However, the minimum yearly repayment of an amalgamated loan for a year of income is the amount worked out under the regulations, if they provide for working it out.
Formula for minimum yearly repayment
 (6) The formula for the minimum yearly repayment for a year of income is:
  
where:
"current year&#39;s benchmark interest rate" is the benchmark interest rate for the year of income for which the minimum yearly repayment is being worked out.
"remaining term" is the difference between:
 (a) the number of years in the longest term of any of the constituent loans that the amalgamated loan takes account of; and
 (b) the number of years between the end of the private company&#39;s year of income in which the loan was made and the end of the private company&#39;s year of income before the year of income for which the minimum yearly repayment is being worked out;
rounded up to the next higher whole number if the difference is not already a whole number.
Note: Section 109R provides that certain payments relating to a loan are not to be taken into account for the purposes of working out the minimum yearly repayment.
Benchmark interest rate used to work out how much of a payment relating to amalgamated loan is a repayment
 (7) Work out the amount of an amalgamated loan repaid by the end of a year of income on the basis that interest is payable on the balance of the loan from time to time in a year of income at a rate equal to the benchmark interest rate for the year of income.

Forgiven debts treated as dividends

Forgiven debt treated as dividend
 (1) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of the private company&#39;s year of income if all or part of a debt the entity owed the private company is forgiven in that year and either:
 (a) the amount is forgiven when the entity is a shareholder in the private company, or an associate of such a shareholder; or
 (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the amount is forgiven because the entity has been such a shareholder or associate at some time.
Note: In some cases forgiving a debt does not give rise to a dividend. See section 109G.
Amount of dividend
 (2) The amount of the dividend equals the amount of debt forgiven, subject to section  109Y.
Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division  to the company&#39;s distributable surplus.
When is a debt forgiven?
 (3) An amount of a debt is forgiven for the purposes of this Division if and when the amount would be forgiven under section 245-35 or 245 -37 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, assuming the amount were a debt to which Subdivisions 245-C to 245 -G of that Act apply.
Note: Division 245 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 applies to forgiveness of certain commercial debts.
Discharge of debt by transfer of property is not forgiveness
 (4) Despite subsection  (3), an amount of debt is not forgiven for the purposes of this Division if the obligation to pay the amount is discharged by a payment to the creditor consisting of a transfer of property.
Note: Subsection 109C(4) explains how to work out the value of a payment consisting of a transfer of property.
Debt forgiveness by debt parking
 (5) An amount of debt an entity (the debtor) owes a private company is also forgiven for the purposes of this Division  if:
 (a) the private company assigns the right to receive payment of the amount to another entity (the new creditor) who is either:
 (i) an associate of the debtor; or
 (ii) a party to an arrangement with the debtor about the assignment; and
 (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the new creditor will not exercise the assigned right.
Debt forgiveness by failure to rely on obligation to pay
 (6) An amount of debt an entity (the debtor) owes a private company is also forgiven for the purposes of this Division if a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the private company will not insist on the entity paying the amount or rely on the entity&#39;s obligation to pay the amount. (The amount is forgiven when a reasonable person would first reach that conclusion.)
Forgiveness of amalgamated loan debt
 (7) If a private company forgives an amount of debt resulting from a constituent loan taken into account in working out the amount of an amalgamated loan under subsection  109E(3), the private company is taken to forgive the same amount of the debt resulting from the amalgamated loan.
This section operates on only the earliest debt forgiveness
 (8) If the same debt is forgiven for the purposes of this Division  at different times under different provisions of this section, this section operates on the first forgiveness only.
Example: Subsection (3) of this section provides that a debt is forgiven if it has not been paid by the time a statute of limitations prevents recovery of the debt. (It does this by applying paragraph  245-35(b) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 .) The debt might already have been forgiven under subsection (6) of this section (because a reasonable person would have concluded earlier that the private company was not going to insist on payment). This section would apply to the forgiveness under subsection  (6) but not the forgiveness under subsection (3).

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109G
Debt forgiveness that does not give rise to a dividend

Forgiveness of debt owed by company generally not treated as dividend
 (1) A private company is not taken under this Division  to pay a dividend because a debt owed to it by another company is forgiven.
Note: This does not apply to a debt owed by a company as trustee. (See section 109ZE.)
Forgiveness of debts under Bankruptcy Act not treated as dividends
 (2) A private company is not taken under this Division  to pay a dividend because a debt is forgiven because the debtor becomes a bankrupt or because of Part X of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 .
Forgiveness of loan debt does not give rise to dividend if loan gives rise to dividend under section 109D
 (3) A private company is not taken under section  109F to pay a dividend at the end of a year of income because of the forgiveness of an amount of a debt resulting from a loan if, because of the loan, the private company is taken:
 (a) under section 109D to pay a dividend at the end of that year or an earlier one; or
 (b) under former subsection  108(1) to pay a dividend on the last day of that year or an earlier one.
Reduced dividend for forgiveness of loan debt if loan causes dividend under section 109E
 (3A) Subsection (3B) applies if:
 (a) a private company is taken under section  109F to pay a dividend at the end of a year of income because of the forgiveness of an amount of a debt resulting from a loan; and
 (b) the private company is taken under section  109E to pay a dividend at the end of an earlier year of income in relation to the loan.
 (3B) The amount of the dividend mentioned in paragraph  (3A)(a) is reduced by the amount of the dividend mentioned in paragraph (3A)(b) (but not below zero).
Note: There may be more than one reduction under this subsection if the private company has been taken under section  109E to pay more than one dividend in relation to the loan.
Commissioner may treat forgiveness as not giving rise to dividend
 (4) A private company is not taken under this Division  to pay a dividend because of the forgiveness of a debt owed by an entity if the Commissioner is satisfied that:
 (a) the debt was forgiven because payment of the debt would have caused the entity undue hardship; and
 (b) when the entity incurred the debt, the entity had the capacity to pay the debt; and
 (c) the entity lost the ability to pay the debt in the foreseeable future as a result of circumstances beyond the entity&#39;s control.

Simplified outline of this Subdivision

  The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision:
This Subdivision sets out rules about payments and loans that are not treated as dividends.The following sorts of payments are not treated as dividends:&bull;  payments of genuine debts (section 109J);&bull;  payments to other companies (section 109K);&bull;  payments that are otherwise assessable or that are specifically excluded from assessable income (section 109L).The following sorts of loans are not treated as dividends:&bull;  loans to other companies (section 109K);&bull;  loans that are otherwise assessable (section 109L);&bull;  loans made in the ordinary course of business on ordinary commercial terms (section 109M);&bull;  loans that meet criteria for minimum interest rate and maximum term (section 109N);&bull;  certain loans and distributions by liquidators (section 109NA);&bull;  loans that are for the purpose of funding the purchase of certain ESS interests under an employee share scheme (section 109NB).An amalgamated loan may not be treated as a dividend if the Commissioner is satisfied that doing so would cause undue hardship. (See section  109Q.)This Subdivision also provides for some loan repayments and interest payments to private companies to be disregarded if they are made with the intention of borrowing a similar amount from a private company later. (See section  109R.)

Simplified outline of this Subdivision

  The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision:
This Subdivision allows a private company to be taken under Subdivision  B to pay a dividend to an entity (the target entity) if an entity interposed between the private company and the target entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity under an arrangement involving the private company.This result is achieved by treating the private company as making a payment or loan of an amount determined by the Commissioner to the target entity (according to whether the interposed entity made a payment or loan to the target entity). (See sections  109V (for payments) and 109W (for loans).)The arrangement must involve the private company and one or more interposed entities in making payments or loans or giving loan guarantees for the purpose of the target entity receiving a payment or loan from an interposed entity. (See sections  109T, 109U and 109UA.)If the target entity repays a fraction of the loan made by the interposed entity, the target entity is treated as repaying the same fraction of the loan taken to have been made by the private company. (See subsection  109W(3).)Some provisions that prevent payments or loans from giving rise to dividends do not apply to payments or loans this Subdivision  treats a private company as making. (See section 109X.)

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109T
Payments and loans by a private company to an entity through one or more interposed entities

 (1) This Division  operates as if a private company makes a payment or loan to an entity (the target entity) as described in section  109V or 109W if:
 (a) the private company makes a payment or loan to another entity (the first interposed entity) that is interposed between the private company and the target entity; and
 (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the private company made the payment or loan solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving a payment or loan to the target entity; and
 (c) either:
 (i) the first interposed entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity; or
 (ii) another entity interposed between the private company and the target entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity.
This section operates regardless of certain factors
 (2) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:
 (a) whether the interposed entity made the payment or loan to the target entity before, after or at the same time as the first interposed entity received the payment or loan from the private company; or
 (b) whether or not the interposed entity paid or lent the target entity the same amount as the private company paid or lent the first interposed entity.
This section does not operate if the payment or loan to the first interposed entity is treated as a dividend
 (3) This Division does not operate as described in subsection  (1) (and sections 109V and 109W) if the private company is taken under Subdivision B (as it applies apart from this Subdivision) to pay a dividend as a result of the payment or loan to the first interposed entity.

Payments and loans through interposed entities relying on guarantees

 (1) This Division  operates as if a private company makes a payment to an entity (the target entity) as described in section 109V if:
 (a) during a year of income the private company guarantees a loan made by another entity (the first interposed entity); and
 (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the private company gave the guarantee solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving a payment or loan to the target entity; and
 (c) either:
 (i) the first interposed entity that is a private company makes a loan to the target entity; or
 (ii) another entity that is a private company interposed between the private company and the target entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity; and
 (d) the amount of the payment or the loan is greater than the amount worked out using the formula:
  
 (2) The amount of the payment from the private company to the target entity (as worked out under section  109V) is to be reduced by the amount worked out using the formula:
  
 (3) In the formulas in paragraph  (1)(d) and subsection (2):
"distributable surplus" means the distributable surplus (worked out under subsection 109Y(2)) for the interposed entity that made the payment or loan to the target entity for the year of income.
"subsection 109Y(3) amount" means the total of any amounts calculated under subsection  109Y(3) in relation to that interposed entity for the year of income (apart from as a result of the operation of this section).
This section operates regardless of certain factors
 (4) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:
 (a) whether the interposed entity made the payment or loan to the target entity before, after or at the same time as the first interposed entity received the guarantee from the private company; or
 (b) whether or not the interposed entity paid or lent the target entity the same amount as the private company guaranteed.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109UA
Certain liabilities under guarantees treated as payments

 (1) Section 109T operates as if one entity (the first entity) makes a payment to a second entity if the first entity guarantees a loan the second entity makes to a third entity (the target entity) and, as a result of the guarantee, the first entity has a liability (other than a contingent liability) to make a payment to the second entity.
Example: A private company guarantees a loan that a bank makes to a shareholder in the private company and the shareholder defaults on the loan. As a result, the company has a presently existing liability to make a payment to the bank. Section  109T operates as if the private company had made a payment to the bank, so the company is treated by section  109V as making a payment to the shareholder (because the bank is interposed between company and shareholder).
 (2) The amount of the payment (as worked out under section  109V) is to be reduced by any amount treated as a dividend as a result of the operation of section 109U in relation to the payment or loan made by the interposed entity to the target entity.
 (3) A private company is not taken under this Division  to pay a dividend because of the operation of subsection (1) in relation to a guarantee if the Commissioner is satisfied that:
 (a) the target entity would suffer undue hardship if the private company were taken to pay a dividend to the entity because of the liability; and
 (b) when the target entity entered into the loan, the entity had the capacity to pay the loan.
 (4) This section does not the limit the operation of section  109T.
 (5) Subsection (1) does not apply if:
 (a) as a result of the first entity&#39;s liability mentioned in that subsection, the target entity has a liability (other than a contingent liability) to make a payment to the first entity; and
 (b) because of section  109N, the liability to make a payment to the first entity is not treated under this Division as giving rise to a dividend paid to the first entity.

Amount of private company&#39;s payment to target entity through one or more interposed entities

Private company taken to pay if target entity is paid
 (1) If the target entity is paid an amount by the interposed entity, this Division  operates as if the private company had paid the amount (if any) determined by the Commissioner to the target entity when the interposed entity paid the target entity.
Determining the amount of the private company&#39;s payment
 (2) In determining the amount of the payment the private company is taken to have made, the Commissioner must take account of:
 (a) the amount the interposed entity paid the target entity; and
 (b) how much (if any) of that amount the Commissioner believes represented consideration payable to the target entity by the private company or any of the interposed entities for anything (assuming that the consideration payable equals that for similar transactions at arm&#39;s length).

- SECT 109W
Private company&#39;s loan to target entity through one or more interposed entities

Private company taken to lend if target entity receives loan
 (1) If the target entity is lent an amount by the interposed entity, this Division  operates as if the private company had made a loan (the notional loan) of the amount (if any) determined by the Commissioner to the target entity when the interposed entity made the loan to the target entity.
Note: Subsection 109D(4) specifies the time at which a loan is made.
How big is the notional loan?
 (2) In determining the amount of the notional loan, the Commissioner must take account of:
 (a) the amount the interposed entity lent the target entity; and
 (b) how much (if any) of that amount the Commissioner believes represented consideration payable to the target entity by the private company or any of the interposed entities for anything (assuming that the consideration payable equals that for similar transactions at arm&#39;s length).
Notional repayments of notional loan
 (3) When working out whether the private company is taken under section  109D to pay a dividend as a result of the notional loan, and the amount of any such dividend, assume that the target entity repays an amount of the notional loan equal to the amount worked out using the formula:
  
where:
"amount actually lent to target entity" is the amount the interposed entity lent to the target entity.
"repayment made by target entity to lender" is the amount of any repayment made by the target entity of the loan the interposed entity made to the target entity.

Operation of Subdivision D in relation to payment or loan

Payment or loan not affected by being made through interposed entity
 (1) Despite sections  109K and 109L, a private company may be taken under section 109C or 109D to pay a dividend as a result of this Subdivision treating the private company as making a payment or loan to an entity (the target entity), even if:
 (a) the private company is treated that way because it makes a payment or loan to an entity that is a company interposed between the private company and the target entity; or
 (b) some or all of the amount paid or lent by a private company to an entity interposed between the private company and the target entity is included in the interposed entity&#39;s assessable income for a year of income.
 (2) Subsections (3) and (4) apply if a notional loan arises under section  109W because an entity interposed between the private company and the target entity makes a loan (the actual loan ) to the target entity.
 (3) For the purposes of section  109N, treat the agreement under which the actual loan was made as the agreement under which the notional loan was made.
 (4) For the purposes of section  109E:
 (a) treat the notional loan as an amalgamated loan from the private company to the target entity; and
 (b) treat the amount of the notional loan worked out under subsection  109W(1) as the amount of the amalgamated loan; and
 (c) treat the agreement under which the actual loan was made as the agreement under which the amalgamated loan was made; and
 (d) treat repayments by the target entity of the amount of the notional loan worked out under subsection  109W(3) as payments by the target entity to the private company in relation to the amalgamated loan.

 (2) Section 109XB applies if:
 (a) a trustee makes a loan (including a loan through an interposed entity as described in section  109XG) to a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder of a private company (except a shareholder or associate that is a company) (the actual transaction); and
 (b) either:
 (i) the company is presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the trust estate at the time the actual transaction takes place, and the whole of that amount has not been paid to the company before the earlier of the due date for lodgment and the date of lodgment of the trustee&#39;s return of income for the trust for the year of income of the trust in which the actual transaction takes place; or
 (ii) the company becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the trust estate after the actual transaction takes place, but before the earlier of the due date for lodgment and the date of lodgment of the trustee&#39;s return of income for the trust for the year of income of the trust in which the actual transaction takes place, and the whole of the amount has not been paid to the company before the earlier of those dates.
Note: For entitlements through interposed trusts, see section 109XI.
Forgiven debts
 (3) Section 109XB applies if:
 (a) all or part of a debt owed to a trustee by a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder of a private company is forgiven (except where the shareholder or associate is a company) (the actual transaction); and
 (b) either:
 (i) the company is presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the trust estate at the time the actual transaction takes place, and the whole of that amount has not been paid to the company before the earlier of the due date for lodgment and the date of lodgment of the trustee&#39;s return of income for the trust for the year of income of the trust in which the actual transaction takes place; or
 (ii) the company becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the trust estate after the actual transaction takes place, but before the earlier of the due date for lodgment and the date of lodgment of the trustee&#39;s return of income for the trust for the year of income of the trust in which the actual transaction takes place, and the whole of the amount has not been paid to the company before the earlier of those dates.
Note: For entitlements through interposed trusts, see section 109XI.
Amount involved in the actual transaction
 (4) The amount involved in the actual transaction is the lesser of:
 (a) the amount actually involved in the actual transaction; and
 (b) the amount worked out using the formula:
  
where:
"previous transactions" means the sum of:
 (a) the amounts that, because of previous applications of section  109UB (as in force before the commencement of this section) have been taken to be loans; and
 (b) the amounts that, because of previous applications of this Subdivision, have been included in an entity&#39;s assessable income;
in relation to the unpaid present entitlement.
"unpaid present entitlement" means:
 (a) in a case mentioned in subparagraph  (1)(c)(i), (2)(b)(i) or (3)(b)(i)--the amount of the present entitlement that remained unpaid on the earlier of the dates mentioned in that subparagraph; and
 (b) in a case mentioned in subparagraph  (1)(c)(ii), (2)(b)(ii) or (3)(b)(ii)--the amount of the present entitlement that remained unpaid on the earlier of the dates mentioned in that subparagraph.
The amount of the actual transaction where the entitlement is only partly attributable to an unrealised gain
 (5) For the purposes of subsection  (4), where the actual transaction was a payment and that payment was only partly attributable to an amount that is an unrealised gain, the amount of the actual transaction is taken to be the amount of the payment that was attributable to the amount that is the unrealised gain.
Creation of a present entitlement is not a payment
 (6) The creation of a present entitlement to the capital or income of a trust estate is not, of itself, a payment for the purposes of this Subdivision.
Meaning of unrealised gain
 (7) In this section:
"unrealised gain", in relation to a trust estate and an actual payment, means any unrealised gain, whether of a capital or income nature, but does not include an unrealised gain to the extent that it has been or would be included in the assessable income of the trust, apart from this Division, for:
 (a) a year of income before the year in which the actual payment was made; or
 (b) the year of income in which the actual payment was made; or
 (c) the year of income following the year in which the actual payment was made.

Amounts included in assessable income

 (1) An amount is included, as if it were a dividend paid by the company at the end of the year of income of the company in which the actual transaction took place, in the assessable income of the shareholder or associate referred to in subsection  109XA(1), (2) or (3) if:
 (a) had the actual transaction been done by a private company (the notional company); and
 (b) had the shareholder or associate been a shareholder of the notional company at the time the actual transaction took place;
an amount (the Division 7A amount) would have been included in the shareholder&#39;s or associate&#39;s assessable income because of a provision of this Division  outside this Subdivision.
 (2) Subject to section  109Y, the amount that is included under subsection (1) is the Division 7A amount.

Modifications

Modifications for this Subdivision only
 (1) The modifications in this section have effect for the purposes of the operation of this Subdivision.
General modifications
 (2) This Division (but not this Subdivision) applies to an actual transaction done by a trustee of a trust estate with these modifications:
 (a) a reference (except in section  109Y) to an amount paid to a private company has effect as a reference to an amount paid to the trustee; and
 (b) a reference to a year of income of a private company has effect as a reference to the corresponding year of income of the trust estate; and
 (c) a reference to the ordinary course of a private company&#39;s business has effect as a reference to the ordinary course of the trust estate&#39;s business.
Modified operation of section 109J
 (4) Section 109J does not apply to a payment to the extent that it is a discharge of or a reduction in a present entitlement.
Modified operation of section 109R
 (6) For the purposes of applying section  109R to an actual transaction:
 (a) a reference in that section to obtaining a loan from a private company has effect as a reference to obtaining a loan from the trustee; and
 (b) a reference in that section to property transferred to a private company has effect as a reference to property transferred to the trustee; and
 (c) a reference in that section to an amount paid by a private company for a transfer of property has effect as a reference to an amount paid by the trustee for a transfer of property.
Modified operation of section 109Y
 (7) Section 109Y applies to the Division 7A amount in this way:
 (a) assume that the private company referred to in subsection  109XA(1), (2) or (3) had been taken to have paid a dividend to the shareholder or associate referred to in that subsection equal to the Division 7A amount; and
 (b) assume that the dividend was taken to have been paid at the end of the year of income of the company in which the actual transaction took place; and

Forgiveness of loan debt does not give rise to assessable income if loan gives rise to assessable income

  An amount is not included in the assessable income for a year of income of the shareholder or associate referred to in subsection  109XA(3) because of the forgiveness of an amount of a debt resulting from a loan if, because of the loan, an amount was included in the assessable income of the shareholder or associate under section  109XB (or former section 109UB) in that or an earlier year of income.

Simplified outline of this Subdivision

  The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision:
Payments and loansThis Subdivision allows an amount to be included in an entity&#39;s (the target entity&#39;s) assessable income under Subdivision EA if an entity interposed between a trustee and the target entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity under an arrangement involving the trustee.This result is achieved by treating the trustee as making a payment or loan of an amount determined by the Commissioner to the target entity.The arrangement must involve the trustee and one or more interposed entities in making payments or loans for the purpose of the target entity receiving a payment or loan from an interposed entity.If the target entity repays a fraction of the loan made by the interposed entity, the target entity is treated as repaying the same fraction of the loan taken to have been made by the trustee.Some provisions that prevent payments or loans from giving rise to assessable income do not apply to payments or loans this Subdivision  treats a trustee as making.Present entitlementsThis Subdivision similarly allows an amount to be included in an entity&#39;s assessable income under Subdivision  EA if a private company is or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of a trust estate interposed between the private company and another trust estate (the target trust) under an arrangement involving the target trust.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109XF
Payments through interposed entities

 (1) For the purposes of paragraphs 109XA(1)(a) and (1A)(a), a trustee is taken to have made a payment to a shareholder, or to an associate of a shareholder, (the target entity) of a private company if:
 (a) the trustee makes a payment or loan to another entity (the first interposed entity) that is interposed between:
 (i) the trustee; and
 (ii) the target entity; and
 (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the trustee made the payment or loan solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving a payment to the target entity; and
 (c) either:
 (i) the first interposed entity makes a payment to the target entity; or
 (ii) another entity interposed between the trustee and the target entity makes a payment to the target entity.
 (2) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:
 (a) whether the interposed entity made the payment to the target entity before, after or at the same time as the first interposed entity received the payment or loan from the trustee; or
 (b) whether or not the interposed entity paid the target entity the same amount as the trustee paid or lent the first interposed entity.
 (3) Treat the reference in paragraph  109XA(1)(b) to a payment as being a reference to the payment to the target entity mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) of this section.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109XG
Loans through interposed entities

Loans by a trustee through interposed entities
 (1) For the purposes of paragraph  109XA(2)(a), a trustee is taken to have made a loan (the notional loan) to a shareholder, or to an associate of a shareholder, (the target entity) of a private company if:
 (a) the trustee makes a payment or loan to another entity (the first interposed entity) that is interposed between:
 (i) the trustee; and
 (ii) the target entity; and
 (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the trustee made the payment or loan solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving a loan to the target entity; and
 (c) either:
 (i) the first interposed entity makes a loan to the target entity; or
 (ii) another entity interposed between the trustee and the target entity makes a loan to the target entity.
 (2) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:
 (a) whether the interposed entity made the loan to the target entity before, after or at the same time as the first interposed entity received the payment or loan from the trustee; or
 (b) whether or not the interposed entity lent the target entity the same amount as the trustee paid or lent the first interposed entity.
Notional loans
 (3) When working out whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the target entity under section  109XB as a result of the notional loan under subsection (1) of this section, and the amount included in assessable income, assume that the target entity repays an amount of the notional loan equal to the amount worked out using the formula:
  
where:
"amount actually lent to target entity" is the amount the interposed entity lent to the target entity.
"repayment made by target entity to lender" is the amount of any repayment made by the target entity of the loan the interposed entity made to the target entity.
 (4) For the purposes of section  109E (Amalgamated loan from a previous year treated as dividend if minimum repayment not made):
 (a) treat the notional loan as an amalgamated loan from the private company to the target entity; and
 (b) treat the amount of the notional loan worked out under section  109XH as the amount of the amalgamated loan; and
 (c) treat the agreement under which the actual loan was made as the agreement under which the amalgamated loan was made; and
 (d) treat repayments by the target entity of the amount of the notional loan worked out under subsection  (3) of this section as payments by the target entity to the private company in relation to the amalgamated loan.
 (5) For the purposes of section  109N (about certain loans not being treated as dividends), treat the agreement under which the actual loan was made as the agreement under which the notional loan was made.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109XH
Amount and timing of payment or loan through interposed entities

Amount of payment or loan
 (1) The amount the trustee is taken under section  109XF or 109XG to have paid or lent the target entity is the amount (if any) determined by the Commissioner.
 (2) In determining the amount of the payment or loan, the Commissioner must take account of:
 (a) the amount the interposed entity paid or lent the target entity; and
 (b) how much (if any) of that amount the Commissioner believes represented consideration payable to the target entity by:
 (i) the trustee; or
 (ii) any of the interposed entities;
  for anything (assuming that the consideration payable equals that for similar transactions at arm&#39;s length).
 (3) The total of the amounts determined under subsection  (1) for payments and loans in relation to which section 109XB applies because of the same present entitlement mentioned in paragraph 109XA(1)(c), (2)(b) or (3)(b) must not exceed the unpaid present entitlement mentioned in subsection  109XA(4).
Timing of payment or loan
 (4) The trustee is taken under section  109XF or 109XG to have made the payment or loan at the time the interposed entity made the payment or loan mentioned in paragraph 109XF(1)(c) or 109XG(1)(c) to the target entity.

Entitlements to trust income through interposed trusts

Entitlements through interposed trusts
 (1) For the purposes of paragraphs 109XA(1)(c), (2)(b) and (3)(b), a private company is taken to be or to become entitled to an amount from the net income of a trust estate (the target trust) if:
 (a) the company is or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of another trust estate (the first interposed trust) that is interposed between the target trust and the company; and
 (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the company is or becomes so entitled solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving an entitlement to an amount from the target trust; and
 (c) either:
 (i) the first interposed trust is or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the target trust; or
 (ii) another trust interposed between the target trust and the company is or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the target trust.
This section operates regardless of certain factors
 (2) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:
 (a) whether the company became or becomes entitled to the amount from the net income of the first interposed trust before, after or at the same time as the interposed trust became or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the target trust; or
 (b) whether or not the company became presently entitled to the same amount as the amount to which the interposed trust become entitled.
This section does not operate to the extent Subdivision EA would otherwise apply
 (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to the extent that an amount is included in the assessable income of a shareholder, or an associate of a shareholder, of the company under Subdivision  EA (as it applies apart from this section) as a result of the present entitlement of any interposed trust.
Amount of entitlement
 (4) The amount the private company is taken to be or to become entitled to from the net income of the target trust is the amount (if any) determined by the Commissioner.
 (5) The total amount determined under subsection  (4) for present entitlements to which that subsection applies because of the same present entitlement to an amount from the net income of the target trust mentioned in paragraph  (1)(c) must not exceed that amount.
 (6) In determining the amount of the entitlement, the Commissioner must take account of:
 (a) the amount the private company is or becomes entitled to from the net income of the first interposed trust; and
 (b) how much (if any) of that amount the Commissioner believes represented consideration payable to the private company by:
 (i) the target trust; or
 (ii) any of the interposed trusts;
  for anything (assuming that the consideration payable equals that for similar transactions at arm&#39;s length).
Timing of entitlement
 (7) The company is taken to be or to become entitled to the amount from the net income of the target trust at the time the company is or becomes entitled to the amount from the net income of the first interposed trust mentioned in paragraph  (1)(a).

Proportional reduction of dividends so they do not exceed distributable surplus

Reduction of amounts of dividends
 (1) If, apart from this section, the sum of all the dividends a private company is taken under this Division  to pay at the end of the year of income would be more than the company&#39;s distributable surplus for that year, the amount of each of those dividends is the amount worked out under subsection  (3).
Distributable surplus
 (2) A private company&#39;s distributable surplus for its year of income is the amount worked out using the formula:
  
where:
"Division 7A amounts" is the total of any amounts the company is taken under section  109C or 109F to have paid as dividends in the year of income apart from this section.
"net assets" means the amount (if any), at the end of the company&#39;s year of income, by which the company&#39;s assets (according to the company&#39;s accounting records) exceed the sum of:
 (a) the present legal obligations of the company to persons other than the company; and
 (b) the following provisions (according to the company&#39;s accounting records):
 (i) provisions for depreciation;
 (ii) provisions for annual leave and long service leave;
 (iii) provisions for amortisation of intellectual property and trade marks;
 (iv) other provisions prescribed under regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph.
If the Commissioner considers that the company&#39;s accounting records significantly undervalue or overvalue its assets or undervalue or overvalue its provisions, the Commissioner may substitute a value that the Commissioner considers is appropriate.
"non-commercial loans" means the total of:
 (a) any amounts that:
 (i) the company is taken under former section  108, or section 109D or 109E, to have paid as dividends in earlier years of income; and
 (ii) are shown as assets in the company&#39;s accounting records at the end of year of income; and
 (b) any amounts that are included in the assessable income of shareholders, or associates of shareholders, of the company under section 109XB as if the amounts were dividends paid by the company in earlier years of income.
Note: The total amount worked out under paragraph (b) might be reduced under subsection  (2A).
"paid-up share value" is the paid -up share capital of the company at the end of its year of income.
"repayments of non-commercial loans" means the total of:
 (a) any repayments to the company of loans or amounts that have been taken by former section  108, or section 109D or 109E, to be dividends; and
 (b) amounts set off against loans that have been taken by former section  108, or section 109D or 109E, to be dividends, other than such amounts that are set off as a result of:
 (i) a dividend (being a later dividend for the purposes of section  109ZC or a subsequent dividend for the purposes of former subsection 108(2)) being paid by the company to the extent of the unfranked part of the dividend; or
 (ii) a loan, or a part of a loan, being forgiven.
 (2A) Reduce the total of the amounts worked out under paragraph  (b) of the definition of non-commercial loans in subsection (2) by the total of the unfranked parts of any dividends:
 (a) that are distributed by the company; and
 (b) to which section  109ZCA applies.
 (3) The amount of a dividend that a private company is taken under this Division  to pay is worked out using the formula:
  
where:
"provisional dividend" is the amount of the dividend that the private company would be taken to pay apart from this section.
"total of provisional dividends" is the sum of all the dividends the private company is taken under this Division to pay at the end of the year of income apart from this section.
Requirement for private company to provide statement
 (4) If this section sets the amount of a dividend taken under this Division  to be paid by a private company to an entity at the end of a year of income, the private company must give the entity a written statement as soon as possible after the end of the year of income.
What the statement must contain
 (5) The statement must set out:
 (a) the private company&#39;s distributable surplus for the year of income; and
 (b) the total amount the company would be taken under this Division  to pay as dividends in the year of income apart from this section.

- SECT 109Z
Characteristics of dividends taken to be paid under this Division

  If a private company is taken under this Division  to have paid a dividend to an entity, the dividend is taken for the purposes of this Act to be paid:
 (a) to the entity as a shareholder in the private company; and
 (b) out of the private company&#39;s profits.

- SECT 109ZA
No dividend taken to be paid for withholding tax purposes

  If a private company is taken under this Division  to have paid a dividend to an entity, disregard the dividend for the purposes of:
 (a) Division 11A of Part  III (which deals with withholding tax on dividends paid to non-residents and some other people); and
 (c) Subdivision 12-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (which deals with PAYG withholding).

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109ZB
Amount treated as dividend is not a fringe benefit

 (1) This Division  applies to a loan of an amount to an entity by a private company, even if the loan is made:
 (a) to the entity in its capacity as an employee (as defined in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986) or an associate of such an employee; or
 (b) in respect of the employment of an employee (as defined in that Act).
Note: This helps ensure that a loan is not a fringe benefit for the purposes of that Act.
 (2) This Division  applies to a private company&#39;s forgiveness of a debt owed by an entity to the private company, even if:
 (a) the entity owed the debt in its capacity as an employee (as defined in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986) or an associate of such an employee; or
 (b) the forgiveness occurs in respect of the employment of an employee (as defined in that Act).
Note: This helps ensure that the forgiveness of a debt is not a fringe benefit for the purposes of that Act.
 (3) However, this Division  does not apply to a payment made to a shareholder, or an associate of a shareholder, in their capacity as an employee (as defined in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 ) or an associate of such an employee.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109ZC
Treatment of dividend that is reduced on account of an amount taken under this Division to be a dividend

 (1) This section sets out special rules for dealing with a dividend (the later dividend) distributed by a private company if some or all of the later dividend is set off against some or all of an amount taken under this Division  to be a dividend previously paid by the company.
Example: Some or all of a dividend distributed by a private company to a shareholder might be set off to reduce a loan the company had previously made to the shareholder that was treated as a dividend under Subdivision  B.
 (1A) This section also sets out special rules for dealing with a dividend (also the later dividend) distributed by a private company if:
 (a) the private company distributes the later dividend to a shareholder in the company; and
 (b) the shareholder applies the amount of the dividend to repay all or part of a loan:
 (i) that was obtained from the private company by an associate of the shareholder; and
 (ii) in relation to which a dividend was previously taken under this Division  to have been paid by the private company.
 (2) The amount of the later dividend set off or applied is taken not to be a dividend for the purposes of this Act, except Part  3-6 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (which deals with franking of distributions). However, if the amount set off or applied exceeds the amount of the later dividend that is not either the franked part of that dividend, or the part of that dividend that has been franked with an exempting credit, the excess is still a dividend.
Note: This prevents double taxation by ensuring that the entity&#39;s assessable income does not include the amount of the later dividend that is not paid to the entity (except to the extent that that amount is franked).
 (3) An amount that is taken not to be a dividend under subsection  (2) is not assessable income and is not exempt income.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 109ZCA
Treatment of dividend that is reduced on account of an amount included in assessable income under Subdivision EA

 (1) This section sets out special rules for dealing with a dividend (the later dividend) distributed by a private company if:
 (a) an amount is included in the assessable income of a shareholder, or an associate of a shareholder, of the company under section  109XB because of a loan made to the shareholder or associate by a trustee in relation to a present entitlement of the company to an amount from the net income of the trust estate; and
 (b) subsection 109XA(2) applied to the loan; and
 (c) some or all of the later dividend is applied to repay all or a part of the loan.
 (2) The amount of the later dividend applied is taken not to be a dividend for the purposes of this Act, except Part  3-6 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (which deals with franking of distributions).
 (3) However, if the amount set off or applied exceeds the amount of the later dividend that is neither:
 (a) the franked part of that dividend; nor
 (b) the part of that dividend that has been franked with an exempting credit;
the excess is still a dividend.
Note: This prevents double taxation by ensuring that the entity&#39;s assessable income does not include the amount of the later dividend that is not paid to the entity (except to the extent that that amount is franked).
 (4) An amount that is taken not to be a dividend under subsection  (2) is not assessable income and is not exempt income.

 (b) if the investment is any other kind of security--the Treasury bond rate for the applicable accounting day in respect of bonds with a 10 year term; or
 (c) in any other case--the rate mentioned in paragraph  (b), plus 3%.
Future distributable profits assumption
 (10) In working out the existing business value or the adjusted net worth, the future distributable profits are to be determined on the assumption that the company:
 (a) will not distribute its profits so as to cause its capital reserves to fall below the capital reserve adequacy level (see subsection  121AO(2)) applicable to the company; and
 (b) will distribute all of its profits except to the extent necessary for its capital reserves not to fall below the capital reserve adequacy level.

 (b) in any other case--the last day of the most recent accounting period of the company ending before the demutualisation resolution day.
Adjustment for changes after applicable accounting day
 (5) In a case covered by paragraph  (4)(b), if any significant change in the amount of the company&#39;s assets or liabilities occurs between the applicable accounting day and the demutualisation resolution day, that amount is to be adjusted to take account of the change.

 (a) is paid to a person who is a non -resident carrying on business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the person in Australia; and
 (b) is attributable to the permanent establishment; and
 (c) is not paid to the person in the person&#39;s capacity as trustee.
Note: This subsection not only ensures that this section does not apply to that income to make withholding tax payable on it, but also (as a result) ensures that none of that income is non -assessable non-exempt income under section 128D. Subsection 44(1) makes that income assessable income.
 (3F) In subsection  (3E):
"permanent establishment" of a person:
 (a) has the same meaning as in a double tax agreement (as defined in Part  X) that relates to a foreign country and affects the person; or
 (b) has the meaning given by subsection  6(1), if there is no such agreement.
 (4) A person who derives income to which this section applies that consists of a dividend is liable to pay income tax upon that income at the rate declared by the Parliament in respect of income to which this subsection applies.
 (5) A person who derives income to which this section applies that consists of interest is, subject to subsections  (6) and (7), liable to pay income tax upon that income at the rate declared by the Parliament in respect of income to which this subsection applies.
 (5A) A person who derives income to which this section applies that consists of a royalty is liable to pay income tax upon that income at the rate declared by the Parliament in respect of income to which this subsection applies.
 (6) Where:
 (a) income to which this section applies consists of interest and is paid to the person by whom it is derived by a person to whom this section applies; and
 (b) the interest is, in part only, an outgoing incurred by that person to whom this section applies in carrying on business in a country outside Australia at or through a permanent establishment of that person to whom this section applies in that country;
income tax is payable under subsection (5) upon so much only of the income as is attributable to so much of the interest as is not an outgoing so incurred.
 (7) Where:
 (a) income to which this section applies consists of interest and is paid to the person by whom it is derived by a person who, or by persons each of whom, is not a resident; and
 (b) the interest is, in part only, an outgoing incurred by the person or persons by whom it is paid in carrying on business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of that person or those persons in Australia;
income tax is payable under subsection (5) upon so much only of the income as is attributable to so much of the interest as is an outgoing so incurred.
 (8) For the purposes of subparagraphs  (2)(b)(i) and (2A)(b)(i) and paragraph (6)(b), where:
 (a) interest is paid, or has, after 2  July 1973, been paid, to a person by another person, being a person to whom this section applies, carrying on business in a country outside Australia; and
 (b) the interest or a part of the interest:
 (i) is interest incurred by the other person in gaining or producing income that is derived by the other person otherwise than in carrying on business in a country outside Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the other person in that country or is interest incurred by the other person for the purpose of gaining or producing income to be so derived; or
 (ii) is interest incurred by the other person in carrying on business for the purpose of gaining or producing income and is reasonably attributable to income that is derived, or may be derived, by the other person otherwise than in so carrying on business at or through a permanent establishment of the other person in a country outside Australia;
the interest or the part of the interest, as the case may be, is not an outgoing incurred by the other person in carrying on business in a country outside Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the other person in that country.
 (9) For the purposes of subparagraphs  (2)(b)(ii) and (2A)(b)(ii) and paragraph (7)(b), where:
 (a) interest is paid, or has, after 2  July 1973, been paid, to a person by another person or other persons (in this subsection referred to as the borrower), being:
 (i) another person who is or was carrying on business in Australia and is not or was not a resident; or
 (ii) other persons who are or were carrying on business in Australia and each of whom is not or was not a resident; and
 (b) the interest or a part of the interest:
 (i) is interest incurred by the borrower in gaining or producing income that is derived by the borrower in carrying on business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the borrower in Australia or is interest incurred by the borrower for the purpose of gaining or producing income to be so derived; or

the interest or the part of the interest, as the case may be, is an outgoing incurred by the borrower in carrying on business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the borrower in Australia.
 (9A) For the purposes of subparagraphs  (2B)(b)(i) and (2C)(b)(i), where:
 (a) a royalty is paid, to a person by another person, being a person to whom this section applies, carrying on business in a country outside Australia; and
 (b) the royalty, or a part of the royalty:
 (i) is a royalty incurred by the other person in gaining or producing income that is derived by the other person otherwise than in carrying on business in a country outside Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the other person in that country or is a royalty incurred by the other person for the purpose of gaining or producing income to be so derived; or
 (ii) is a royalty incurred by the other person in carrying on business for the purpose of gaining or producing income and is reasonably attributable to income that is derived, or may be derived, by the other person otherwise than in so carrying on business at or through a permanent establishment of the other person in a country outside Australia;

 (9B) For the purposes of subparagraphs  (2B)(b)(ii) and (2C)(b)(ii), where:
 (a) a royalty is paid to a person by another person or other persons (the licensee), being:
 (i) another person who is or was carrying on business in Australia and is not or was not a resident; or
 (ii) other persons who are or were carrying on business in Australia and each of whom is not or was not a resident; and
 (b) the royalty or a part of the royalty:
 (i) is a royalty incurred by the licensee in gaining or producing income that is derived by the licensee in carrying on business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the licensee in Australia or is a royalty incurred by the licensee for the purpose of gaining or producing income to be so derived; or

the royalty or the part of the royalty, as the case may be, is an outgoing incurred by the licensee in carrying on business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the licensee in Australia.
 (9C) If:
 (a) apart from this subsection, tax would be payable under subsection  126(1) on an amount of interest paid to a person; and
 (b) section 128F would apply to the interest, assuming that paragraph  (1)(e) of that section had not been enacted;
then:
 (c) despite anything else in this section, the interest is taken, for the purposes of this Division, to be income derived by the person and to be income to which this section applies; and
Note: As a result of this paragraph, the interest will not be subject to tax under subsection 126(1): see paragraph  126(1)(b).
 (d) in addition to the effect of any credit arising under section  18-30 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 in respect of the interest, the total tax payable by the person, other than under this section, is reduced by the amount of any tax payable under this section on the interest; and
 (e) tax paid under this section on the interest is not an allowable deduction.
 (10) Income tax payable by a person in accordance with this section is in addition to any other income tax payable by him or her upon income to which this section does not apply.
 (11) Income tax payable by a person in accordance with this section upon income to which this section applies by virtue of subsection (2A) or (2C) is in addition to, and shall not be taken into account in arriving at the amount of, any other income tax payable by him or her in respect of that income.

- SECT 128C
Payment of withholding tax

 (1) Withholding tax is due and payable by the person liable to pay the tax at the expiration of 21 days after the end of the month in which the income to which the tax relates was derived by the person.
 (3) If any of the withholding tax which a person is liable to pay remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, the person is liable to pay the general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:
 (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the withholding tax was due to be paid; and
 (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:
 (i) the withholding tax;
 (ii) general interest charge on any of the withholding tax.
Note: The general interest charge is worked out under Part IIA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953.
 (4AA) If:
 (a) a person is liable to pay the general interest charge on an amount of withholding tax which is payable on an amount that, by virtue of the application of section  128AA, is taken to consist of interest paid in relation to the transfer of a qualifying security;
 (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that:
 (i) before the security was transferred, a notice expressed to be issued under subsection  265B(4) identifying the security was given by the person, in connection with the transfer, to the transferee;
 (ii) one or more of the statements made in the notice is incorrect; and
 (iii) the person did not know of the circumstance referred to in subparagraph  (ii) at the time of transfer of the security; and
 (c) the proper amount of the withholding tax liability of the person exceeds the amount that would have been the amount of the withholding tax liability if it were determined on the basis that the statements made in the notice were correct;
the Commissioner shall remit so much of the amount of the general interest charge as bears to that amount the same proportion as the amount of the excess referred to in paragraph (c) bears to the amount of withholding tax.
 (6) The ascertainment of the amount of any withholding tax shall not be deemed to be an assessment within the meaning of any of the provisions of this Act.
 (7) The Commissioner may serve on a person, by post or otherwise, a notice in which is specified:
 (a) the amount of any withholding tax that the Commissioner has ascertained is payable by that person; and
 (b) the date on which that tax became due and payable.
 (8) The production of a notice served under subsection  (7), or of a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner purporting to be a copy of such a notice, is prima facie evidence that the amount of withholding tax specified in the notice became due and payable by the person on whom the notice was served on the date so specified.

Certain income not assessable

  Income other than income to which section  128B applies by virtue of subsection (2A), (2C) or (9C) of that section upon which withholding tax is payable, or upon which withholding tax would, but for paragraph  128B(3)(ga), (jb) or (m), section 128F, section 128FA or section 128GB, be payable, is not assessable income and is not exempt income of a person.
Note: An amount of interest paid to a person by a temporary resident is non-assessable non -exempt income: see section 768-980 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.

Tax not payable
 (2) Tax is not payable under this Division  in respect of interest to which this section applies.
Public offer test
 (3) The issue of a debenture or debt interest by a company satisfies the public offer test if the issue resulted from the debenture or debt interest being offered for issue:

Global bonds
 (4) The issue of a debenture or debt interest by a company also satisfies the public offer test if the debenture or debt interest is a global bond (see subsection (10)).
Issues and invitations that always fail the public offer test
 (5) The issue of a debenture or debt interest by a company does not satisfy the public offer test if, at the time of the issue, the company knew, or had reasonable grounds to suspect, that:
 (a) the debenture, an interest in the debenture or the debt interest was being, or would be, acquired either directly or indirectly by an associate of the company; and
 (b) either:
 (i) the associate is a non -resident and the debenture or interest, or the debt interest, was not being, or would not be, acquired by the associate in carrying on a business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the associate in Australia; or
 (ii) the associate is a resident of Australia and the debenture or interest, or the debt interest, was being, or would be, acquired by the associate in carrying on a business in a country outside Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the associate in that country; and
 (c) the debenture or interest, or the debt interest, was not being, or would not be, acquired by the associate in the capacity of:
 (i) a dealer, manager or underwriter in relation to the placement of the debenture or debt interest; or
 (ii) a clearing house, custodian, funds manager or responsible entity of a registered scheme.
 (5AA) An invitation to become a lender under a syndicated loan facility is taken never to have satisfied the public offer test if, at the time the invitation is made, the company knew, or had reasonable grounds to suspect, that:
 (a) an associate of the company is or will become a lender under the facility; and
 (b) either:
 (i) the associate is a non -resident and the associate is not or would not become a lender under the facility in carrying on a business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the associate in Australia; or

 (ii) a clearing house, custodian, funds manager or responsible entity of a registered scheme.
No exemption for interest paid to certain associates of the issuing company
 (6) This section does not apply to interest paid by the company to a person in respect of the debenture or debt interest if, at the time of the payment, the company knows, or has reasonable grounds to suspect, that:
 (a) the person is an associate of the company; and
 (b) either:
 (i) the associate is a non -resident and the payment is not received by the associate in respect of a debenture or debt interest that the associate acquired in carrying on a business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the associate in Australia; or
 (ii) the associate is a resident of Australia and the payment is received by the associate in respect of a debenture or debt interest that the associate acquired in carrying on a business in a country outside Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the associate in that country; and
 (c) the associate does not receive the payment in the capacity of a clearing house, paying agent, custodian, funds manager or responsible entity of a registered scheme.
Australian public bodies are treated as Australian resident companies
 (7) This section applies in relation to a debenture or debt interest issued by:
 (a) the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or
 (b) an authority of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory;
as if the Commonwealth, State, Territory or authority were a company and a resident of Australia.
Debentures or debt interests issued through certain non-resident subsidiaries can also get the exemption
 (8) If:
 (a) a company (the parent company) beneficially owns all of the issued equity interests in the capital of a company (the subsidiary) that is not a resident of Australia; and
 (b) the subsidiary&#39;s only business is raising finance for the purposes of the parent company; and
 (c) the subsidiary raises finance in the United States of America or in another country specified in the regulations (but not Australia) by issuing a debenture or debt interest in that country; and
 (d) when the debenture or debt interest is issued, the subsidiary is treated as a resident of that country for the purposes of the tax law (see subsection  (9)) of the country;
then this section has effect as if the parent company had raised the finance and issued the debenture or debt interest.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 128FA
Division does not apply to interest on certain publicly offered unit trust debentures or debt interests

Interest to which this section applies
 (1) This section applies to interest paid by the trustee of an eligible unit trust in respect of a debenture or debt interest issued by the trustee if:
 (a) for a debt interest other than a debenture--the debt interest:
 (i) is a syndicated loan; or
 (ii) is prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section; and
 (b) either:
 (i) the issue of the debenture or debt interest satisfies the public offer test set (see subsection  (6)); or
 (ii) for a syndicated loan--the invitation to become a lender under the relevant syndicated loan facility satisfies the public offer test (see subsection  (6A)).
 (2) If:
 (a) some or all of the transfer price (within the meaning of section  128AA) of a debenture or debt interest issued by the trustee of an eligible unit trust is taken under that section to be income that consists of interest; and
 (b) for a debt interest other than a debenture--the debt interest:
 (i) is a syndicated loan; or
 (ii) is prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section; and
 (c) either:
 (i) the issue of the debenture or debt interest satisfies the public offer test set (see subsection  (6)); or
 (ii) for a syndicated loan--the invitation to become a lender under the relevant syndicated loan facility satisfies the public offer test (see subsection  (6A));
this section applies to the interest.
Note: Subsection (4) does not apply to the interest because that subsection deals only with interest paid on a debenture or debt interest by the issuing eligible unit trust.
Tax not payable
 (3) Tax is not payable under this Division  in respect of interest to which this section applies.
No exemption for interest paid to certain associates of the issuing trustee
 (4) This section does not apply to interest paid by the trustee of an eligible unit trust to a person in respect of the debenture or debt interest if, at the time of the payment, the trustee knows, or has reasonable grounds to suspect, that:
 (a) the person is an associate of the trustee; and
 (b) either:
 (i) the associate is a non -resident and the payment is not received by the associate in respect of a debenture or debt interest that the associate acquired in carrying on a business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the associate in Australia; or
 (ii) the associate is a resident of Australia and the payment is received by the associate in respect of a debenture or debt interest that the associate acquired in carrying on a business in a country outside Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the associate in that country; and
 (c) the associate does not receive the payment in the capacity of a clearing house, paying agent, custodian, funds manager or responsible entity of a registered scheme.
Debentures or debt interests issued through certain non-resident subsidiaries can also get the exemption
 (5) If:
 (a) the trustee of an eligible unit trust holds all of the issued equity interests in the capital of a company that is not a resident of Australia; and
 (b) the company&#39;s only business is raising finance for the purposes of the eligible unit trust; and
 (c) the company raises finance in a country specified in the regulations (but not Australia) by issuing a debenture or debt interest in that country; and
 (d) when the debenture or debt interest is issued, the company is treated as a resident of that country for the purposes of the tax law (see subsection  (8)) of the country;
then this section has effect as if the trustee had raised the finance and issued the debenture or debt interest.
Public offer test
 (6) For the purposes of working out under this section whether the issue of a debenture or debt interest by the trustee of an eligible unit trust satisfies the public offer test, subsections 128F(3) to (5) apply to the trustee of the eligible unit trust in a corresponding way to the way in which those subsections apply to a company, subject to subsection  (7) of this section.
 (6A) For the purposes of working out under this section whether an invitation to become a lender under a syndicated loan facility satisfies the public offer test, subsections  128F(3A) and (5AA) apply to the trustee of the eligible unit trust in a corresponding way to the way in which those subsections apply to a company, subject to subsection  (7) of this section.
 (7) For the purposes of applying subsection  128F(3), (3A), (4), (5) or (5AA) as mentioned in subsection (6) or (6A) of this section:

 (1) The accrual amount for an accrual period is worked out using the formula:
  
Implicit interest rate
 (2) In the formula in subsection  (1), Implicit interest rate means the rate of interest worked out under section 159GQC (for a fixed return security) or 159GQD (for a variable return security), properly adjusted to take account of the case where the accrual period is less than 6 months.
Opening balance
 (3) In the formula in subsection  (1), Opening balance means the amount worked out using the formula:
Issue/transfer price + Previous accruals - Payments
where:
"Issue/transfer price" means the issue price or transfer price, as the case requires, of the security; and
"Previous accruals" means:
 (a) if paragraph (b) does not apply--the sum, whether positive or negative, of all accrual amounts for previous accrual periods in the taxpayer&#39;s maximum term; or
 (b) if the accrual period is the first in the taxpayer&#39;s maximum term--nil; and
"Payments" means all payments (other than of periodic interest) made or liable to be made under the security during all previous accrual periods in the taxpayer&#39;s maximum term.
Periodic interest etc.
 (4) In the formula in subsection  (1), Periodic interest etc. means the sum of:
 (a) all periodic interest payments made or liable to be made under the security during the accrual period, properly adjusted in the case of any payment made other than at the end of the period; and
 (b) if any payments (other than of periodic interest) made or liable to be made under the security during the accrual period are made or liable to be made other than at its end--an amount to adjust properly for the making of the payments other than at the end of the period.

Implicit interest rate for fixed return security

  For the purposes of the formula component Implicit interest rate in subsection 159GQB(1), the rate of interest for a fixed return security in relation to a taxpayer is the rate of compound interest per period of 6 months at which:
 (a) the sum of the present values of all amounts payable under the security during the taxpayer&#39;s maximum term;
equals:
 (b) the issue price or the transfer price, as the case requires, of the security.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 159GQD
Implicit interest rate for variable return security

Implicit interest rate to be recalculated each year etc.
 (1) For the purposes of the formula component Implicit interest rate in subsection 159GQB(1), the rate of interest for a variable return security must be worked out in accordance with subsection  (2) separately for each year of income during the taxpayer&#39;s maximum term. If there are 2 accrual periods of 6 months in the year of income, the rate is the same for both periods. It is possible for the rate to be negative.
Rate
 (2) The rate applicable in relation to a year of income is the rate of compound interest per period of 6 months in the calculation period (see subsection  (3)) at which:
 (a) the sum of the present values of all amounts payable under the security during the calculation period;
equals:
 (b) the opening balance, mentioned in subsection  159GQB(1), for the accrual period that begins the calculation period.
Calculation period
 (3) The calculation period means the part of the taxpayer&#39;s maximum term that occurs after the beginning of the year of income.
Where amount payable is not known
 (4) For the purposes of paragraph  (2)(a), if by the end of the year of income it is not possible to determine whether an amount will be payable, or the size of the amount that will be payable, after the end of the year of income, the determination is to be made by applying subsection  (5), (7) or (11), or a combination of those subsections.
Assumption of constant level
 (5) Subject to subsection  (7), if an amount payable is worked out to any extent by reference to the amount or level, at a particular time, of a rate, price, index or other thing, it is to be assumed that the rate, price, index or thing will be the same at all times after the end of the year of income as it was at the end of the year of income (or, if it was not available at the end of the year of income, at the time when it was last available in the year of income).
Examples
 (6) For the purposes of subsection  (5):
 (a) an example of an amount worked out wholly by reference to the amount of a rate at a particular time is an interest payment under a floating rate note. The amount payable is the product of an interest rate indicator (such as the prevailing bank bill rate) and the face or par value of the note; and
 (b) an example of an amount worked out wholly by reference to the amount of a price at a particular time is a redemption payment under a commodity linked security where the amount of the payment is the product of the prevailing price of a commodity (such as gold) and the face or par value of the security.
Assumption of continuing rate of change
 (7) If an amount payable is worked out to any extent by reference to the amount of change in an index or other thing that occurs during a period, it is to be assumed that the index or other thing will continue to change at the same rate as it did:
 (a) if the index or other thing was available at the end of the year of income--during the year of income; or
 (b) in any other case--during the period of 12 months in respect of which the index or other thing was last available in the year of income.
Example
 (8) An example for the purposes of subsection  (7) is a payment whose amount is the product of the face or par value of a security and the percentage increase in the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (the CPI) during the year ending on 30 June 1995. If the year of income for which the implicit interest rate is being worked out is the 1993-94 year of income and the CPI increases by 2% during the year ending on 31  March 1994 (the date of the last available number during the year of income), the CPI is assumed to increase by 2% during the year ending on 30  June 1995.
Disguised continuing rate of change case
 (9) For the purposes of subsection  (7), if an amount payable is worked out to any extent by reference to the quotient of:
 (a) the amount or level of an index or other thing at a particular time; and
 (b) either:
 (i) the amount or level of the index or other thing at a different time; or
 (ii) another amount that, while not expressed to be the amount or level of the index or other thing at a different time, may reasonably be regarded as representing the amount or level of the index or other thing at a different time;
the amount payable is taken to be worked out to that extent by reference to the amount of change in the index or other thing that occurs during the period between the 2 times.
Example
 (10) An example for the purposes of subsection  (9) is a payment under a security issued in December 1994 that is worked out by multiplying a number of dollars by the quotient of:
 (a) the All Groups Consumer Price Index number in respect of the quarter ending on 31  December 1997; and
 (b) the number 114.
Assume that the number in paragraph (b) is the same as the All Groups Consumer Price Index number in respect of the quarter ending on 31 December 1994. In this case, it would be reasonable to regard the number as representing the amount of the index at 31  December 1994, and therefore to apply subsection (7).
General assumption
 (11) If it is not possible to make the determination mentioned in subsection  (4) in respect of the whole or part of any amount by applying subsection (5) or (7), or both, (for example, because no information about a rate, price or index was available during the year of income), the determination in respect of that whole or part  is to be made on the basis of what is most likely in the circumstances.

Consequences of actual payments

 (1) Where a payment (not being a payment that is, or to the extent that it consists of, a periodic interest payment, a redemption payment or a partial redemption payment) is made or liable to be made in a year of income to a taxpayer under a qualifying security:
 (a) no amount shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in respect of the payment otherwise than under section  159GQ; and

Balancing adjustments on transfer of qualifying security

 (1) Where there is a profit amount in relation to the transfer of a qualifying security by a taxpayer in a year of income:
 (a) if there is a net assessable amount in relation to the transfer and:
 (i) the profit amount exceeds the net assessable amount--an amount equal to the excess shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income; or
 (ii) the net assessable amount exceeds the profit amount--an amount equal to the excess shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income; and
 (b) if there is a net deductible amount in relation to the transfer--an amount equal to the sum of that amount and the profit amount shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income.
 (2) Where there is a loss amount in relation to the transfer of a qualifying security by a taxpayer in a year of income and:
 (a) there is a net assessable amount in relation to the transfer--an amount equal to the net assessable amount shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income; or
 (b) there is a net deductible amount in relation to the transfer that exceeds the loss amount--an amount equal to the excess shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income.
 (3) For the purposes of the application of this section in relation to the transfer (in this subsection referred to as the relevant transfer) of a qualifying security by a taxpayer:
 (a) where the transfer price, as increased by the amount of any payments (other than periodic interest payments) made to the taxpayer under the security in respect of the period when the security was held by the taxpayer exceeds:
 (i) the issue price of the security; or
 (ii) where the security was acquired by the taxpayer on transfer--the transfer price in relation to that transfer;
  there shall be taken to be a profit amount in relation to the relevant transfer of an amount equal to the excess;
 (b) where the issue price of the security or, where the security was acquired by the taxpayer on transfer, the transfer price in relation to that transfer exceeds the sum of the transfer price in relation to the relevant transfer and any payments (other than periodic interest payments) made to the taxpayer under the security in respect of the period when the security was held by the taxpayer, there shall be taken to be a loss amount in relation to the relevant transfer of an amount equal to the excess;
 (c) where the sum of all amounts (if any) included under section  159GQ in the assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of the security in respect of the period when the security was held by the taxpayer exceeds the sum of all amounts (if any) allowable under those sections as deductions from the assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of the security in respect of that period, there shall be taken to be a net assessable amount in relation to the relevant transfer of an amount equal to the excess; and
 (d) where the sum of all amounts (if any) allowable under section  159GQ as deductions from the assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of the security in respect of the period when the taxpayer held the security exceeds the sum of all amounts (if any) included under those sections in the assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of the security in respect of that period, there shall be taken to be a net deductible amount in relation to the relevant transfer of an amount equal to the excess.

Tax treatment of issuer of a qualifying security

 (1) Subsections (1A) and (1B) apply if a taxpayer is an issuer of a qualifying security to which this section applies during a period (the issuer period) comprising the whole or part of a year of income.
 (1A) If, on the assumptions in subsection  (1C), an amount would be included in the taxpayer&#39;s assessable income of the year of income in respect of the issuer period, then, subject to this section, the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction in his or her assessment for the year of income equal to that amount.
 (1B) If, on the assumptions in subsection  (1C), a deduction would be allowable in the taxpayer&#39;s assessment for the year of income, then an amount equal to the deduction is included in the taxpayer&#39;s assessable income of the year of income.
 (1C) For the purposes of subsections  (1A) and (1B), the assumptions are that:
 (a) the security was issued to the taxpayer (rather than the taxpayer being the issuer of the security); and
 (b) the taxpayer held the security during the whole of the issuer period; and
 (c) the taxpayer did not transfer the security at the end of the issuer period; and
 (d) sections 159GW, 159GX and 159GY were not enacted.
 (2) A deduction is not allowable to a taxpayer under subsection  (1A) in relation to a qualifying security to which this section applies unless the taxpayer would, but for this Division, be entitled to a deduction under section  8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in respect of payments (not being redemption payments, partial redemption payments or periodic interest payments) made or liable to be made under the security in respect of the relevant period referred to in that subsection.
 (3) Where a payment (not being a payment that is, or to the extent that it consists of, a periodic interest payment, a redemption payment or a partial redemption payment) is made or liable to be made in a year of income by a taxpayer under a qualifying security to which this section applies, no amount shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in respect of the payment otherwise than under this section.
 (5) Subject to subsection  (6), this section applies to:
 (a) any qualifying security issued on or before 22  May 1986; and

Effect of Division on certain transfer profits and losses

 (1) Where, apart from this Division, a profit that is made by a resident taxpayer in relation to a transfer of a qualifying security that does not form part of the trading stock of the taxpayer would be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income, the profit shall not be so included in the assessable income of the taxpayer.
 (2) Where, apart from this Division, a loss that is incurred by a resident taxpayer in relation to a transfer of a qualifying security that does not form part of the trading stock of the taxpayer would be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income and there is a net deductible amount, within the meaning of section  159GS, in relation to the transfer, so much only of the amount of the loss as exceeds the net deductible amount shall be so allowable as a deduction.

Consequence of variation of terms of security

 (1) Where, after 22 May 1986, a material variation is made in the terms of a security, for the purposes of the application of this Division  in relation to the security in respect of the period after the variation and before any subsequent material variation:
 (a) the security shall be taken to have been issued on the terms on which it was originally issued as varied by the material variation and any prior variation;
 (b) where consideration for the variation is paid or payable by the holder of the security--the issue price of the security shall be taken to be an amount equal to the amount that was the issue price of the security immediately before this application of this subsection increased by the amount of that consideration;
 (c) where consideration for the variation is paid or payable by the issuer of the security--the issue price of the security shall be taken to be an amount equal to the amount that was the issue price of the security immediately before this application of this subsection reduced by the amount of that consideration; and
 (d) paragraph (a) of the definition of qualifying security in subsection 159GP(1) shall be disregarded.
 (2) Where:
 (a) subsection (1) applies in relation to a security held by a taxpayer in relation to a material variation in the terms of the security; and
 (b) if:
 (i) that subsection had effect not only in relation to the period after the variation but also in relation to the whole of the term of the security before the variation; and
 (ii) any previous material variations were taken into account but any subsequent material variations were disregarded;
  the sum (in this subsection referred to as the  total notional taxable income) of the taxable incomes of the taxpayer in respect of the year of income in which the variation is made and all previous years of income would have differed from the sum (in this subsection referred to as the   total actual taxable income) of the actual taxable incomes of the taxpayer of those years of income;
the following provisions have effect:
 (c) where the total notional taxable income exceeds the total actual taxable income--an amount equal to the excess shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in which the variation is made;
 (d) where the total actual taxable income exceeds the total notional taxable income--an amount equal to the excess shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in which the variation is made.
 (3) In this section, a reference to a material variation of the terms of a security is a reference to a variation of the terms of the security:
 (a) that has the effect that a security that was not a qualifying security before the variation would, if the security had been originally issued with the terms as varied and if paragraph  (a) of the definition of qualifying security in subsection 159GP(1) were disregarded, have been a qualifying security when the security was issued;
 (b) that has the effect that a security that is a qualifying security would, if originally issued with the terms as varied, not have been a qualifying security at the time of issue; or
 (c) that has the effect that the amount, or time of making, of a payment under the security, or that the holder or issuer of the security, is varied.
 (4) Where any right or option under a security to extend the term of, or otherwise vary the effect of, the security is exercised, then, for the purposes of this section, the exercise of that right or option shall be taken to be a variation of the terms of the security to provide for the extension or other effect.

for the purposes of the application of this Division (including any subsequent application of this subsection) in relation to any period after the transfer of the right or rights:
 (c) instead of the underlying security, there shall be taken to have been originally issued:
 (i) a separate security under which the payment right or payment rights transferred to the person or persons referred to in paragraph  (b) were created;
 (ii) where at the time at which that right or those rights were transferred, another payment right or other payment rights in relation to the underlying security was or were transferred to another person or to other persons jointly--a separate security under which that other right or those other rights were created; and
 (iii) where immediately after the transfer the taxpayer retains or retained any payment right or rights--a separate security under which that right or those rights were created;
 (d) where the underlying security was issued to the taxpayer--the issue price of each separate security referred to in paragraph  (c) shall be taken to be so much of the issue price of the underlying security as bears to that amount the proportion that the market value of the separate security at the time of issue of the underlying security bears to the market value of the underlying security at that time; and
 (e) where the underlying security was acquired by the taxpayer on transfer--the transfer price, in relation to that transfer, of each separate security referred to in paragraph  (c) shall be taken to be so much of the transfer price of the underlying security as bears to that amount the proportion that the market value of the separate security at the time of transfer bears to the market value of the underlying security at that time.
 (2) Where, by reason of the application of subsection  (1) in relation to the transfer after 16 December 1984 of a payment right or payment rights in relation to a security to a particular person or particular persons jointly, the payment right or rights is or are taken to comprise a separate security, then, for the purposes of the application of this Division  in relation to the separate security in relation to any period after the transfer, paragraph  (a) of the definition of qualifying security in subsection 159GP(1) shall be disregarded.
 (3) In subsections (1) and (2), payment right, in relation to a security, means a right to receive a particular payment that is liable to be made under the security.
 (4) Where:
 (a) at any time a taxpayer acquires or acquired a security (in this subsection referred to as the underlying security) on issue or transfer;

the amount of the deduction allowable shall be an amount that bears to the issue price or transfer price, as the case may be, of the underlying security the same proportion as the market value of the stripped security at the time of issue or purchase, as the case may be, bears to the market value of the underlying security at that time.

Consideration in respect of off - market purchase

 (a) in determining, for the purposes of this Act:
 (i) whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the seller under a provision of this Act other than Parts  3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about CGT); or
 (ii) whether an amount is allowable as a deduction to the seller; or

in respect of the buy-back, the seller is taken to have received or to be entitled to receive, as consideration in respect of the sale of the share, an amount equal to the purchase price in respect of the buy -back.
Deemed consideration increased to market value
 (2) If apart from this section:
 (a) the purchase price in respect of the buy -back;
is less than:
 (b) the amount that would have been the market value of the share at the time of the buy -back if the buy-back did not occur and was never proposed to occur;
then, subject to subsection (3), in making the determinations mentioned in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b), the amount of consideration that the seller is taken to have received or to be entitled to receive in respect of the sale of the share is equal to the market value mentioned in paragraph  (b) of this subsection.
Deemed consideration reduced where dividend assessable etc.
 (3) Subject to subsections  (3A) and (8), if there is a reduction amount in respect of the buy-back (see subsection (4)), then, in making the determinations mentioned in paragraphs  (1)(a) and (b), the amount of consideration that the seller is taken to have received or to be entitled to receive in respect of the sale of the share, after any application of subsection  (2), is reduced by the reduction amount.
 (3A) Subsection (3) does not apply if the buy -back is by a listed public company.
Reduction amount
 (4) The following steps are to be taken in working out whether there is a reduction amount in respect of the buy -back:
 (a) first, work out whether the whole or part of the purchase price in respect of the buy -back is taken to be a dividend by section 159GZZZP;
 (b) second, for any amount satisfying paragraph  (a), work out whether the whole or part of it is either:
 (i) included in the seller&#39;s assessable income of any year of income (disregarding section  128D of this Act and section 802-15 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997); or
 (ii) an eligible non -capital amount (see subsection (5)).
The amount worked out is the reduction amount in respect of the buy-back.
Eligible non-capital amount
 (5) An amount is an eligible non-capital amount if it is neither:
 (a) debited against a share capital account or a reserve to the extent that it consists of profits from the revaluation of assets of the company that have not been disposed of by the company; nor
 (b) attributable, either directly or indirectly, to amounts that were transferred from such an account or reserve of the company.
Debit for deemed dividend
 (7) For the purposes of subsection  (5), an amount of the purchase price that is taken to be a dividend by section 159GZZZP is taken to have been debited against the account or reserves against which the purchase price was debited, and to the same extent.
Offsetable amount excluded from reduction where loss
 (8) If:
 (aa) the seller is a corporate tax entity; and
 (a) the amount of consideration that the seller is taken by subsection  (1) or (2) to have received or to be entitled to receive in respect of the sale of the share is, apart from this subsection, reduced by a reduction amount under subsection (3); and
 (b) the dividend mentioned in paragraph  (4)(a), so far as it does not exceed the reduction amount, consists to any extent of an offsetable amount (see subsection (9)); and
 (c) disregarding this subsection, as a result of the operation of this section:
 (i) for the purposes of Parts  3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about CGT), the seller incurs a capital loss or an increased capital loss (which loss or increase is the loss amount) in respect of the buy-back; or
 (ii) a loss, or an increased loss, (which loss or increase is also the loss amount) in respect of the buy-back is allowable as a deduction to the seller under a provision of a Part  of this Act other than Part 3-1 or 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; or
 (iii) the amount of a deduction allowable from the seller&#39;s assessable income of any year of income in respect of the issue or acquisition of the share exceeds, or exceeds by a greater amount, (the excess or increased excess is also the loss amount ) the amount included in the seller&#39;s assessable income of any year of income in respect of the buy-back of the share;
then the reduction in the amount of the consideration under subsection (3) is instead a reduction equal to:
 (d) the reduction amount;
less:
 (e) so much of the offsetable amount as does not exceed the loss amount.
Meaning of offsetable amount
 (9) For the purposes of subsection  (8), if the seller is entitled to a tax offset under Division 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in the seller&#39;s assessment for a year of income in respect of the dividend, the dividend consists of an offsetable amount worked out using the formula:

Protection for anticipation of certain discontinued announcements

Limit on amending assessments
 (1) The Commissioner cannot amend an assessment of a taxpayer about a particular in a way that would produce a less favourable result for the taxpayer if:
 (a) the taxpayer has anticipated amendments (see subsection (3)); and
 (b) in making the assessment, the particular was ascertained on the basis of the taxpayer&#39;s anticipated amendments having been made; and
 (c) that way of amending the assessment would instead ascertain the particular on the basis of the anticipated amendments not having been made.
Anticipation not to give rise to administrative overpayment
 (2) If ascertaining that particular on the basis of the taxpayer&#39;s anticipated amendments not having been made:
 (a) would not result in an amendment of the assessment; but
 (b) would, apart from this subsection, result in an amount the Commissioner paid to the taxpayer on the basis of the assessment being an administrative overpayment (within the meaning of section  8AAZN of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 );
the amount of the administrative overpayment is taken, for the purposes of the taxation law, to be an amount to which the taxpayer is entitled.
Meaning of anticipated amendments
 (3) One or more hypothetical amendments of the taxation law, taken together, are anticipated amendments a taxpayer has if:
 (a) the amendments, if made, would reasonably reflect an announcement mentioned in the table in subsection  (8); and
 (b) a statement made by or on behalf of the taxpayer:
 (i) is consistent with the amendments having been made; and
 (ii) is made in good faith; and
 (iii) meets the timing requirement in column 2 of an applicable item of the following table.
 
Timing requirements for statementsItemColumn 1In this case:Column 2The timing requirement is:1The statement is made in a return lodged on or before 14 December 2013The return:(a) is lodged in the period that the announcement is on foot (see subsection (8)); and(b) was not required to be lodged before the start of that period.2The statement is made otherwise than in a returnThe statement is made in the period that the announcement is on foot.3All of the following apply:(a) the statement is made in a return of the taxpayer lodged after 14 December 2013;(b) the return was not required to be lodged on or before that date;(c) just before the statement is made, no return has been given, and no assessment has been made, in relation to the taxpayer in respect of the year of income to which the statement relatesThe statement relates to the application of the taxation law (as hypothetically amended by the amendments) to events or circumstances:(a) that happened or existed on or before 14 December 2013; or(b) to the happening or existence of which the taxpayer had definitively committed on or before 14 December 2013.
 (4) In determining, for the purpose of paragraph  (3)(a), whether amendments would reasonably reflect an announcement, have regard to the following:
 (a) the terms of the announcement;
 (b) any related document published after the announcement on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, the Department of the Treasury or the Commissioner;
 (c) if the announcement proposes to apply to a particular kind of scheme or practice--that kind of scheme or practice;
 (d) existing provisions of the taxation law, if:
 (i) the announcement proposes to effect a particular result in relation to the operation of the taxation law; and
 (ii) those existing provisions effect that result, or a substantially similar result, in relation to another matter;
 (e) any other relevant matter.
Operation of section
 (5) Subsections (1) and (2) apply despite any other provision of the taxation law, apart from subsections  (6) and (7), (which are about exceptions).
Exceptions
 (6) Subsection (1) does not prevent an amendment if:
 (a) the taxpayer applies for the amendment; or
 (b) the Commissioner may make the amendment in accordance with item  6 (objection, review or appeal) of the table in subsection 170(1).
 (7) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply in relation to a particular ascertained on the basis of a taxpayer&#39;s anticipated amendments, in any year of income, if:
 (a) the taxpayer makes a statement (in a return of income or otherwise) for a later year of income that is not consistent with the taxpayer&#39;s anticipated amendments; and
 (b) if the assessment for the later year of income was to be made on the basis of the taxpayer&#39;s anticipated amendments, instead of on the basis of the statement, the result would be less favourable to the taxpayer in that year of income.
Note: An amendment of an assessment can be made at any time to give effect to this subsection (see item  27A of the table in subsection 170(10)).
Table of discontinued announcements
 (8) The following table lists the announcements to which this section applies. An announcement is on foot during the period:

 (2A) A reference in this Part  to the obtaining by a taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme is to be read as not including a reference to:
 (a) the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income not including an amount that would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out where:
 (i) the non-inclusion of the amount in the assessable income of the taxpayer is attributable to the making of a choice under Subdivision  126-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 or an agreement under Subdivision 170-B of that Act; and
 (ii) the scheme consisted solely of the making of the agreement or election; or
 (b) a capital loss being incurred by the taxpayer during a year of income the whole or part of which would not have been, or might reasonably be expected not to have been, incurred by the taxpayer during the year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out where:
 (i) the incurring of the capital loss by the taxpayer is attributable to the making of a choice under Subdivision  126-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 or an agreement under Subdivision  170-B of that Act; and
 (ii) the scheme consisted solely of the making of the agreement or election; or
 (c) an exploration credit being issued to the taxpayer the whole or a part of which would not have been, or might reasonably be expected not to have been, issued to the taxpayer if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out, where:
 (i) the issuing of the exploration credit to the taxpayer is attributable to the making of a choice under Division  418 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; and

 (3) For the purposes of subparagraph  (2)(a)(i), (b)(i), (c)(i), (ca)(i), (d)(i), (e)(i), (f)(i) or (g)(i) or (2A)(a)(i), (b)(i) or (c)(i):

 (b) the allowance of a deduction to a taxpayer; or
 (c) the incurring of a capital loss by a taxpayer; or
 (ca) the allowance of a foreign income tax offset to a taxpayer; or
 (caa) the allowance of an innovation tax offset to a taxpayer; or

 (cc) the allowance of a refundable R&D tax offset, or a non -refundable R&D tax offset, to a taxpayer; or
 (cd) the allowance of a CMPTI tax offset to a taxpayer;
is taken to be attributable to the making of a declaration, election, agreement or selection, the giving of a notice or the exercise of an option where, if the declaration, election, agreement, selection, notice or option had not been made, given or exercised, as the case may be:
 (d) the amount would have been included in that assessable income; or
 (e) the deduction would not have been allowable; or
 (f) the capital loss would not have been incurred; or

 (a) an amount of income is not included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income; and
 (b) an amount would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, in the assessable income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out; and
 (c) instead, the taxpayer or any other taxpayer makes a discount capital gain (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) for that or any other year of income.

 (b) the whole or a part of a deduction not being allowable to the taxpayer;

 (i) the substance of the scheme; and
 (ii) any result or consequence for the taxpayer that is or would be achieved by the scheme (other than a result in relation to the operation of this Act); but
 (b) disregard any result in relation to the operation of this Act that would be achieved by the postulate for any person (whether or not a party to the scheme).
 (5) Subsection (4) applies in relation to the scheme as if references in that subsection to the operation of this Act included references to the operation of any foreign law relating to taxation:
 (a) if this Part applies to the scheme because of section  177DA or 177J; or

Bare acquisition of membership interests or interest in membership interests
 (4) It is not to be concluded for the purposes of paragraph  (3)(e) that a person entered into or carried out a scheme for a purpose mentioned in that paragraph merely because the person acquired membership interests, or an interest in membership interests, in the entity.

 (b) whether the relevant taxpayer would, in the year of income in which the distribution is made, or if the distribution flows indirectly to the relevant taxpayer, in the year in which the distribution flows indirectly to the relevant taxpayer, derive a greater benefit from franking credits than other entities who hold membership interests, or have interests in membership interests, in the corporate tax entity;

 (g) whether a deduction is allowable or a capital loss is incurred in connection with a distribution that is made or that flows indirectly under the scheme;
 (ga) whether a distribution that is made or that flows indirectly under the scheme to the relevant taxpayer is sourced, directly or indirectly, from unrealised or untaxed profits;
 (h) whether a distribution that is made or that flows indirectly under the scheme to the relevant taxpayer is equivalent to the receipt by the relevant taxpayer of interest or of an amount in the nature of, or similar to, interest;
 (i) the period for which the relevant taxpayer held membership interests, or had an interest in membership interests, in the corporate tax entity;
 (j) any of the matters referred to in subsection  177D(2).
Meaning of greater benefit from franking credits
 (18) The following subsection lists some of the cases in which a taxpayer to whom a distribution flows indirectly receives a greater benefit from franking credits than an entity referred to in paragraph  (17)(b). It is not an exhaustive list.
 (19) A taxpayer to whom a distribution flows indirectly receives a greater benefit from franking credits than an entity referred to in paragraph (17)(b) if any of the following circumstances exist in relation to that entity in the year of income in which the distribution giving rise to the benefit is made, and not in relation to the taxpayer if:
 (a) the entity is not an Australian resident; or
 (b) the entity would not be entitled to any tax offset under Division  207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 because of the distribution; or
 (c) the amount of income tax that would be payable by the entity because of the distribution is less than the tax offset to which the entity would be entitled; or
 (d) the entity is a corporate tax entity at the time the distribution is made, but no franking credit arises for the entity as a result of the distribution; or
 (e) the entity is a corporate tax entity at the time the distribution is made, but cannot use franking credits received on the distribution to frank distributions to its own members because:
 (i) it is not a franking entity; or
 (ii) it is unable to make frankable distributions.
Note: Where the distribution is made directly to the taxpayer, see subsections  204-30(7), (8), (9) and (10) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 for a list of circumstances in which the taxpayer will be treated as deriving a greater benefit from franking credits than another entity.

 (c) a credit arises in the franking account of the head company of the group because of the joining entity becoming a subsidiary member of the group; and

Bare acquisition of membership interests

Relevant circumstances
 (10) The relevant circumstances of a scheme include the following:

 (b) whether the head company, or a person holding membership interests in the head company, would, in the year of income in which the joining entity became a subsidiary member of the group or any later year of income, derive a greater benefit from franking credits than other persons who held membership interests in the joining entity immediately before it became a subsidiary member of the group;
 (c) the extent (if any) to which the joining entity was able to pay a franked dividend or distribution immediately before it became a subsidiary member of the group;
 (d) whether any consideration paid or given by or on behalf of, or received by or on behalf of, the head company in connection with the scheme (for example, the amount of any interest on a loan) was calculated by reference to the franking credit benefits to be received by the head company;
 (e) the period for which the head company held membership interests in the joining entity;
 (f) any of the matters referred to in subsection  177D(2).
Section to apply to exempting credits

Diverted profits tax--objects

 (1) The primary objects of the DPT provisions are:
 (a) to ensure that the Australian tax payable by significant global entities properly reflects the economic substance of the activities that those entities carry on in Australia; and
 (b) to prevent those entities from reducing the amount of Australian tax they pay by diverting profits offshore through contrived arrangements between related parties.
 (2) In addition, the DPT provisions (in combination with Division  145 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953) have the object of encouraging significant global entities to provide sufficient information to the Commissioner to allow for the timely resolution of disputes about Australian tax.

Diverted profits tax--application

Scheme for a purpose including obtaining a tax benefit etc.
 (1) This Part also applies to a scheme, in relation to a tax benefit (the DPT tax benefit) if:
 (a) a taxpayer (a relevant taxpayer) has obtained, or would but for section 177F obtain, the DPT tax benefit in connection with the scheme, in a year of income; and
 (b) it would be concluded (having regard to the matters in subsection  (2)) that the person, or one of the persons, who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme did so for a principal purpose of, or for more than one principal purpose that includes a purpose of:
 (i) enabling the relevant taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit, or both to obtain a tax benefit and to reduce one or more of the relevant taxpayer&#39;s liabilities to tax under a foreign law, in connection with the scheme; or
 (ii) enabling the relevant taxpayer and another taxpayer (or other taxpayers) each to obtain a tax benefit, or both to obtain a tax benefit and to reduce one or more of their liabilities to tax under a foreign law, in connection with the scheme;
  whether or not that person who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme is the relevant taxpayer or is the other taxpayer or one of the other taxpayers; and
 (c) the relevant taxpayer is a significant global entity for the year of income mentioned in paragraph  (a); and
 (d) a foreign entity is an associate (within the meaning of section  318) of the relevant taxpayer at any time in the year of income mentioned in paragraph (a); and
 (e) that foreign entity:
 (i) is the person, or one of the persons, who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme; or
 (ii) is otherwise connected with the scheme or any part of the scheme; and
 (f) the relevant taxpayer is not any of the following:
 (i) a managed investment trust (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997);
 (ii) an entity covered by paragraph  275-20(4)(f) of that Act (foreign collective investment vehicle with a wide membership);

 (iv) a complying superannuation entity (within the meaning of that Act);
 (v) a foreign pension fund (within the meaning of that Act); and

 (i) section 177K ($25 million income test);
 (ii) section 177L (sufficient foreign tax test);
 (iii) section 177M (sufficient economic substance test).

 (d) the amount of the tax benefit mentioned in paragraph  (1)(b).
Deferral of foreign tax liabilities
 (3) For the purposes of paragraph  (1)(b), a deferral of a taxpayer&#39;s liabilities to tax under a foreign law is taken to be a reduction of those liabilities, unless there are reasonable commercial grounds for the deferral.
Modification where thin capitalisation provisions apply
 (4) Subsection (5) applies if:
 (a) Division 820 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about thin capitalisation) applies to the relevant taxpayer for the year of income mentioned in paragraph (1)(a); and
 (b) the DPT tax benefit includes all or part of a debt deduction (within the meaning of that Act); and
 (c) the calculation of the amount of the DPT tax benefit involves applying a rate to a debt interest (within the meaning of that Act).

Modification where foreign entity is CFC
 (6) Subsection (6A) applies if:
 (a) the foreign entity mentioned in paragraph  (1)(d) is a CFC (within the meaning of Part X); and
 (b) an amount of attributable income (within the meaning of that Part) of the foreign entity has been included as a result of the operation of that Part  in the assessable income of:

 (b) is directly referable to the DPT tax benefit.
Schemes outside Australia
 (7) This section applies whether or not the scheme has been or is entered into or carried out in Australia or outside Australia or partly in Australia and partly outside Australia.

the Commissioner may reduce the attribution percentage referred to in paragraph (a) by such amount as the Commissioner considers reasonable in the circumstances.
 (4) If:
 (a) in calculating the percentage that would be the attribution percentage of an attributable taxpayer (apart from this subsection and subsection  (5)) in relation to a CFT (in this subsection called the attributing CFT ) at a particular time (in this subsection called the test time) regard was had to:
 (i) a direct attribution interest of the attributable taxpayer in relation to the attributing CFT, being direct attribution interest determined under subsection  356(2); or
 (ii) an attribution tracing interest of an eligible transferor in relation to another CFT (in this subsection called the interposed CFT); and
 (b) the attribution percentage referred to in paragraph  (a) is greater than it would have been apart from subsection 356(2) or 360(1), as the case may be; and
 (c) at the test time, there are other eligible transferors in relation to the attributing CFT or the interposed CFT, as the case may be; and
 (d) the attributable taxpayer gives to the Commissioner such information, and produces to the Commissioner such documents, as the Commissioner requires in connection with the operation of this subsection;
the Commissioner may reduce the attribution percentage referred to in paragraph (a) by such amount as the Commissioner considers reasonable in the circumstances.
 (5) If, apart from this subsection, the aggregate of the attribution percentages of all the attributable taxpayers in relation to a CFC or CFT at a particular time would exceed 100%, the attribution percentage of each of those attributable taxpayers is the percentage calculated using the formula:
  
where:
"Individual percentage"  means the percentage that would, apart from this subsection, be the attribution percentage of the attributable taxpayer concerned.
"Total percentage"  means the aggregate of the percentages that would, apart from this subsection, be the attribution percentages of all the attributable taxpayers.

 (a) by multiplying the direct attribution account interest that the bottom entity holds in the first interposed entity by the direct attribution account interest that the first interposed entity holds in the second interposed entity; and
 (b) by multiplying the result of the calculation in paragraph  (a) by the direct attribution account interest that the second interposed entity holds in the top entity.
 (5) If there are 3 or more entities interposed between the bottom entity and the top entity, the indirect attribution account interest is calculated:
 (a) by multiplying the direct attribution account interest that the bottom entity holds in the first interposed entity by the direct attribution account interest that the first interposed entity holds in the second interposed entity; and
 (b) by multiplying the result of the multiplication referred to in paragraph  (a) by the direct attribution account interest that the second interposed entity holds in the third interposed entity;

 (a) the attribution credit does not arise for the partnership or trust; and
 (b) an attribution credit arises in relation to the attribution account entity for:

 (iii) any taxpayer in the capacity of trustee of a trust, where, as a result of the amount being so included, a tax detriment would arise for the taxpayer in respect of an amount assessable to the taxpayer under section  99 or 99A, in circumstances referred to in paragraph  460(4)(a); and
 (c) the amount of the attribution credit referred to in paragraph  (b) equals the amount of the tax detriment, as reduced by any application of section 460; and
 (d) the attribution credit referred to in paragraph  (b) arises at the time when the attribution credit referred to in paragraph (a) would, but for this subsection, have arisen.
 (7) Subsection (6) does not apply to an Australian trust that is, in relation to the year of income referred to in that subsection:
 (b) a public trading trust within the meaning of Division  6C of that Part; or

 (b) an amount (in this subsection called the section 457 amount) is included in a taxpayer&#39;s assessable income under section  457 as a result of the change of residence; and
 (c) a particular part (in this subsection called the eligible part) of the section 457 amount is attributable to a hypothetical disposal of a particular asset of the company at the residence change time; and
 (d) it might reasonably be expected that, if and when the company actually disposes of the asset, so much of the gain derived by the company on the actual disposal of the asset that accrued before the residence change time will be subject to tax in the listed country;
the taxpayer may elect to defer the timing of so much of the paragraph (1)(b) attribution credit as is attributable to the eligible part from the time of the change of residence referred to in that paragraph until immediately before the payment by the company of a dividend out of the gain derived by the company on the actual disposal of the asset.
 (9) An election for the purposes of subsection  (8):
 (b) is irrevocable; and
 (c) has no effect unless it is made:
 (i) within 6 months after the end of the later of the following years of income:

 (i) if the attribution account payment is made to the taxpayer--the attribution account payment;
 (ii) in any other case--the taxpayer&#39;s attribution account percentage (for the attribution account entity to which the payment is made) of the attribution account payment.
 (4) Where:
 (a) the attribution account payment is made to an attribution account entity that is a trust; and
 (b) the attribution surplus, for the eligible entity, is in relation to the taxpayer in the capacity of trustee of the trust (because it is a surplus that resulted from an attribution credit or credits that arose under subparagraph  371(6)(b)(iii));
then the amount of the attribution debit is the lesser of:
 (c) the attribution surplus; and
 (d) any amount assessable to the taxpayer under section  99 or 99A in relation to the net income of the trust of the year of income in which the attribution account payment is made.

 (b) section 63D of this Act is to be disregarded; and
 (c) subsection (2) of this section has effect.
 (2) Where:
 (a) apart from this subsection, an amount would be a notional allowable deduction to the eligible CFC under section  8-1 or 25-35 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in respect of the writing off of a debt as bad; and
 (b) the debt was created or acquired in the ordinary course of a money -lending business of the eligible CFC that carries on that business; and
 (c) assuming that income:
 (i) that has been derived by the eligible CFC in respect of the debt; or
 (ii) that would have been reasonably likely to have been derived by the eligible CFC in respect of the debt if it had not become bad;
  were instead derived by the eligible CFC during periods to which it may reasonably be attributed, there would be a part or parts (which part or the total of which parts is in this subsection called the notional exempt income period) of the period (in this subsection called the eligible debt holding period) beginning when the debt was so created or acquired, and ending when it was written off, in respect of which some or all of that income would not be included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for any statutory accounting period;
then only a proportion of the amount referred to in paragraph (a) is a notional allowable deduction, being the proportion calculated using the following formula:

where:
"Eligible debt holding period" means the number of days in the eligible debt holding period.
"Notional exempt income period" means the number of days in the notional exempt income period.
"Eligible debt term" means:
 (d) where the debt was acquired from a person other than an associate--the number of days in the eligible debt holding period; or
 (e) in any other case--the number of days in the period beginning on the day on which the debt was created (whether by the eligible CFC or another person) and ending at the end of the day on which it was written off.
 (3) For the purposes of subsection  (2):
 (a) where a debt that is written off was acquired from another person, the creation and any previous acquisition of the debt is to be disregarded, other than for the purposes of paragraph  (2)(e); and
 (b) if, on the assumption in paragraph  (2)(c), income would be derived by the eligible CFC during a period before the first statutory accounting period of the eligible CFC beginning on or after 1 July 1990, then, in spite of anything in that paragraph, that income is taken not to be included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for any statutory accounting period; and
 (c) it is to be assumed that, for any statutory accounting period for which there is no requirement to calculate the attributable income of the eligible CFC in relation to the eligible taxpayer, there is such a requirement.
 (4) Where a part of a debt is written off as bad, the preceding provisions of this section apply as if the part were an entire debt that is written off as bad.
 (5) This section has the same effect in relation to an allowable deduction under section  63E in respect of the whole or part of a debt that is extinguished as it has in relation to an allowable deduction under section 8-1 or 25 -35  of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in respect of the whole or part of a debt that is written off as bad.

Reduction of disposal consideration or capital proceeds if attributed income not distributed

 (1) If:
 (a) it is necessary, for the purposes of applying a provision of this Act in calculating the attributable income of the eligible CFC in relation to the eligible taxpayer, to take into account:
 (i) the amount of consideration received, entitled to be received or taken to have been received, by the eligible CFC in respect of the disposal of an asset; or
 (ii) the capital proceeds from a CGT event happening in relation to a CGT asset;
  being an asset that is an interest in an attribution account entity (the disposal entity); and
 (b) immediately before the disposal or CGT event takes place, either or both of the following conditions are satisfied:
 (i) there is an attribution surplus for the disposal entity in relation to the eligible taxpayer;
 (ii) there is an attribution surplus for one or more other attribution account entities in relation to the eligible taxpayer, where each such entity is one in which the eligible taxpayer has an indirect attribution account interest held through the disposal entity;
then:
 (c) for the purpose of calculating the attributable income, the consideration or capital proceeds that, apart from this section, would be taken into account under the provision referred to in paragraph  (a) in respect of the disposal or CGT event is, subject to subsection  (3), taken to be reduced by the grossed-up amount of the attribution surplus, or the sum of the grossed-up amounts of the attribution surpluses, as the case requires; and
 (d) for the purposes of this Act, attribution debits and credits arise in accordance with subsection  (5).
 (3) For the purposes of paragraph  (1)(c):
 (a) a reference to the grossed -up amount of an attribution surplus is a reference to the amount of the surplus divided by the eligible taxpayer&#39;s attribution account percentage for the eligible CFC; and
 (b) where the disposal of the asset, or the CGT event, causes the eligible taxpayer&#39;s attribution account percentage for an attribution account entity in relation to which there is an attribution surplus to be reduced by a proportion, then only that proportion of the attribution surplus is, subject to this subsection, to be taken into account under that paragraph; and
 (c) where there is only one attribution surplus referred to in that paragraph and (after any application of paragraph  (b) of this subsection) its grossed-up amount exceeds the consideration in respect of the disposal or the capital proceeds from the CGT event, then the surplus is only to be taken into account to the extent that its grossed -up amount equals the consideration or those capital proceeds; and
 (d) where there are 2 or more attribution surpluses referred to in paragraph  (1)(c) and (after any application of paragraph (b) of this subsection) the sum of their grossed-up amounts exceeds the consideration in respect of the disposal or the capital proceeds from the CGT event, then:
 (i) if the taxpayer makes an election that for the purposes of this paragraph, a part of each surplus (after any application of paragraph  (b)) such that the sum of the grossed-up amounts of the parts to which the election relates equals the consideration or those capital proceeds--only the part to which the election relates of each surplus is to be taken into account under paragraph  (1)(c); or
 (ii) if subparagraph  (i) does not apply--only a proportion of each surplus (after any application of paragraph (b)) is to be taken into account under paragraph (1)(c), being the proportion calculated using the formula:
  
  where:
  consideration means the amount of the consideration or the capital proceeds.
  total grossed -up surplus means the sum of the grossed-up amounts of the attribution surpluses (after any application of paragraph  (b)).
 (4) An election for the purposes of paragraph  (3)(d) must be made on or before the date of lodgment of the eligible taxpayer&#39;s return of income for the year of income in which the eligible period ends or within such further period after the lodgment of the return as the Commissioner allows.
 (5) For the purposes of this Act:
 (a) an attribution debit is taken to arise at the time of the disposal under section  372, in relation to the eligible taxpayer, for each attribution account entity (in this section called a surplus entity) in relation to which there is an attribution surplus to which paragraph  (1)(c) applies; and
 (b) the amount of the attribution debit is equal to so much of the surplus as is taken into account under paragraph  (1)(c); and
 (c) there is no grossed-up amount in relation to the attribution debit under section  373; and
 (d) an attribution credit equal to the debit is taken to arise, at the time of the disposal or of the CGT event, under section  371 for the eligible CFC in relation to the eligible taxpayer.
 (6A) In determining, for the purposes of this section, whether there was an attribution surplus immediately before a CGT event, and the amount of such a surplus, also take into account any attribution credit that later arises because the CGT event caused section  104-175 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (as it notionally applies to the CGT event entity under this Division) to operate.
 (7) In this section:
"interest", in relation to an attribution account entity, means:
 (a) if the entity is a company--an interest in shares in the company, or an entitlement to acquire such an interest; or
 (b) if the entity is a partnership--an interest of a partner in the profits or property of the partnership, or an entitlement of a partner to acquire such an interest; or
 (c) if the entity is a trust--an entitlement of a beneficiary to a share of the income or corpus of the trust, or an entitlement of a beneficiary to acquire such an entitlement.

 (c) on the making of the attribution account payment, an attribution debit arises for the attribution account entity in relation to the eligible taxpayer;
then so much (if any) of the whole or the part of the attribution account payment as does not exceed the grossed-up amount of the attribution debit is notional exempt income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period.
 (4) If:
 (a) a FIF attribution account entity (within the meaning of former Part  XI) makes a FIF attribution account payment (within the meaning of former Part XI) to the eligible CFC in the eligible period; and

 (b) subsection 457(3) does not apply to the change of residence; and
 (c) because of the change in its residency status, an amount is included in the eligible taxpayer&#39;s assessable income under section  457 (including because of paragraph 58(1)(d) of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Act 1990 ); and
 (d) a CGT event happens during the eligible period in relation to a CGT asset (the CFC asset) that the eligible CFC owned since the residency change time.
 (3) If the conditions in subsection  (4) are satisfied, the capital proceeds from the CGT event are reduced by the amount worked out under subsection (5). If the conditions in subsection  (6) are satisfied, those capital proceeds are increased by the amount worked out under subsection (7).
Reduction of capital proceeds
 (4) If all the eligible CFC&#39;s assets were disposed of at the residency change time for their market values in the circumstances mentioned in subparagraph  457(2)(a)(ii):
 (a) distributable profits of the eligible CFC of a particular amount (the distributable profit amount) would be created, or its distributable profits would be increased by an amount (also the distributable profit amount); and
 (b) the eligible CFC would have made a profit (the CFC asset profit) on the disposal of the CFC asset.
 (5) The capital proceeds are reduced by:

 (i) because of Division  17 of former Part IIIA of this Act, that Part did not apply to the disposal of the asset to the eligible CFC by another CFC during the eligible period or an earlier statutory accounting period; or
 (ii) there was a roll-over under Division  122, 124 or 126 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (except under Subdivision 124-J, 124 -K or 124-L of that Act) for a CGT event (the earlier CGT event) that happened during that period in relation to the asset and involving the eligible CFC and another CFC; and

 (i) apart from Division  17 of former Part IIIA of this Act, would have accrued to the other CFC in respect of the disposal if the consideration in respect of the disposal had been the market value of the asset at the time of the disposal; or
 (ii) the other CFC would have made from the earlier CGT event apart from the roll-over if the capital proceeds from that event had been the market value of the asset at the time of that event.

Sometimes - exempt income etc.

 (1) Where an amount is not included in the eligible CFC&#39;s notional assessable income for a statutory accounting period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible taxpayer because:
 (a) the eligible CFC passes the active income test for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer; or
 (b) subsection 385 (4) applies;
then the amount is sometimes-exempt income of the eligible CFC for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.
 (2) Where an amount would, disregarding section  431, only be a notional allowable deduction of the eligible CFC for a statutory accounting period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible taxpayer if the eligible CFC&#39;s sometimes -exempt income for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer were instead notional assessable income, then the amount is a sometimes-exempt deduction of the eligible CFC for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.
 (3) Where the eligible CFC&#39;s sometimes -exempt deductions for a statutory accounting period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible taxpayer exceed its sometimes-exempt income for the period in relation to the taxpayer, the excess is a (sometimes -exempt income) loss of the eligible CFC for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.
 (4) Where an eligible CFC&#39;s sometimes -exempt income for a statutory accounting period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible taxpayer exceeds its sometimes-exempt deductions for the period in relation to the taxpayer, the excess is a (sometimes -exempt income) gain of the eligible CFC for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.

Deduction etc. for previous period loss

 (1) Where there are one or more losses of the eligible CFC of any statutory accounting period before the eligible period, the losses, to the extent they have not been previously taken into account under this section in respect of any such period, are to be taken into account in accordance with this section.
 (2) The losses are to be taken into account as follows:
 (a) they are to be applied first against any (sometimes -exempt income) gain for the eligible period, to the extent that the gain has not already been applied under section 426 in determining whether there is a loss for the eligible period;
 (b) any excess is then a notional allowable deduction for the eligible period, but only to the extent that the deduction does not exceed the amount of the notional assessable income for the period as reduced by notional allowable deductions other than under this section;
 (c) where there are 2 or more losses, they are to be taken into account in the order in which they arose.
 (3) A loss for a statutory accounting period is only to be taken into account under subsection  (2) if the eligible CFC was a CFC at the end of that statutory accounting period and each following statutory accounting period before the eligible period.
 (4) A loss for a statutory accounting period is to be taken into account under subsection  (2) only if:
 (a) where the eligible CFC is a resident of a listed country at the end of the eligible period:
 (i) the eligible CFC is a resident of a listed country at the end of that statutory accounting period; and
 (ii) if there are any statutory accounting periods (the intervening periods) occurring between that statutory accounting period and the eligible period--the eligible CFC was a resident of a listed country at the end of each of the intervening periods; or
 (b) where the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the end of the eligible period:
 (i) the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the end of that statutory accounting period; and
 (ii) if there are any statutory accounting periods (also the intervening periods) occurring between that statutory accounting period and the eligible period--the eligible CFC was a resident of an unlisted country at the end of each of the intervening periods.
 (4A) If:
 (a) at the end of both the eligible period and of a prior statutory accounting period, the eligible CFC was a resident of the same country; and

 (i) a listed country at the end of the eligible period and an unlisted country at the end of that statutory accounting period; or
 (ii) an unlisted country at the end of the eligible period and a listed country at the end of that statutory accounting period;
subsection (4) does not prevent a loss for that statutory accounting period, or an earlier statutory accounting period, from being taken into account under subsection  (2).
 (4B) If:
 (a) the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the end of the eligible period; and
 (b) that country emerged from the dissolution of another country; and
 (c) the other country was in existence at the end of a prior statutory accounting period; and
 (d) at the end of that statutory accounting period, the CFC was a resident of the other country; and
 (e) the other country was a listed country at the end of that statutory accounting period;
subsection (4) does not prevent a loss for that statutory accounting period, or an earlier statutory accounting period, from being taken into account under subsection  (2).
 (4D) If:
 (a) as a result of the operation of subsection  (4), a loss of a CFC for a statutory accounting period was not taken into account under subsection (2) in calculating the attributable income of the CFC for a later statutory accounting period (the second statutory accounting period); and
 (b) the eligible period is later than the second statutory accounting period;
then, despite anything in subsection (4), (4A) or (4B), the loss is not to be taken into account under subsection (2) in calculating the attributable income of the CFC for the eligible period.
 (5) A loss for a statutory accounting period is not to be taken into account under subsection  (2) if, assuming that it were a tax loss (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) of the eligible CFC, it would not be taken into account or allowed as a deduction in relation to the eligible period.

where:
"Gross tainted turnover" means the gross tainted turnover of the company of the statutory accounting period.
"Gross turnover" means the gross turnover of the company of the statutory accounting period.
 (3) For the purposes of this Part, the tainted income ratio of a company for a statutory accounting period is taken to be less than 0.05 if both the numerator and the denominator in the applicable fraction are 0.

Gross turnover

 (1) Subject to section  437, for the purposes of this Part, the gross turnover of a company of a statutory accounting period is the sum of:
 (a) the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory accounting period as the gross revenue derived by the company, but not including:
 (i) amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section  436; or
 (ii) amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as revenue in respect of the disposal of assets (other than trading stock or commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts); or
 (iii) amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as revenue from disposing of commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts; or
 (iv) amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as revenue from currency exchange rate fluctuations; and
 (b) the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory accounting period as the amount (if any) by which the sum of the gains derived by the company in the statutory accounting period in respect of the disposal of assets (other than trading stock or commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts) exceeds the losses incurred by the company in the statutory accounting period in respect of the disposal of such assets, but not including amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section  436; and
 (c) the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory accounting period as the amount (if any) by which the gains derived by the company in the statutory accounting period from disposing of commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts exceeds the losses incurred by the company in the statutory accounting period from disposing of commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts, but not including amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section  436; and
 (d) the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory accounting period as the amount (if any) by which the sum of the gains derived by the company in the statutory accounting period from currency exchange rate fluctuations exceeds the losses incurred by the company in the statutory accounting period from currency exchange rate fluctuations, but not including amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section  436.
 (1A) In working out the gross turnover of a company of a statutory accounting period, assume that the amounts shown in the company&#39;s recognised accounts, as mentioned in paragraphs  (1)(b) and (c), for that period had been worked out by also including:
 (a) as gains derived by the company in that period--capital gains the company would have made; and
 (b) as losses incurred by the company in that period--capital losses the company would have made;
in that period because of CGT event J1, if the assumptions in paragraphs 383(a) to (c) had applied.
Note 1: CGT event J1 is about companies ceasing to be related after a roll-over.
Note 2: Basically, the effect of the assumptions in paragraphs 383(a) to (c) is that the company concerned is taken to be a taxpayer and a resident and CGT event J1  may therefore be taken to have happened.
 (2) Subject only to sections  437, 438 and 440, for the purposes of this section, where a company has prepared recognised accounts for a statutory accounting period in accordance with commercially accepted accounting principles, then, in determining whether a particular amount shown in those accounts is covered by an expression used in subsection  (1) (other than an exclusion of amounts shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section  436), the expression concerned is taken to have the same meaning that it has under those accounting principles.
 (3) If:
 (a) arm&#39;s length conditions are taken by Subdivision  815-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to operate for purposes relating to the company; and
 (b) had those conditions operated, an amount described in any of the paragraphs of subsection  (1) as being an amount shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory account period would have been different;
then the different amount is substituted for the amount shown in the recognised accounts.

 (d) so much of a frankable distribution as is either the franked part of the distribution, or the part of the distribution that has been franked with an exempting credit;
 (e) a non-portfolio dividend paid to the company by a company that is a resident of a listed country or unlisted country;
 (g) a premium paid or credited to the company where, because of the application of subsection  148(1), the premium is not allowable as a deduction to the person referred to in subparagraph 148(1)(a)(i) and is not included in the assessable income of the company.
 (2) Where:
 (a) the company receives an attribution account payment, being a dividend, from another entity; and
 (b) the whole or part (in this subsection called the eligible amount) of the attribution account payment is not excluded from the active income test, in relation to the company in relation to the statutory accounting period, under subsection  (1); and
 (c) on the making of the attribution account payment by the other entity, an attribution debit arises for that entity in relation to a taxpayer;
then, for the purposes of this Part, so much of the eligible amount as does not exceed the grossed-up amount of the attribution debit is, in accordance with subparagraph  434(1)(a)(i), excluded (in addition to any other amount that is excluded under subsection (1)) from the active income test in relation to the company in relation to the taxpayer.

 (a) the partnership is to be treated as an entity separate from the company;
 (b) in spite of anything in section  432, the company is not taken to pass the active income test in relation to the statutory accounting period unless:

 (b) if paragraph (1)(d) applies--the amount that would be the CFC&#39;s distributable profits at the residence -change time if:

then, for the purposes of this Act, the tax detriment is taken to be reduced by that amount.
 (4) Where:
 (a) as a result of the amount being included as mentioned in subsection  (1), there is, apart from this subsection, a tax detriment for:
 (i) the trustee of the Australian trust; or
 (ii) the trustee of another trust (in this subsection called the ultimate trust), where the tax detriment occurred because there were one or more partnerships or trusts (but not companies) interposed between the trustee and the Australian partnership or the Australian trust; and
 (b) the tax detriment would be reduced by an amount if it were recalculated on the assumption that:
 (i) section 98 applied only to so much of a beneficiary&#39;s share of the net income of the Australian trust or the ultimate trust as is attributable to periods when the beneficiary was a Part  X Australian resident; and
 (ii) sections 99 and 99A applied only to the Australian trust or the ultimate trust if it were a resident trust estate within the meaning of Division  6 of Part III;
then, for the purposes of this Act, the tax detriment is taken to be reduced by that amount.

Effect of reducing section CGT event J1 amount

 (1) This section applies in either of the following cases:
 (a) one or more schemes or arrangements have the effect of reducing the attribution percentage of an attributable taxpayer in relation to a company that is a CFC, and are intended by the attributable taxpayer or an associate of the attributable taxpayer to have that effect;
 (b) a company ceases to be a CFC in relation to a particular taxpayer.
 (2) Work out the amount (if any) included under this Division  in the taxpayer&#39;s assessable income because of CGT event J1 (as it notionally happens to the company under Division 7) as though the reduction or cessation had not happened.
Note: CGT event J1 is about companies ceasing to be related after a roll-over.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936
- SECT 461
Reduction of disposal consideration or capital proceeds if attributed income not distributed

 (1) If:
 (a) it is necessary, for the purposes of applying a provision of this Act in the assessment of a taxpayer for a year of income, to take into account:
 (i) the amount of consideration received, entitled to be received or taken to have been received, by the taxpayer in respect of the disposal of an asset; or
 (ii) the capital proceeds from a CGT event happening in relation to a CGT asset;
  being an asset that is an interest in an attribution account entity (the disposal entity); and
 (b) immediately before the disposal or CGT event takes place, either or both of the following conditions are satisfied:
 (i) there is an attribution surplus for the disposal entity in relation to the taxpayer;
 (ii) there is an attribution surplus for one or more other attribution account entities in relation to the taxpayer, where each such entity is one in which the taxpayer has an indirect attribution account interest held through the disposal entity;
then, for the purposes of this Act:
 (c) the consideration or capital proceeds that, apart from this section, would be taken into account under the provision referred to in paragraph  (a) in respect of the disposal or CGT event is, subject to subsection (3), taken to be reduced by so much of the amount of the attribution surplus, or sum of the attribution surpluses, as the case requires; and
 (d) an attribution debit is taken to arise at the time of the disposal or the CGT event under section  372, in relation to the taxpayer, for each attribution account entity (the surplus entity) in relation to which there is a surplus to which paragraph  (c) applies; and
 (e) the amount of the attribution debit is equal to so much of the surplus as is taken into account under paragraph (c); and
 (f) there is no grossed-up amount in relation to the attribution debit under section  373.
 (3) For the purposes of paragraph  (1)(c):
 (a) if the disposal of the asset or the CGT event causes the taxpayer&#39;s attribution account percentage for a surplus entity to be reduced by a proportion, then only that proportion of the attribution surplus for the entity is, subject to this subsection, to be taken into account under that paragraph; and
 (b) if there is only one attribution surplus referred to in that paragraph and (after any application of paragraph  (a) of this subsection) it exceeds the consideration from the disposal or the capital proceeds from the CGT event, then only so much of the surplus as does not exceed that consideration or those capital proceeds is to be taken into account under paragraph  (1)(c); and
 (c) where there are 2 or more attribution surpluses referred to in paragraph  (1)(c) and (after any application of paragraph (a) of this subsection) their sum exceeds the consideration from the disposal or the capital proceeds from the CGT event, then:
 (i) if the taxpayer makes an election that, for the purposes of this paragraph, a part of each surplus (after any application of paragraph  (a)) such that the sum of the amounts to which the election relates equals that consideration or those capital proceeds--only the part to which the election relates of each surplus is to be taken into account under paragraph  (1)(c); or
 (ii) if subparagraph  (i) does not apply--only a proportion of each surplus (after any application of paragraph (a)) is to be taken into account under paragraph (1)(c), being the proportion calculated using the formula:
  
  where:
  consideration means the amount of the consideration or the capital proceeds.
  total surplus means the sum of the attribution surpluses (after any application of paragraph (a)).
 (4) An election for the purposes of paragraph  (3)(c) must be made on or before the date of lodgment of the taxpayer&#39;s return of income for the year of income referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or within such further period after the lodgment of the return as the Commissioner allows.
 (4A) In determining, for the purposes of this section, whether there was an attribution surplus immediately before a CGT event, and the amount of such a surplus, also take into account any attribution credit that later arises because the CGT event caused section  104-175 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (as it notionally applies to the CGT event entity under Division  7) to operate.
 (5) In this section:
"interest", in relation to an attribution account entity, means:
 (a) if the entity is a company--an interest in shares in the company, or an entitlement to acquire such an interest; or
 (b) if the entity is a partnership--an interest of a partner in the profits or property of the partnership, or an entitlement of a partner to acquire such an interest; or
 (c) if the entity is a trust--an entitlement of a beneficiary to a share of the income or corpus of the trust, or an entitlement of a beneficiary to acquire such an entitlement.

57-1  What this Division  is about
This Division is about the income tax treatment of a taxpayer whose income ceases to be wholly exempt. Broadly, income, outgoings, gains and losses are attributed to the periods before and after the loss of full exemption.
Subdivision 57-A--Key concepts
57-5  Entities to which this Division  applies
  If:
 (a) at a particular time, all of the income of a taxpayer is wholly exempt from income tax; and
 (b) immediately after that time, the taxpayer&#39;s income becomes to any extent assessable income;
then:
 (c) the taxpayer is a transition taxpayer; and
 (d) the time when the taxpayer&#39;s income becomes to that extent assessable is the transition time; and
 (e) the year of income in which the transition time occurs is the transition year for the taxpayer.
Subdivision 57-B--Predecessors of the transition taxpayer
57-10  Activities of transition taxpayer&#39;s predecessor attributed to transition taxpayer
 (1) If:
 (a) at the transition time, the transition taxpayer performs particular functions or carries on particular activities; and
 (b) during any period before the transition taxpayer first began to perform the functions or carry on the activities, an exempt government entity performed those same functions or carried on those same activities; and
 (c) at the end of the period, responsibility for performing the functions or carrying on the activities was transferred, either directly or through one or more other exempt government entities, to the transition taxpayer;
this Division applies as if, during that period, anything done by or to the exempt government entity in performing those functions or carrying on those activities had instead been done by or to the transition taxpayer.
Note: As a result of this provision, the transition taxpayer may for example be able to deduct after the transition time, under Division  40 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as modified by Subdivision 57-J of this Schedule, a portion of allowable capital expenditure incurred before the transition time by an exempt government entity whose functions were transferred to the transition taxpayer.
 (2) An exempt government entity is:
 (a) the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or
 (b) an STB, within the meaning of Division  1AB of Part III, that is exempt from tax under that Division.
Subdivision 57-C--Time when income derived
57-15  Time when income derived
 (1) To the extent that income derived by the transition taxpayer before the transition time is in respect of:
 (a) services rendered; or
 (b) goods provided; or
 (c) the doing of any other thing;
at or after the transition time, the income is treated for the purposes of this Act as having been derived at the time the services were rendered, the goods were provided or the thing was done, as the case requires.
 (2) To the extent that income derived by the transition taxpayer at or after the transition time is in respect of:
 (a) services rendered; or
 (b) goods provided; or
 (c) the doing of any other thing;
before the transition time, the income is treated for the purposes of this Act as having been derived before that time.
Subdivision 57-D--Time when losses and outgoings incurred
57-20  Time when losses and outgoings incurred
 (1) To the extent that a loss or outgoing (within the meaning of section  51 of this Act or section 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, as appropriate) incurred by the transition taxpayer before the transition time is in respect of:
 (a) services rendered; or
 (b) goods provided; or
 (c) the doing of any other thing;
at or after the transition time, the loss or outgoing is treated for the purposes of this Act as having been incurred at the time the services were rendered, the goods were provided or the thing was done, as the case requires.
 (2) To the extent that a loss or outgoing (within the meaning of section  51 of this Act or section 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, as appropriate) incurred by the transition taxpayer at or after the transition time is in respect of:
 (a) services rendered; or
 (b) goods provided; or
 (c) the doing of any other thing;
before the transition time, the loss or outgoing is treated for the purposes of this Act as having been incurred before that time.
Subdivision 57-E--Assets and liabilities
57-25  Deemed disposal and re-acquisition of assets
 (1) This section applies to:
 (a) the disposal of an asset by the transition taxpayer after the transition time; and
 (b) a CGT event that happens after the transition time in relation to an asset owned by the transition taxpayer;
where the transition taxpayer owned the asset at all times from the transition time until the disposal or the CGT event.
Deemed disposal and re-purchase
 (2) Subject to subsection  (5), in determining for the purposes of this Act (other than the excluded provisions mentioned in subsection (4)) whether an amount is included in, or allowable as a deduction from, the assessable income of the transition taxpayer in respect of the disposal, the transition taxpayer is taken:
 (a) to have sold, immediately before the transition time, each of its assets; and
 (b) to have purchased each of its assets again at the transition time for consideration equal to the asset&#39;s adjusted market value at the transition time.
 (2A) For the purposes of Parts  3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about CGT), in determining whether the transition taxpayer makes a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event that happens after the transition time in relation to an asset referred to in subsection  (1), the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset (at the transition time) is its adjusted market value at that time.
 (3) An asset&#39;s adjusted market value at the transition time is the asset&#39;s market value at that time:
 (a) reduced by any amount of income received or receivable by the transition taxpayer in respect of the asset at or after the transition time that:
 (i) because of subsection  57-15(2); or
 (ii) because all of the income of the transition taxpayer was wholly exempt from income tax before the transition time;
  is not included in the transition taxpayer&#39;s assessable income; and
 (b) increased by any amount of income received or receivable by the transition taxpayer in respect of the asset before the transition time that:
 (i) because of subsection  57-15(1); or
 (ii) because the transition taxpayer&#39;s income ceased to be exempt from income tax at the transition time;
  is included in the transition taxpayer&#39;s assessable income.
Note: If the asset is, or is part of, a Division 230 financial arrangement, section  57-32 may affect how the market value of the asset is worked out.
Excluded provisions
 (4) For the purposes of subsection  (2), the excluded provisions are:
 (e) former Division 10B of Part  III of this Act (about industrial property); and
 (f) former Division 10BA of Part  III of this Act (about Australian films); and
 (ga) Division 40 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about capital allowances); and
 (i) Division 43 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about deductions for capital works); and
 (j) section 70-120 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about deducting capital costs of acquiring trees);
 (la) Division 373 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about intellectual property).
Listed provisions not affected
 (5) If the transition taxpayer:
 (a) acquired an asset (whether before the transition time or otherwise) before the commencement of a provision listed in subsection  (6); and
 (b) after acquiring the asset, owned the asset at all times before the transition time;
the deemed acquisition of the asset under subsection (2) does not affect the operation of the listed provision.

Avoidance of doubt--debt write-off
 (7) To avoid doubt, an effect of subsection  (2) is that the sum of all allowable deductions (if any) in respect of the writing off as bad of the whole or part of a debt to which that subsection applies will not exceed the market value of the debt at the transition time.
Avoidance of doubt--disposal need not involve an alienation
 (8) To avoid doubt, an asset may be disposed of for the purposes of this section whether or not the disposal involves alienating the asset.
57-30  Deemed cessation and re-assumption of liabilities
 (1) Subject to subsection  (3), for the purposes of determining a deduction allowable to, or an amount included in the assessable income of, the transition taxpayer after the transition time in respect of the satisfaction of a liability owed by the transition taxpayer immediately before the transition time, the transition taxpayer is taken:
 (a) to have ceased immediately before the transition time to have any liabilities; and
 (b) to have assumed each of its liabilities again at the transition time in return for consideration equal to the adjusted market value (see subsection  (2)) at that time of the right or other asset, corresponding to the liability, that was held by the person to whom the liability was owed.
 (2) The adjusted market value of the corresponding right or other asset is the market value of that right or asset at the transition time:
 (a) reduced by any amount paid or that becomes payable by the transition taxpayer in respect of the liability at or after the transition time, where:
 (i) because of subsection  57-20(2); or
 (ii) because all of the transition taxpayer&#39;s income was wholly exempt from income tax before the transition time;
  the amount is not an allowable deduction; and
 (b) increased by any amount paid or that became payable by the transition taxpayer in respect of the liability before the transition time, where:
 (i) because of subsection  57-20(1); or
 (ii) because the transition taxpayer&#39;s income ceased to be exempt from income tax at the transition time;
  the amount is an allowable deduction.
Note: If the liability is, or is part of, a Division 230 financial arrangement, section  57-32 may affect how the market value of the corresponding right or other asset is worked out.

 (1) This section applies in relation to an asset (the subject asset) held by an entity (the holder) if:
 (a) the subject asset is:
 (i) covered by subsection  57-25(1); or
 (ii) a right, or other asset, corresponding to a liability covered by subsection  57-30(1); and
 (b) the subject asset, or the corresponding liability for the subject asset, is or is part of a Division  230 financial arrangement at the transition time; and
 (c) when the arrangement was entered into:
 (i) the parties to the arrangement were not dealing at arm&#39;s length (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) in relation to the subject asset; or
 (ii) if the subject asset gives rise to an interest that is not an equity interest in an entity--the return on the interest would reasonably be expected to be less than the benchmark rate of return (within the meaning of that Act) for the interest.
 (2) For the purposes mentioned in subsection  (3), assume at the transition time that the market value of the subject asset is the total amount (the initial amount) of the financial benefits (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) that the holder provided in relation to the subject asset before the transition time:
 (a) reduced by:
 (i) repayments of principal made in relation to the subject asset before the transition time; and
 (ii) the amount of any impairment (within the meaning of the accounting principles (within the meaning of that Act)) of the subject asset at the transition time; and
 (b) increased by the amount of the cumulative amortisation (worked out using the effective interest method recognised by the accounting principles (within the meaning of that Act)) of any difference at the transition time between:
 (i) the initial amount; and
 (ii) the amount payable on the maturity of the subject asset.
 (3) Subsection (2) has effect for the purposes of working out the subject asset&#39;s adjusted market value under section  57-25 or 57-30 for use when applying Division  230 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to the subject asset or the corresponding liability for the subject asset.

 (b) the corresponding liability for a right, or other asset, covered by subsection  57-30(1) to which section 57-32 applies.
Note: Section 57-32 applies if the asset or liability is or is part of a Division  230 financial arrangement.
 (2) For the purposes of section  230-60 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, assume the following:
 (a) in the case of an asset--that the transition taxpayer acquired the asset at the transition time in return for the transition taxpayer starting to have an obligation to provide one or more financial benefits in relation to the Division  230 financial arrangement;
 (b) in the case of a liability--that the transition taxpayer started to have the liability at the transition time in return for the transition taxpayer starting to have a right to receive one or more financial benefits under the Division  230 financial arrangement.

Subdivision 57-F--Superannuation deductions
57-40  Contributions under defined benefit superannuation schemes
 (1) This section applies to a deduction allowable apart from this Subdivision  to the transition taxpayer under section 290-60 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 for a contribution made to a fund in relation to a person if:
 (a) the person was an employee of the transition taxpayer at any time before or after the transition time; and
 (b) the contribution was made under a defined benefit superannuation scheme (within the meaning of section  6A of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992).
Deduction allowable only if sum of all deductions exceeds defined benefit threshold amount
 (2) The deduction is not allowable for a year of income if the sum of all deductions of the transition taxpayer to which this section applies for the year of income is less than or equal to the defined benefit threshold amount (see subsection  (4)) for the year of income.
Amount of deduction not allowable
 (3) If the sum is greater than that amount, so much of the deduction as is worked out using the following formula is not allowable:
  
Meaning of defined benefit threshold amount
 (4) The defined benefit threshold amount for a year of income is:
 (a) if the year of income is the transition year--the unfunded liability amount (see subsection  (5)); or
 (b) in any other case--that amount as reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies, that, because of subsection  (2) or (3), have not (disregarding section 57-55) been allowable to the transition taxpayer for all previous years of income.
Meaning of unfunded liability amount
 (5) The unfunded liability amount is the value, worked out as at the transition time in accordance with actuarial principles, of the liabilities of the transition taxpayer to provide superannuation benefits for, or for dependants of, employees of the transition taxpayer, where the liabilities:
 (a) had accrued as at the transition time; and
 (b) were, according to actuarial principles, unfunded at that time; and
 (c) were liabilities only under defined benefit superannuation schemes.
57-45  Deduction for surplus to meet defined benefit superannuation scheme liabilities
  If:
 (a) at the transition time, according to a particular defined benefit superannuation scheme&#39;s accounts, an amount is available to meet liabilities of the transition taxpayer under the scheme to provide superannuation benefits for, or for dependants of, employees of the transition taxpayer; and
 (b) the amount exceeds the total value (as worked out according to actuarial principles) of the liabilities of that kind that have accrued as at the transition time; and
 (c) before the transition time, the transition taxpayer makes a written election that the excess is to be used solely to meet liabilities of that kind accruing after the transition time, and the excess is later used solely to meet such liabilities;
the excess is an allowable deduction of the transition taxpayer for the transition year.
57-50  Contributions generally
 (1) This section applies to a deduction allowable apart from this Subdivision  to the transition taxpayer under section 290-60 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 for a contribution made to a fund in relation to a person if the person was an employee of the transition taxpayer at any time before or after the transition time.
Deduction allowable only if sum of all deductions exceeds general superannuation threshold amount
 (2) The deduction is not allowable for a year of income if the sum of all deductions of the transition taxpayer to which this section applies for the year of income is less than or equal to the general superannuation threshold amount (see subsection  (4)) for the year of income.
Amount of deduction not allowable
 (3) If the sum is greater than the general superannuation threshold amount, so much of the deduction as is worked out using the following formula is not allowable:
  
Meaning of general superannuation threshold amount
 (4) The general superannuation threshold amount for a year of income is:
 (a) if the year of income is the transition year--the undischarged superannuation liability amount (see subsection  (5)); or
 (b) in any other case--the amount applicable under paragraph  (a), reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies that, because of subsection (2) or (3), have not (disregarding section  57-55) been allowable to the transition taxpayer for all previous years of income.
Meaning of undischarged superannuation liability amount
 (5) This is how to work out the transition taxpayer&#39;s undischarged superannuation liability amount:
Step 1. For each person who was an employee of the transition taxpayer at any time before the transition time, take the sum of:
 (a) if the whole or any part of the person&#39;s period of employment with the transition taxpayer took place before the beginning of the superannuation guarantee period (see subsection  (6)) and there were one or more required award etc. contribution amounts (see subsection (7)) in respect of any of that whole or part--that amount or those amounts; and (b) if, for the whole or any part or parts of the superannuation guarantee period, there were one or more required award etc. contribution amounts that were greater than the required superannuation guarantee contribution amount or amounts (see subsection  (8))--that greater amount or those greater amounts; and (c) if, for the whole or any part or parts of the superannuation guarantee period, either there was no required award etc. contribution amount or there was such an amount but it was not greater than the required superannuation guarantee contribution amount--the required superannuation guarantee contribution amount for the whole or the part of the period, or the sum of the required superannuation guarantee contribution amounts for the parts of the period, as the case may be.
Step 2. Reduce the sum from Step 1 by the sum of amounts that the transition taxpayer actually contributed before the start of the transition year:
 (a) in payment of required award etc. contribution amounts or required superannuation guarantee contribution amounts for the employee that are included in the sum in Step 1; or (b) voluntarily to a superannuation fund for the purpose of providing superannuation benefits for the employee, or dependants of the employee;
 in respect of any period of employment of the employee with the transition taxpayer before the transition time.Step 3. If the result after applying Step 2 for a particular employee is less than nil, it is nil instead.Step 4. Add up the results for all of the employees. This final sum is the transition taxpayer&#39;s undischarged superannuation liability amount.
Meaning of superannuation guarantee period
 (6) The superannuation guarantee period is the period beginning on 1 July 1992 and ending at the transition time.
Meaning of required award etc. contribution amount
 (7) A required award etc. contribution amount is an amount required to be contributed to a superannuation fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee:
 (a) by an industrial award; or
 (b) by an occupational superannuation arrangement; or
 (c) by a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or
 (d) otherwise.
Meaning of required superannuation guarantee contribution amount
 (8) A required superannuation guarantee contribution amount is an amount that an employer would need to contribute in respect of a period so as not to have a superannuation guarantee shortfall under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 in respect of that period.
Note: The relevant periods for which shortfalls are or were calculated under that Act are quarters (from 1  July 1993 onwards) or half-years (from 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1993).
57-52  Section 57-50 does not apply if there is a surplus at transition time
  Section 57-50 does not apply to a deduction of the kind mentioned in subsection  57-50(1) if:
 (a) at the transition time, according to the accounts of the fund concerned, an amount is available to meet liabilities of the transition taxpayer in relation to the fund to provide superannuation benefits for, or for dependants of, employees of the transition taxpayer; and
 (b) the amount exceeds the value (as worked out according to actuarial principles) of the liabilities of that kind that have accrued as at the transition time.
57-55  Deductions reduced under both sections  57-40 and 57-50
  If the amount of a deduction otherwise allowable to the transition taxpayer in respect of a contribution to a fund is required to be reduced under both sections  57-40 and 57-50:
 (a) if the reduction is of a different amount--the amount is reduced only under that section that requires the greater reduction; or
 (b) if the reduction is of the same amount--the amount is reduced only under section  57-40.
Subdivision 57-G--Denial of certain deductions
57-60  Effect of pre-transition time accrued leave entitlements

Meaning of leave threshold amount
 (4) The leave threshold amount for a year of income is:
 (a) if the year of income is the transition year--the (pre -transition time service) leave amount (see subsection (5)) of the transition taxpayer; or
 (b) in any other case--that amount as reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies that, because of subsection  (2) or (3), have not been allowable to the transition taxpayer for all previous years of income.
Meaning of (pre-transition time service) leave amount
 (5) The (pre-transition time service) leave amount of the transition taxpayer is the sum of the following amounts:
 (a) the amount that would be payable by the transition taxpayer in respect of annual leave and long service leave if, at the transition time, all employees of the transition taxpayer began to take all leave of that kind that they were eligible to take; and
 (b) if the transition taxpayer elects, in accordance with subsection  (6), that this paragraph applies--the amount that, according to actuarial principles, would need to be set aside at the transition time to meet all obligations of the transition taxpayer that might reasonably be expected to arise after that time to make annual leave payments and long service leave payments (other than in respect of leave taken into account under paragraph  (a)) for periods of service of employees occurring before the transition time; and
 (c) if paragraph (b) does not apply--the present value, at the transition time, of all annual leave payments and long service leave payments (other than in respect of leave taken into account under paragraph  (a)) that the transition taxpayer would become liable to make after that time in respect of periods of service of employees occurring before that time if all such leave became eligible to be taken.

 (a) if the year of income is the transition year--the pre -transition doubtful debt limit (see subsection (5)); or
 (b) in any other case--that limit as reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies that, because of subsection  (2) or (3), have not been allowable to the transition taxpayer for all previous years of income.
Meaning of pre-transition doubtful debt limit
 (5) The pre-transition doubtful debt limit is the total of the amounts that, under generally accepted accounting principles, would be the appropriate doubtful debt provisions in relation to all debts owed to the transition taxpayer as at the transition time.
Reduction of limit for excess recovery
 (6) If:
 (a) at the transition time, a debt is owed to the transition taxpayer; and
 (b) the sum of:
 (i) the amount (if any) that, under generally accepted accounting principles, would be the appropriate doubtful debt provision in relation to the debt as at the transition time; and
 (ii) any amounts later recovered in respect of the debt;
  exceeds the amount of the debt;

Reduction of limit if debt later disposed of
 (7) If:

57-90  Post-transition deductions--assume that the transition taxpayer had never been exempt
  In working out the transition taxpayer&#39;s allowable deductions under a modified deduction rule for the transition year or a later year of income, assume that the modified deduction rule had applied at all times before the transition time as if the transition taxpayer&#39;s income had never been exempt from income tax.
57-95  Amount of deduction not allowable for transition year
 (1) If, apart from this section, an amount would be an allowable deduction under a modified deduction rule for the transition year in respect of expenditure incurred before the transition time (whether or not during the transition year), only so much of the amount as is worked out using the following formula is so allowable:
  
where:
"post-expenditure part" means:

  In working out the transition taxpayer&#39;s allowable deductions under a modified deduction rule:
 (a) assume that the transition taxpayer did not, at any time, make any election or declaration, or give any notice, under the rule in relation to a year of income before the transition year; and
 (b) any election or declaration (other than one under former subsection  124ZADA(1)) the transition taxpayer makes, or any notice the transition taxpayer gives, under the rule in relation to the transition year has no effect in so far as it relates to expenditure incurred before the transition time.
57-105  Special rules for mining and quarrying
Exploration and prospecting--assume no expenditure
 (1) In working out the transition taxpayer&#39;s allowable deductions under the former Subdivision  330-A or 330-C or Division 40 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, assume that the transition taxpayer incurred no expenditure on exploration and prospecting before the transition time.
Assume that no excess deductions available
 (2) In working out the transition taxpayer&#39;s allowable deductions under the former Subdivision  330-A or 330-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, assume that, for each year of income before the transition year, the transition taxpayer&#39;s assessable income would have exceeded the total of the transition taxpayer&#39;s deductions for the year.

Subdivision 57-K--Balancing adjustments
57-110  Apportionment of balancing adjustments
 (1) If, apart from this subsection, a balancing adjustment provision (see subsection  (2)) would:

 (b) allow an amount as a deduction from the transition taxpayer&#39;s assessable income for the transition year or a later year of income in respect of particular expenditure;
then only so much of the amount as is worked out using the following formula is so included or allowable:

where:
"actual deductions" is the sum of all deductions actually allowed or allowable to the transition taxpayer for the expenditure under the deduction rule to which the balancing adjustment provision relates (see subsection  (2)).
"notional deductions" is the sum of all deductions for the expenditure that would have been allowable to the transition taxpayer under the deduction rule to which the balancing adjustment provision relates, if the transition taxpayer had never been wholly exempt from income tax.
 (2) Each balancing adjustment provision and its related deduction rule are shown in an item of the table. Provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 are shown in ordinary text, and provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are shown in bold.

Subdivision 57-L--Trading stock
57-115  Modification of trading stock provisions
 (1) For the purposes of applying Division  70 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in relation to the transition year, the only trading stock of the transition taxpayer that is to be taken into account under section  70-35 of that Act as being on hand at the beginning of the transition year is such trading stock as was on hand at the transition time.
 (2) For the purpose of working out the value at which the trading stock is to be taken into account, the year of income preceding the transition year is taken to have ended immediately before the transition time.
Note: The value of trading stock on hand at the beginning of the transition year will, under section  70-40 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, be the same as at the end of the preceding year of income.
 (3) If:
 (a) the basis of valuation of the trading stock at the end of the transition year is cost; and
 (b) the basis of valuation at the beginning of the transition year is different;
then, for the purposes of the valuation at the end of the transition year, the cost of the trading stock for the purposes of Division 70 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is taken to be equal to the value at which it was taken into account at the beginning of the transition year.

 (c) immediately before the transition time:
 (i) there was a franking surplus of the transition taxpayer that was less than the total of the pre -transition time components of all of the debits; or

 (a) if the amount worked out under subsection  (4) exceeds the amount of the loss to be reduced under paragraph (2)(a)--the transition taxpayer is taken, for the purposes of making the balancing adjustment, to have made a gain equal to the amount of the excess; or
 (b) if the amount worked out under subsection  (4) exceeds the amount of the gain to be reduced under paragraph (2)(b)--the transition taxpayer is taken, for the purposes of making the balancing adjustment, to have made a loss equal to the amount of the excess; or
 (c) if when applying the method statement no balancing adjustment is made in relation to the financial arrangement--the transition taxpayer is taken, for the purposes of making the balancing adjustment, to have:
 (i) if the transition taxpayer is the holder of the subject asset--made a gain equal to the amount worked out under subsection  (4); or
 (ii) if the transition taxpayer is the holder of the corresponding liability for the subject asset--made a loss equal to the amount worked out under subsection  (4).
 (4) For the purposes of subsections  (2) and (3), the amount is the difference between:
 (a) the amount that the transition taxpayer would need to receive or pay under the financial arrangement without an amount being assessable income of, or deductible to, the transition taxpayer if the subject asset, or the corresponding liability for the subject asset, were disposed of at the time the balancing adjustment is made; and
 (b) the amount that the transition taxpayer would need to receive or pay under the financial arrangement without an amount being assessable income of, or deductible to, the transition taxpayer if:
 (i) the subject asset, or the corresponding liability for the subject asset, were disposed of at the time the balancing adjustment is made; and
 (ii) the assumptions in subsection  (5) were made.
 (5) The assumptions referred to in subparagraph  (4)(b)(ii) are that, when the financial arrangement was entered into:
 (a) the parties to the arrangement were dealing with each other at arm&#39;s length (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) in relation to the arrangement; and
 (b) if the arrangement gives rise to an interest that is not an equity interest in an entity--the return on the interest would reasonably be expected to be equal to the benchmark rate of return (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) for the interest.
 (6) This section applies despite section  230-510 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.

 (a) if this section is being applied for the purposes of section  266-25--section 267-20 would not have prevented the non-fixed trust from deducting the tax loss concerned if it, rather than the fixed trust, had incurred the loss; or
 (b) if this section is being applied for the purposes of section  266-30--section 267-60 does not require the non-fixed trust to work out its net income and tax loss for the income year under Division  268; or
 (c) if this section is being applied for the purposes of section  266-35--section 267-25, or section 267-65, as the case requires, would not have prevented the non -fixed trust from deducting the amount concerned if it, rather than the fixed trust, would otherwise be entitled to deduct the amount.
266-50  Deducting part of a tax loss
 (1) If section  266-25 prevents the fixed trust from deducting a tax loss, it can deduct the part of the tax loss that is attributable to a part of the loss year.
 (2) However, the trust can do this only if, assuming that that part of the loss year had been treated as the whole of the loss year for the purposes of sections  266-40 and 266-45, the trust would have been entitled to deduct the tax loss.
266-55  Information about non-fixed trusts with interests in fixed trust
Notice about non-resident non-fixed trust
 (1) The Commissioner may give the trustee of a fixed trust a notice in accordance with section  266-60 if the requirements of subsections (2) to (5) of this section are met.

Second requirement
 (3) In order to determine whether it meets the conditions in section  266-45, the Commissioner must need information about a non-fixed trust mentioned in subsection  266-45(5).
Third requirement
 (4) When the Commissioner gives the notice:
 (a) a trustee of the non-fixed trust must be a non -resident; or
 (b) the central management and control of the non -fixed trust must be outside Australia.

Application of Division 268
 (5) If, because of subsection  (4), the fixed trust is required to work out under Division 268 its net income and tax loss for the income year mentioned in subsection  266-55(2), that Division is to be applied as if Subdivision 268-B required the income year to be divided into such periods as would result in the highest possible net income for the income year.
No offences or penalties
 (6) To avoid doubt, subsections  (4) and (5) do not cause the trustee of the fixed trust to commit any offence or be liable to any penalty under Part 4-25 in Schedule  1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 for deducting the amount concerned, or for not working out the trust&#39;s net income and tax loss under Division  268, in its return.

 (a) the latest time, after the test time mentioned in that section, that would result in the same individuals having more than a 50% stake in the income or the capital, as the case requires, of the trust during the whole of the period; or
 (b) the earliest time when a group begins to control the trust directly or indirectly.

 (1) A notional loss or notional net income of the trust must be worked out for each period into which the income year has been divided in accordance with Subdivision  268-B.
 (2) The trust has a notional loss for a period if the deductions attributed to the period under section  268-35 exceed the assessable income attributed to the period under section 268-40. The notional loss is the amount of the excess.
For a period during which the trust was in partnership, the notional loss is worked out under Subdivision 268-D.
 (3) On the other hand, if that assessable income exceeds those deductions, the trust has a notional net income for the period, equal to the excess.
For a period during which the trust was in partnership, the notional net income is worked out under Subdivision 268-D.
 (4) If the trust has a notional loss for none of the periods in the income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the trust&#39;s net income for the income year is calculated in the usual way.
The usual way of working out net income is set out in section 95.
268-35  How to attribute deductions to periods
 (1) The trust&#39;s deductions for the income year are attributed to periods in the income year as follows.
 (2) The following deductions are attributed to each period in proportion to the length of the period:
 (aa) deductions for the decline in value of a depreciating asset;
See Division 40 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (c) deductions for expenditure, deductions for which are spread over 2 or more years, but not full year deductions (see subsection  (5));
 (d) deductions for expenditure of capital monies in connection with an Australian film.
See former section 124ZAFA.
 (3) All other deductions (except full year deductions) are attributed to periods as if each period were an income year.
 (4) Full year deductions are not attributed to any of the periods. They are brought in at a later stage of the process of calculating the trust&#39;s net income for the income year.
 (5) These are full year deductions:
 (a) deductions for bad debts under section  8-1 (about general deductions) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997;
 (b) deductions for bad debts under section  25-35 (about bad debts) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, or for losses on debt/equity swaps under section  63E;
 (c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division  8 (which is about deductions) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division  3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;
 (d) deductions allowable under Division  30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997;
 (e) deductions for payments of pensions, gratuities or retiring allowances under section  25-50 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997;
 (f) deductions for tax losses of earlier income years;
See Division 36 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (j) deductions for farm management deposits.
Note: See Division 393 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 .
 (6) However, a deduction for the balance of capital expenditure is not a full year deduction if the deduction results from the disposal, loss, lapse, termination of use or destruction of the property.
See Subdivision 40-D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
268-40  How to attribute assessable income to periods
 (1) The trust&#39;s assessable income for the income year is attributed to periods in the income year as follows.
 (2) The following amounts are attributed to periods so far as they are reasonably attributable to those periods:
 (a) amounts included in the trust&#39;s assessable income under section  97 (Beneficiary of a trust estate not under a legal disability); or
 (b) amounts included in the trust&#39;s assessable income under section  98A (Non-resident beneficiaries assessable in respect of certain income).
 (3) The following items of assessable income are attributed to each period in proportion to the length of the period:
 (a) insurance recoveries for loss of livestock or trees;
See section 385-130 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (b) amounts included in assessable income as a result of elections relating to the forced disposal of livestock;
See Subdivision 385-E and section 385-160 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 .
 (c) recoupment of mains electricity connection expenditure.
See item 1.25 in section 20-30, which lists deductions for which recoupments are assessable under Subdivision  20-A, of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (4) An amount included in the trust&#39;s assessable income under section  385-185 (Election to defer including profit on second wool clip) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is attributed to the period when the wool would ordinarily have been shorn.
 (5) An amount included in the trust&#39;s assessable income that is a dividend under:
 (a) section 65 (Payments to associated persons); or
 (c) section 109 (Excessive payments to shareholders and associates); or
 (d) Division 7A of Part  III (Distributions to entities connected with a private company);
is attributed to the period when the amount was paid or credited, whichever occurred first.
 (6) All other items of assessable income (except full year amounts) are attributed to periods as if each period were an income year.
 (7) Full year amounts are amounts referred to in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b), so far as they are not reasonably attributable to a period. They are brought in at a later stage of the process of calculating the trust&#39;s net income for the income year.
268-45  How to calculate the trust&#39;s net income for the income year
 (1) The trust&#39;s net income for the income year is worked out as follows.
 (2) Add up the notional net incomes (if any) worked out under section  268-30 or 268-70.
Note: A notional loss for a period is not taken into account, but counts towards the trust&#39;s tax loss for the income year.
 (3) Add the full year amounts referred to in subsection  268-40(7) (if any).
 (4) Subtract the trust&#39;s full -year deductions of these kinds:
 (a) deductions for bad debts under section  8-1 (about general deductions) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997;
 (b) deductions for bad debts under section  25-35 (about bad debts) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997;
 (c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division  8 (which is about deductions) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division  3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;
unless they exceed the total of the notional net incomes and the full year amounts. (If they equal or exceed that total, the trust does not have a net income for the income year.)
 (5) If an amount remains, subtract from it the trust&#39;s other full year deductions, in the order shown in subsection  268-35(5), unless they exceed the amount remaining. (If they equal or exceed that amount, the trust does not have a net income for the income year.)
 (6) The amount (if any) remaining is the trust&#39;s net income for the income year.
268-60  How to work out the trust&#39;s section  36-10 tax loss for the income year
 (1) For the purposes of Division  36 (Tax losses of earlier income years) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, instead of working out the trust&#39;s tax loss for the year under section  36-10 of that Act, it is worked out as follows.
 (2) Total the notional losses.
 (3) Add the amount (if any) by which the trust&#39;s full year deductions of these kinds:
 (a) deductions for bad debts under section  8-1 (about general deductions) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997;
 (b) deductions for bad debts under section  25-35 ( about bad debts) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997;
 (c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division  8 (which is about deductions) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division  3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;
exceed the total of:
 (d) the notional net incomes (if any); and
To work out the notional net income: see sections 268-30 and 268-70.
 (e) the full year amounts referred to in section  268-40 (if any).
 (4) If the trust derived exempt income, subtract its net exempt income as defined in section  36-20 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
 (5) Any amount remaining is the trust&#39;s tax loss for the income year.
To find out how much of the tax loss can be deducted in later income years, see Division 266 or 267.
To find out how to deduct it, see section 36-15 or 36-17 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
Subdivision 268-D--Rules that supplement Subdivision 268-C if the trust is in partnership
268-70  How to calculate the trust&#39;s notional loss or net income for a period when the trust was a partner
 (1) This section applies if at any time during a period the trust was a partner in one or more partnerships.
 (2) The trust has a notional loss for the period if the total (the loss total) of:
 (a) the deductions attributed to the period under section  268-35; and
 (b) the trust&#39;s share of each notional loss (if any) of a partnership for the period;
exceeds the total (the income total) of:
 (c) the assessable income attributed to the period under section  268-40; and
 (d) the trust&#39;s share of each notional net income (if any) of a partnership for the period.
The notional loss is the amount of the excess.
Note: A notional loss is taken into account in working out the trust&#39;s tax loss under section  268-60.
 (3) On the other hand, if the income total exceeds the loss total, the trust has a notional net income for the period, equal to the excess.
Note: A notional net income is taken into account in working out the trust&#39;s net income under section  268-45.
 (4) If the trust has a notional net income for all periods in the income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the trust&#39;s net income for the income year is worked out in the usual way.
The usual way of working out net income is set out in section 95.
268-75  How to calculate the trust&#39;s share of a partnership&#39;s notional loss or notional net income for a period if both entities have the same income year
 (1) This section applies if at any time during a period the trust is a partner in a partnership that has an income year that begins and ends when the trust&#39;s income year begins and ends.
 (2) The partnership&#39;s notional loss or notional net income for the period is worked out in the same way as the notional loss or notional net income of a trust.
 (3) The trust&#39;s share is calculated by dividing:
 (a) the trust&#39;s interest in the partnership&#39;s net income or partnership loss of the income year;
by:
 (b) the amount of that net income or partnership loss;
and expressing the result as a percentage.
 (4) However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a partnership loss, the trust&#39;s share is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to the extent of the trust&#39;s interest in the partnership.
268-80  How to calculate the trust&#39;s share of a partnership&#39;s notional loss or notional net income for a period if the entities have different income years
 (1) This section applies if at any time during a period the trust is a partner in a partnership that has an income year that begins and ends at a different time from when the trust&#39;s income year begins and ends.
 (2) So much of the partnership&#39;s net income or partnership loss of an income year as was derived during the period is a notional net income or notional loss of the partnership for the period. (For the purposes of this subsection, the partnership&#39;s net income or partnership loss is calculated without taking account of the partnership&#39;s full year deductions for that income year.)
Note: The partnership&#39;s full year deductions are dealt with in section  268-85.
 (3) The trust&#39;s share is calculated by dividing:
 (a) the trust&#39;s interest in the partnership&#39;s net income or partnership loss of the income year;
by:
 (b) the amount of that net income or partnership loss;
and expressing the result as a percentage.
268-85  Trust&#39;s full year deductions include a share of partnership&#39;s full year deductions
 (1) This section applies if at any time during the income year the trust is a partner in a partnership that has one or more full year deductions for the income year of the partnership that corresponds to the income year of the trust.
 (2) The partnership&#39;s full year deductions are treated as full year deductions of the trust, but only to the extent of the trust&#39;s share.
 (3) If the partnership&#39;s income year is the same as the trust&#39;s, the trust&#39;s share is calculated by dividing:
 (a) the trust&#39;s interest in the partnership&#39;s net income or partnership loss of the income year;
by:
 (b) the amount of that net income or partnership loss;
and expressing the result as a percentage.
 (4) However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a partnership loss, the trust&#39;s share is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to the extent of the trust&#39;s interest in the partnership.
 (5) If the partnership&#39;s income year does not begin and end at the same time as the trust&#39;s income year, the trust&#39;s share is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances.
Division 269--Concepts and tests applied in Divisions 266 and 267
Subdivision 269-A--Overview of Division
269-5  What this Division is about
This Division explains the following concepts or tests that are used in preceding Divisions of this Schedule:&bull;  abnormal trading;&bull;  50% stake test etc.;&bull;  pattern of distributions test;&bull;  control;&bull;  business continuity test.
Subdivision 269-B--Abnormal trading
269-10  Trading
  A trading in units in a unit trust occurs if there is an issue, redemption or transfer of, or other dealing in, the units.
269-15  Abnormal trading--general
 (1) There is an abnormal trading in units in a unit trust if there is a trading in the units that is abnormal having regard to all relevant factors, including:
 (a) the timing of the trading, when compared to the normal timing for trading in its units; and
 (b) the number of units traded, when compared to the normal number of units traded; and
 (c) any connection between the trading and any other trading in units in the trust; and
 (d) any connection between the trading and a tax loss or other deduction of the trust.
 (2) There may also be an abnormal trading under any of the following provisions.
269-20  Abnormal trading--suspected acquisition or merger
  There is an abnormal trading in units in a unit trust if a trading occurs in its units that the trustee knows or reasonably suspects is part of an acquisition of the trust or merger of the trust with another trust.
269-25  Abnormal trading--5% of units in a single transaction
  There is an abnormal trading in units in a unit trust (other than a wholesale widely held trust) if 5% or more of the units are traded in one transaction.
269-30  Abnormal trading--suspected 5% of units in a series of transactions
 (1) There is an abnormal trading in units in a unit trust (other than a wholesale widely held trust) if the trustee knows or reasonably suspects that a person, or a person and one or more associates of the person, have acquired or redeemed 5% or more of the units in 2 or more transactions and would not have done so if the trust did not have a tax loss or other deduction.
 (2) For the purposes of other provisions of this Schedule, the abnormal trading occurs at the time of the particular transaction that causes the 5% figure to be exceeded.
269-35  Abnormal trading--20% of units traded, issued or redeemed over 60 day period
 (1) There is an abnormal trading in units in a unit trust (other than a wholesale widely held trust) if more than 20% of the units on issue at the end of any 60 day period were traded during the period.
 (2) For the purposes of other provisions of this Schedule, the abnormal trading occurs at the end of the 60 day period.
269-40  Abnormal trading--50% stake not maintained
 (1) There is an abnormal trading in units in a wholesale widely held trust during a period if the trustee knows or reasonably suspects that the same persons did not hold more than 50% of its units at the beginning and end of the period.
 (2) For the purposes of other provisions of this Schedule, the abnormal trading occurs immediately before the end of the period.
269-45  Time at which trustee to have knowledge or suspicion
  For the purposes of section  269-20, 269-30 or 269-40, the trustee must have the knowledge or reasonable suspicion mentioned in that section:
 (a) if the section is being applied in determining for the purposes of section  268-20 whether an abnormal trading occurred--at some time during the income year mentioned in that section; or
 (b) if it is being applied in determining for the purposes of any other provision whether an abnormal trading occurred during a period--at some time during the period.
269-47  Abnormal trading where holding trust
Holding trust and subsidiary trust
 (1) If a unit trust has fixed entitlements directly or indirectly to all of the income and capital of another unit trust:
 (a) the first trust is a holding trust of the second; and
 (b) the second is a subsidiary trust of the first.
Abnormal trading causing or ending holding-subsidiary relationship
 (2) The transaction that causes a trust to become, or to cease to be, a holding trust of a subsidiary trust (the bottom subsidiary trust) is an abnormal trading in units in the bottom subsidiary trust unless:
 (a) the holding trust is itself a subsidiary trust of one or more holding trusts (each of which is a higher holding trust); and
 (b) immediately before and after the transaction, the bottom subsidiary trust is a subsidiary trust of one or more of the higher holding trusts.
Abnormal trading while holding-subsidiary relationship exists
 (3) While one or more trusts are holding trusts of the same subsidiary trust, there is an abnormal trading in units in the subsidiary trust if and only if, and at the time at which, there is an abnormal trading in units in the holding trust that is not itself a subsidiary trust of another holding trust.
269-49  No abnormal trading where proportionate issue of units
  If the issue of units in a unit trust to existing unit holders does not cause each unit holder&#39;s proportion of the total fixed entitlements to shares of the income and capital of the trust to change, then, except for the purposes of section  269-20, the issue is disregarded in determining whether there has been an abnormal trading in units in the unit trust.
Subdivision 269-C--Passing the 50% stake test etc.
269-50  More than a 50% stake in income or capital
More than a 50% stake in income
 (1) If there are individuals who have (between them), directly or indirectly, and for their own benefit, fixed entitlements to a greater than 50% share of the income of a trust, those individuals have more than a 50% stake in the income of the trust.
More than a 50% stake in capital
 (2) If there are individuals who have (between them), directly or indirectly, and for their own benefit, fixed entitlements to a greater than 50% share of the capital of the trust, those individuals have more than a 50% stake in the capital of the trust.
269-55  Passing the 50% stake test
 (1) If, at all times during a period, or at 2 times:
 (a) the same individuals have more than a 50% stake in the income of a trust; and
 (b) the same individuals (who may be different from those in paragraph  (a)) have more than a 50% stake in the capital of the trust;
the trust passes the 50% stake test for the period or in respect of the 2 times.
 (2) If a trust is a widely held unit trust it is taken to pass the 50% stake test for a period or in respect of 2 times if it is reasonable to assume that the requirements of paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) are satisfied in respect of the period or the 2 times.
Subdivision 269-D--Pattern of distributions test
269-60  Pattern of distributions test
  A trust passes the pattern of distributions test for an income year if, before the end of 2 months after the end of the income year:
 (a) the trust distributed directly or indirectly to the same individuals, for their own benefit, a greater than 50% share of all test year distributions of income (see subsection  269-65(1)); and
 (b) the trust distributed directly or indirectly to the same individuals (who may be different from those in paragraph  (a)), for their own benefit, a greater than 50% share of all test year distributions of capital (see subsection  269-65(3)).
269-65  Test year distribution of income or capital
Test year distribution of income
 (1) A test year distribution of income is the total of all distributions of income made by the trust in any of the following periods, provided the period does not begin more than 6 years before the beginning of the income year:
 (a) the period from the beginning of the income year until 2 months after its end;
 (b) if the trust distributed income before the trigger year (see subsection  (2))--the income year, before the trigger year, that is closest to the trigger year;
 (c) if paragraph (b) does not apply and the trust distributed income in the trigger year--the trigger year;
 (d) if neither paragraph  (b) nor paragraph (c) applies--the income year, closest to the trigger year, in which the trust distributed income;
 (e) each intervening income year (if any) between the one in paragraph  (a) and the one in paragraph (b), (c) or (d).
Trigger year
 (2) If this Subdivision  is being applied for the purposes of section 267-20, the trigger year is the loss year mentioned in that section. If it is being applied for the purposes of section  267-25, the trigger year is the year in which the debt mentioned in that section was incurred.
Test year distribution of capital
 (3) Subsection (1) applies in the same way to distributions of capital made by the trust, to determine what is a test year distribution of capital.
269-70  When individual receives different percentages
  For the purposes of section  269-60, if the trust does not distribute to an individual the same percentage of income or capital for every test year distribution, the trust is taken to have distributed to the individual, for every test year distribution, the smallest percentage that it distributed to the individual for any of the test year distributions.
269-75  Incomplete distributions
  For the purposes of section  269-60, if, before the end of 2 months after the end of the income year:
 (a) the trust has distributed directly or indirectly the whole or part of a test year distribution of income or test year distribution of capital to a company, partnership or trust (the entity); and
 (b) an amount (the undistributed amount) consisting of the whole or part of the income or capital so distributed to the entity satisfies the following requirements:
 (i) the amount has not been distributed by the entity; and
 (ii) an individual, directly or indirectly, and for his or her own benefit, has a fixed entitlement to a share of the amount;
the entity is taken to have distributed the share of the undistributed amount to the individual immediately before the end of 2 months after the end of the income year.
269-80  Where individual&#39;s death or breakdown of marriage or relationship
 (1) For the purposes of section  269-60, if:
 (a) the trust distributes, directly or indirectly to an individual as mentioned in that section, income or capital that is included in a test year distribution; and
 (b) a later distribution of income or capital is made that is included in the same or a different test year distribution; and
 (c) either the individual dies before the later distribution is made or:
 (i) before it is made, there is a breakdown in the marriage or relationship (see section  272-140) of the individual; and
 (ii) after the breakdown, no distribution of income or capital of the trust, that is included in a test year distribution, is made directly or indirectly to the individual; and
 (iii) it is reasonable to assume that the breakdown in the marriage or relationship is the reason for no such distribution being made;
then subsections (2) and (3) apply.
 (2) No income or capital distributed to the individual by the trust, directly or indirectly as mentioned in section  269-60, is to be included in any test year distribution.
 (3) If:
 (a) the requirements of subsection  (1) are met because the individual has died; and
 (b) immediately before his or her death, the individual had directly or indirectly, and for his or her own benefit, a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; and
 (c) after the individual&#39;s death, the fixed entitlement is held by a person as trustee of the individual&#39;s estate or by a person who received it as a beneficiary of the estate;
no income or capital distributed to the person as such a trustee or beneficiary, directly or indirectly as mentioned in section 269-60, is to be included in any test year distribution.
269-85  Arrangements to pass pattern of distributions test
 (1) The trust is taken for the purposes of section  269-60 not to have distributed, directly or indirectly to an individual, and for the individual&#39;s own benefit, a share of a test year distribution of income or capital of the trust if the condition in subsection  (2) is met.
 (2) The condition is that an arrangement was entered into where:
 (a) the arrangement in some way (directly or indirectly) related to, affected or depended for its operation on the share or its value; and
 (b) the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the arrangement was to ensure that the trust would meet the condition in subsection  267-30(2).
Subdivision 269-E--Control a non-fixed trust
269-95  Control a non-fixed trust
Basic meaning
 (1) Subject to this section, a group (see subsection  (5)) controls a non-fixed trust if:
 (a) the group has the power, by means of the exercise of a power of appointment or revocation or otherwise, to obtain beneficial enjoyment (directly or indirectly) of the capital or income of the trust; or
 (b) the group is able (directly or indirectly) to control the application of the capital or income of the trust; or
 (c) the group is capable, under a scheme, of gaining the beneficial enjoyment in paragraph  (a) or the control in paragraph (b); or
 (d) the trustee is accustomed, under an obligation or might reasonably be expected, to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes of the group; or
 (e) the group is able to remove or appoint the trustee; or
 (f) the group acquires more than a 50% stake in the income or capital of the trust.
Replacement group after death etc.
 (2) The consequences set out in subsection  (3) apply if:
 (a) a group (the original group) ceases to control a non-fixed trust only because of the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship of the individual comprising, or an individual included in, the group; and
 (b) another group (the replacement group) begins to control the trust within the following period (whether or not any other group controlled the trust in the interim):
 (i) one year after the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship; or
 (ii) such longer period as the Commissioner determines in relation to the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship; and
 (c) the replacement group consists of:
 (i) if the individual who died or became incapacitated or whose marriage or relationship broke down comprised the original group--one or more individuals who are members of the individual&#39;s family (see section  272-95); or
 (ii) in any other case--one or more such individuals together with all of the persons who were members of the original group, other than any individual who has died or become incapacitated or whose marriage or relationship has broken down; and
 (d) the replacement group began to control the trust only because of the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship of the individual; and
 (e) disregarding any individual who died or became incapacitated or whose marriage or relationship broke down and the one or more individuals covered by paragraph  (c)--the beneficiaries of the trust immediately before the original group ceased to control the trust are the beneficiaries of the trust immediately after the replacement group begins to control the trust.
Consequences of subsection (2)
 (3) For the purposes of subsection  (2), the consequences are that:
 (a) the replacement group is taken to have controlled the trust from the time when the original group began to control it until the time when the replacement group actually began to control it; and
 (b) the original group is taken not to have controlled the trust; and
 (c) if:
 (i) a person or persons (other than a replacement group) began to control the trust at some time during the period from the time the original group ceased to control the trust until the replacement group began to do so; and
 (ii) the person or persons began to control the trust only because of the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship of the individual; and
 (iii) the control did not continue after the replacement group began to control the trust;
  the person or persons are taken not to have controlled the trust.
Deemed absence of control
 (4) If:
 (a) at a particular time, a group controls a non -fixed trust; and
 (b) the Commissioner, having regard to:
 (i) the identity of the beneficiaries of the trust at any time before and at any time after the group began to control the trust; and
 (ii) all other relevant circumstances;
  considers that it is reasonable that the group be taken not to control the trust at the particular time;
the group is taken not to control the trust at the particular time.
Group
 (5) A group is:
 (a) a person; or
 (b) a person and one or more associates; or
 (c) 2 or more associates of a person.
Subdivision 269-F--Business continuity test
269-100  Passing the business continuity test
Basic meaning
 (1) A listed widely held trust passes the business continuity test during a period (the business continuity test period) in relation to a time (the test time) if throughout the business continuity test period it carries on the same business as it carried on immediately before the test time.
Relevance of being a trust
 (2) The mere fact of being a trust does not mean that the trust cannot carry on a business.
First exception
 (3) However, the trust does not pass the business continuity test under this section if, at any time during the business continuity test period, it derives assessable income from:
 (a) a business of a kind that it did not carry on before the test time; or
 (b) a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations before the test time.
Second exception
 (4) The trust also does not pass the business continuity test under this section if, before the test time, it:
 (a) began to carry on a business it had not previously carried on; or
 (b) in the course of its business operations, entered into a transaction of a kind that it had not previously entered into;
and did so for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of being taken to have carried on throughout the business continuity test period the same business as it carried on immediately before the test time.
Third exception
 (5) So far as the test is applied for the purpose of section  266-115 (Listed widely held trust may be required to work out its net income and tax loss in a special way) and section 268-20 (Widely held unit trust&#39;s income year to be divided into periods), the trust also does not pass the business continuity test under this section if, at any time during the business continuity test period, it incurs expenditure:
 (a) in carrying on a business of a kind that it did not carry on before the test time; or
 (b) as a result of a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations before the test time.
269-105  Modified test for income years starting on or after 1  July 2015
Cases in which businesses need only be similar
 (1) A listed widely held trust also passes the business continuity test during a period (the business continuity test period) in relation to a time (the test time) and in relation to:
 (a) a tax loss for a loss year starting on or after 1  July 2015; or
 (b) net income for an income year starting on or after 1  July 2015; or
 (c) a debt, incurred in an income year starting on or after 1  July 2015, that the trust writes off as bad; or
 (d) a debt, incurred in an income year starting on or after 1  July 2015, in relation to which a debt/equity swap (within the meaning of section 63E) occurs;
if throughout the business continuity test period it carries on a business (its current business) that is similar to the business it carried on immediately before the test time (its former business).
Relevance of being a trust
 (2) The mere fact of being a trust does not mean that the trust cannot carry on a business.
Matters to be considered
 (3) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account in ascertaining whether the trust&#39;s current business is similar to its former business, the following must be taken into account:
 (a) the extent to which the assets (including goodwill) that are used in its current business to generate assessable income throughout the business continuity test period were also used in its former business to generate assessable income;
 (b) the extent to which the activities and operations from which its current business generated assessable income throughout the business continuity test period were also the activities and operations from which its former business generated assessable income;
 (c) the identity of its current business and the identity of its former business;
 (d) the extent to which any changes to its former business result from development or commercialisation of assets, products, processes, services or marketing or organisational methods of the former business.
Exception
 (4) However, the trust does not pass the business continuity test under this section if, before the test time, it:
 (a) began to carry on a business it had not previously carried on; or
 (b) in the course of its business operations, entered into a transaction of a kind that it had not previously entered into;
and did so for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of being taken to have carried on throughout the business continuity test period a business that is similar to the business it carried on immediately before the test time.
Division 270--Schemes to take advantage of deductions
270-5  What this Division is about
A trust may be prevented from making any use of deductions, or full use of deductions in an income year, if a scheme to take advantage of the deductions exists.
270-10  Schemes to take advantage of deductions
Basic case
 (1) The consequences set out in section  270-15 result if:
 (a) a deduction is allowable to a trust for the income year; and
 (b) under a scheme, the following happen (in any order):
 (i) the trust derives an amount of assessable income (the scheme assessable income) in the income year; and
 (ii) an outsider to the trust (see section  270-25) directly or indirectly provides a benefit (see section 270-20) to the trustee, to a beneficiary in the trust or to an associate of the trustee or of a beneficiary; and
Note: The benefit may constitute all or any of the scheme assessable income.
 (iii) the trustee, a beneficiary in the trust or an associate of the trustee or of a beneficiary, directly or indirectly provides a benefit to the outsider to the trust or to an associate of the outsider (other than an associate covered by any of paragraphs 270 -25(1)(a) to (f)); and
Note: The benefit may constitute all or any of the deduction.
 (c) it is reasonable to conclude that:
 (i) the trust derived the scheme assessable income; or
 (ii) the outsider provided the benefit as mentioned in subparagraph  (b)(ii); or
 (iii) the trustee, beneficiary or associate provided the benefit as mentioned in subparagraph  (b)(iii);
  wholly or partly, but not merely incidentally, because the deduction would be allowable; and
 (d) the trust is not an excepted trust under paragraph  272-100(b), (c) or (d).
Special case
 (2) If:
 (a) under a scheme, a person who, before the scheme was entered into, was an outsider to a trust becomes:
 (i) the trustee of the trust; or
 (ii) a person with a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; and
 (b) if the person had not ceased to be an outsider to the trust, the requirements of subsection  (1) would have been satisfied in relation to the scheme;
the requirements of subsection (1) are taken to have been satisfied in relation to the scheme.
270-15  Tax consequences of schemes
  If the requirements of subsection  270-10(1) are satisfied, the consequences are that:
 (a) to the extent (if any) that the deduction mentioned in paragraph  270-10(1)(a) relates exclusively, or may appropriately be related, to the scheme assessable income, the deduction is not allowable; and
 (b) if the net income of the trust is less than the scheme assessable income or there is no net income--the trust has a net income equal to, or the net income is increased so that it equals, the scheme assessable income; and
 (c) paragraph (b) and the scheme assessable income are disregarded in working out any tax loss incurred by the trust in the income year; and
 (d) if paragraph (b) applies and the deduction mentioned in paragraph  270-10(1)(a) is for a tax loss--paragraph (b) and the scheme assessable income are disregarded in working out any deduction in respect of the tax loss allowable after the income year.
270-20  Benefit
  A benefit is:
 (a) money, a dividend or property (whether tangible or intangible); or
 (b) a right or entitlement (whether or not property); or
 (c) services; or
 (d) the extinguishment, forgiveness, release or waiver of a debt or other liability; or
 (e) the doing of anything that results in the derivation of assessable income; or
 (f) anything that, disregarding the preceding paragraphs, is a benefit or advantage.
270-25  Outsider to trust
Outsider to family trust
 (1) If the trust mentioned in paragraph  270-10(1)(a) is a family trust, an outsider to the trust is a person other than:
 (a) the trustee of the trust; or
 (b) a person with a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; or
 (c) the individual specified in the trust&#39;s family trust election; or
 (d) a member of the individual&#39;s family; or
 (da) a trust with the same individual specified in its family trust election; or
 (e) a company, partnership or trust that made an interposed entity election to be included in the individual&#39;s family group, where the election was in force (including before it was made) when the scheme mentioned in paragraph  270-10(1)(b) commenced; or
 (f) a fixed trust, company or partnership (an entity) where, at all times while the scheme mentioned in paragraph 270-10(1)(b) was being carried out:
 (i) the individual specified in the trust&#39;s family trust election; or
 (ii) one or more members of the individual&#39;s family; or
 (iii) the trustees of one or more family trusts, provided the individual is specified in the family trust election of each of those family trusts;
  or any combination of the above, had fixed entitlements, directly or indirectly, and for their own benefit, to all of the income and capital of the entity.
Outsider to non-family trust
 (2) If the trust mentioned in paragraph  270-10(1)(a) is not a family trust, an outsider to the trust is a person other than:
 (a) the trustee of the trust; or
 (b) a person with a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust.

Subdivision 272-A--Fixed entitlement to share of income or capital
272-5  Fixed entitlement to share of income or capital of a trust
 (1) If, under a trust instrument, a beneficiary has a vested and indefeasible interest in a share of income of the trust that the trust derives from time to time, or of the capital of the trust, the beneficiary has a fixed entitlement to that share of the income or capital.
Case where interest not defeasible
 (2) If:
 (a) a person holds units in a unit trust; and
 (b) the units are redeemable or further units are able to be issued; and
 (c) if units in the unit trust are listed for quotation in the official list of an approved stock exchange--the units held by the person will be redeemed, or any further units will be issued, for the price at which other units of the same kind in the unit trust are offered for sale on the approved stock exchange at the time of the redemption or issue; and
 (d) if the units are not listed as mentioned in paragraph  (c)--the units held by the person will be redeemed, or any further units will be issued, for a price determined on the basis of the net asset value, according to Australian accounting principles, of the unit trust at the time of the redemption or issue;
then the mere fact that the units are redeemable, or that the further units are able to be issued, does not mean that the person&#39;s interest, as a unit holder, in the income or capital of the unit trust is defeasible.
Deemed fixed entitlement
 (3) If:
 (a) a beneficiary with an interest in a share of income that the trust derives from time to time, or of the capital of a trust, does not have a fixed entitlement to the share; and
 (b) the Commissioner considers that the beneficiary should be treated as having the fixed entitlement, having regard to:
 (i) the circumstances in which the entitlement is capable of not vesting or the defeasance can happen; and
 (ii) the likelihood of the entitlement not vesting or the defeasance happening; and
 (iii) the nature of the trust;
the beneficiary has the fixed entitlement.

 (1) If a shareholder in a company holds shares carrying the right to receive some or all of the dividends that may be paid by the company, the shareholder has a fixed entitlement to a share of the income of the company equal to the percentage of the total dividends represented by the dividends that the shareholder has a right to receive.
 (2) If a shareholder in a company holds shares carrying the right to receive the whole or part of any distribution of the paid -up share capital of the company in the event of any return of capital to shareholders, the shareholder has a fixed entitlement to a share of the capital of the company equal to the percentage of the total distribution represented by the amount that the shareholder has a right to receive.

Deemed fixed entitlement
 (2) If:
 (a) a partner does not have a fixed entitlement to a share of income that the partnership derives from time to time, or of the capital of a partnership, only because the partner&#39;s share of the income or capital is able to be varied; and
 (b) the Commissioner considers that the partner should be treated as having the fixed entitlement, having regard to:
 (i) the circumstances in which the share is able to be varied; and
 (ii) the likelihood of the variation happening; and
 (iii) the nature of the partnership;
the partner has the fixed entitlement.
272-20  Fixed entitlement to share of income or capital held indirectly
