Part I      Investments

4     Application of Part

         This  Part  applies  to  trusts  created  before   or   after   the
         commencement of the Trustee Amendment Act (No. 2) 1995.

5     Power of trustee to invest

         A  trustee  may,  unless  expressly  forbidden  by  the  instrument
         creating the trust:

         (a)      invest trust funds in any form of investment; and

         (b)      at any time, vary an investment or realise  an  investment
             of  trust  funds  and  reinvest  money  resulting   from   the
             realisation in any form of investment.

6     Duties of trustee in respect of power of investment

      (1)   Subject to the instrument creating the trust, a  trustee  shall,
         in exercising a power of investment:

         (a)      if the trustee's profession, business or employment is  or
             includes acting as a trustee or investing money on  behalf  of
             other persons, exercise the care, diligence and skill  that  a
             prudent  person  engaged  in  that  profession,  business   or
             employment would exercise in managing  the  affairs  of  other
             persons; or

         (b)      if the trustee  is  not  engaged  in  such  a  profession,
             business or employment, exercise the care, diligence and skill
             that a prudent person of business would exercise  in  managing
             the affairs of other persons.

      (2)   A trustee shall, in exercising a  power  of  investment,  comply
         with any provision of the instrument creating  the  trust  that  is
         binding on the trustee and requires the obtaining of a  consent  or
         approval or compliance with any direction  with  respect  to  trust
         investments.

      (3)   Subject to the instrument creating the trust, a  trustee  shall,
         not  less  than  once  in  each  year,   review   the   performance
         (individually and as a whole) of trust investments.

7     Law and equity preserved

      (1)   Any rules and principles of law or equity that impose a duty  on
         a trustee exercising  a  power  of  investment  including,  without
         limiting the generality of those duties, rules and principles  that
         impose:

         (a)      a duty to exercise the powers of a  trustee  in  the  best
             interests of all  present  and  future  beneficiaries  of  the
             trust;

         (b)      a duty to invest trust funds in investments that  are  not
             speculative or hazardous;

         (c)      a  duty  to  act  impartially  towards  beneficiaries  and
             between different classes of beneficiaries; or

         (d)      a duty to take advice,

         continue to apply except so far as they are inconsistent with  this
         or any other Act or the instrument creating the trust.

      (2)   Any rules and principles of law  or  equity  that  relate  to  a
         provision in an  instrument  creating  a  trust  that  purports  to
         exempt, limit the liability of, or indemnify a trustee  in  respect
         of a breach of trust, continue to apply.

      (3)   If a trustee is under a duty  to  take  advice,  the  reasonable
         costs of obtaining the advice are payable out of trust funds.

8     Matters to which trustee shall have regard in exercising power of
         investment

      (1)   Without limiting the  matters  that  a  trustee  may  take  into
         account when exercising a power of investment, a trustee shall,  so
         far as they are appropriate to the circumstances of the trust, have
         regard to:

         (a)      the purposes of the trust and the needs and  circumstances
             of the beneficiaries;

         (b)      the desirability of diversifying trust investments;

         (c)      the nature of and  risk  associated  with  existing  trust
             investments and other trust property;

         (d)      the need to maintain the real  value  of  the  capital  or
             income of the trust;

         (e)      the risk of capital or income loss or depreciation;

         (f)      the potential for capital appreciation;

         (g)      the likely income return and the timing of income return;

         (h)      the length of the term of the proposed investment;

         (j)      the probable duration of the trust;

         (k)      the liquidity and marketability of the proposed investment
             during, and on the determination of, the term of the  proposed
             investment;

         (m)      the aggregate value of the trust estate;

         (n)      the effect of the proposed investment in relation  to  the
             tax liability of the trust;

         (p)      the likelihood of inflation affecting  the  value  of  the
             proposed investment or other trust property;

         (q)      the cost (including commissions, fees, charges and  duties
             payable) of making the proposed investment; and

         (r)      the results of a review of existing trust investments.

      (2)   A trustee may:

         (a)      obtain  and  consider  independent  and  impartial  advice
             reasonably required for the investment of trust funds  or  the
             management of the investment from a person  whom  the  trustee
             reasonably believes to be competent to give the advice; and

         (b)      pay out of trust funds the reasonable costs  of  obtaining
             the advice.

9     Powers of trustee in relation to securities

      (1)   If securities of a body corporate are subject to  a  trust,  the
         trustee may concur in any scheme or arrangement:

         (a)      for or arising out of  the  reconstruction,  reduction  of
             capital or liquidation of, or the issue of shares by, the body
             corporate;

         (b)      for the sale of all  or  any  part  of  the  property  and
             undertaking of the body corporate to another body corporate;

         (c)      for the acquisition of securities of the  body  corporate,
             or  of  control  of  the  body  corporate,  by  another   body
             corporate;

         (d)      for the amalgamation of the body  corporate  with  another

         (e)      for the release,  modification  or  variation  of  rights,
             privileges or liabilities attached to the securities,  or  any
             of them,

         in the same manner as if the trustee were beneficially entitled  to
         the securities.

      (2)   The trustee may accept instead  of,  or  in  exchange  for,  the
         securities subject to the trust securities of any  denomination  or
         description of another  body  corporate  party  to  the  scheme  or
         arrangement.

      (3)    If  a  conditional  or  preferential  right  to  subscribe  for
         securities in a body corporate is offered to a trustee  in  respect
         of a holding in that body corporate or another body corporate,  the
         trustee may, as to all or any of the securities:

         (a)      exercise the right and apply capital money subject to  the
             trust in payment of the consideration;

         (b)      assign to any person, including a  beneficiary  under  the
             trust, the benefit of the right, or the title  to  the  right,
             for the best consideration that can be reasonably obtained; or

         (c)      renounce the right.

      (4)   A trustee accepting or subscribing  for  securities  under  this
         section is, for the purposes of this Part, exercising  a  power  of
         investment.

      (5)   A trustee may  retain  securities  accepted  or  subscribed  for
         under this section for any  period  for  which  the  trustee  could
         properly have retained the original securities.

      (6)   The  consideration  for  an  assignment  made  under  subsection
         (3)(b) shall be held as capital of the trust.

      (7)   This section applies in relation to securities  acquired  before
         or after the commencement of the Trustee Amendment Act (No. 2) 1995
         but subject to the instrument creating the trust.

10    Power of trustee as to calls on shares

         Subject to the instrument creating the trust:

         (a)      a trustee may apply capital money subject to  a  trust  in
             payment of calls on shares subject to the same trust; and

         (b)      if the trustee is a trustee company, it may  exercise  the
             powers conferred by this section notwithstanding the shares on
             which the calls are made being shares in the trustee company.

10A   Power to purchase dwelling house as residence for beneficiary

      (1)   Subject to the instrument creating the trust, a trustee may:

         (a)      purchase a dwelling house for a beneficiary to  use  as  a
             residence; or

         (b)      enter into any other agreement or  arrangement  to  secure
             for a beneficiary a  right  to  use  a  dwelling  house  as  a
             residence.

      (2)   Notwithstanding the terms of the instrument creating the  trust,
         a trustee may, if  to  do  so  would  not  unfairly  prejudice  the
         interests of other beneficiaries,  retain  as  part  of  the  trust
         property a dwelling house for a beneficiary to use as a residence.

      (3)   A dwelling house purchased, retained or  otherwise  secured  for
         use by the beneficiary as a residence may be made available to  the
         beneficiary  for  that  purpose  on  such  terms   and   conditions
         consistent with the trust  and  the  extent  of  the  beneficiary's
         interest as the trustee thinks fit.

      (4)   The trustee may retain a  dwelling  house  or  any  interest  or
         rights in respect of a dwelling house acquired under  this  section
         after the use of the dwelling house by the beneficiary has ceased.

      (5)   In this section, dwelling house includes:

         (a)      any building or part of a building designed, or  converted
             or capable of being converted, for use as a residence; and

         (b)      any amenities or facilities for use  in  association  with
             the use of a dwelling house.

10B   Power of trustee to retain investments

         A trustee is not liable for breach  of  trust  by  reason  only  of
         continuing to hold an investment that has ceased to be:

         (a)      an investment authorised by the  instrument  creating  the
             trust;

         (b)      an investment properly made by the  trustee  exercising  a
             power of investment;

         (c)      an investment made under this Part as previously in  force
             from time to time; or

         (d)      an investment authorised by any other Act or  the  general
             law.

10C   Loans and investments by trustees not breaches of trust in certain
         circumstances

      (1)   If a trustee lends  money  on  the  security  of  property,  the
         trustee is not in breach of trust by reason only of the  amount  of
         the loan in comparison to the value of the  property  at  the  time
         when the loan was made:

         (a)      if it appears to the Court:

             (i) that, in making the loan, the  trustee  was  acting  on  a
                  report as to the value of the property made  by  a  person
                  whom the trustee reasonably believed to  be  competent  to
                  give such a report and whom  the  trustee  instructed  and
                  employed independently of any owner of the property;

             (ii)      that the amount of the  loan  did  not  exceed  two-
                  thirds of the value of  the  property  as  stated  in  the
                  report; and

             (iii)     that the loan was made in reliance on the report; or

         (b)      if the trustee is insured, by a  body  prescribed  by  the
             Minister by notice in the Gazette that it is carrying  on  the
             business of insurance against  all  loss  that  may  arise  by
             reason of the default of the borrower.

      (2)   If a trustee lends money on the security of leasehold  property,
         the trustee is not in breach of  trust  by  reason  only  that  the
         trustee dispensed, either in whole or in part, with the  production
         or investigation of the lessee's title when making the loan.

      (3)   This section applies to  transfers  of  existing  securities  as
         well as to new securities and to investments made before  or  after
         the commencement of the Trustee Amendment Act (No. 2) 1995.

10D   Limitation of liability of trustee for loss on improper investments

      (1)   If a trustee improperly lends trust money  on  a  security  that
         would have been a proper  investment  if  the  sum  lent  had  been
         smaller than the actual sum lent, the security is to be taken to be
         a proper investment in respect of the smaller sum, and the  trustee
         is only liable to make good the difference between the sum advanced
         and the smaller sum, with interest.

      (2)   This section applies to investments made  before  or  after  the
         commencement of the Trustee Amendment Act (No. 2) 1995.

10E   Court may take into account investment strategy in action for breach
         of trust

         If a trustee has been charged with a breach of trust in respect  of
         a  duty  under  this  Part  relating  to  the  trustee's  power  of
         investment, a Court may,  when  considering  the  question  of  the
         trustee's liability, take into account:

         (a)      the nature and purpose of the trust;

         (b)      whether the trustee had regard to the matters set  out  in
             section 8 so far as is appropriate to the circumstances of the
             trust;

         (c)      the trust  investments  have  been  made  pursuant  to  an
             investment strategy formulated in accordance with the duty  of
             a trustee under this Part; and

         (d)      the extent  the  trustee  acted  on  the  independent  and

      (1)   A Court may, when considering an  action  for  breach  of  trust
         arising out of or in respect of an investment by a trustee where  a
         loss has been or is expected to be sustained by the trust, set  off
         all or part of the loss resulting from that investment against  all
         or part of the gain resulting from any other investment whether  in
         breach of trust or not.

      (2)   The power of set off conferred by subsection (1) is in  addition
         to any other power or entitlement to set off all  or  part  of  any
         loss against any property.

10G   Transitional provision

         Any Act or instrument of a legislative or administrative  character
         (whether or not creating a  trust)  that  empowers  or  requires  a
         person to invest money in the investments authorised by this Act is
         to be read as if it empowered or required  that  person  to  invest
         that money according to the provisions  of  this  Part  as  to  the
         investment of trust funds.

Part II     Various powers and duties of trustees

         AppointmentÂ ofÂ newÂ trustees

11    Power of appointing new trustees

      (1)   Where a trustee, either original  or  substituted,  and  whether
         appointed by a Court or otherwise, is dead or remains  out  of  the
         Territory for more than 12 months, or desires to be discharged from
         all or any of the trusts or powers reposed in or conferred on  him,
         or refuses or is unfit to act therein, or is  incapable  of  acting
         therein, then the person or persons nominated for  the  purpose  of
         appointing new trustees by the instrument  (if  any)  creating  the
         trust, or if there is no such person, or no such  person  able  and
         willing to act,  then  the  surviving  or  continuing  trustees  or
         trustee for the time being, or  the  representatives  of  the  last
         surviving or continuing trustee, may, by writing,  appoint  another
         person or other persons to be a trustee or trustees in the place of
         the trustee dead, remaining out of the Territory,  desiring  to  be
         discharged,  refusing  or  being  unfit  or  being  incapable,   as

             of the trust property  held  on  trusts  distinct  from  those
             relating to any other part or parts of the trust property, or,
             if  only  one  trustee  was  originally  appointed,  then  one
             separate trustee may be so appointed for  the  first-mentioned
             part; and

         (c)      it shall not be obligatory to appoint more  than  one  new
             trustee where only one trustee was originally appointed or  to
             fill up the  original  number  of  trustees  where  more  than
             2Â trustees were originally appointed; but, except  where  only
             one trustee was originally appointed, a trustee shall  not  be
             discharged under this section from his trust unless there will
             be at least 2Â trustees to perform the trust; and

         (d)      any assurance or thing requisite  for  vesting  the  trust
             property, or any part thereof, jointly in the persons who  are

             require, shall be executed or done.

      (3)   Every new trustee so appointed, as well before as after all  the
         trust property becomes by law or by assurance or  otherwise  vested
         in him, shall have the same powers, authorities,  and  discretions,
         and be entitled to the same remuneration (if any),  and,  if  of  a
         continuing nature, and may in all respects act as if  he  had  been
         originally appointed a trustee by the instrument (if any)  creating
         the trust.

      (4)   The provisions of this section relative  to  a  trustee  who  is
         dead include the case of a person nominated trustee in a will,  but
         dying before the testator,  and  those  relative  to  a  continuing
         trustee include a refusing or retiring trustee, if willing  to  act
         in the execution of the provisions of this section.

      (5)   This section applies only if and as far as a contrary  intention
         is not expressed in the instrument (if any) creating the trust, and

         declares that he is desirous of being discharged  from  the  trust,
         and if his co-trustees  and  such  other  person  (if  any)  as  is
         empowered to appoint trustees, by deed consent to the discharge  of
         the trustee, and to the vesting in the  co-trustees  alone  of  the
         trust property, then the trustee desirous of being discharged shall
         be deemed to have retired from the trust, and shall, by  the  deed,
         be discharged therefrom under this Act,  without  any  new  trustee
         being appointed in his place.

         any estate or interest in any land, subject to the trust, or in any
         chattel so subject, or the right to recover and receive any debt or
         other thing in action so subject,  shall  vest  in  the  person  or
         persons who, by virtue of the deed, become and are the  trustee  or
         trustees for performing the trust, that declaration shall,  without
         any conveyance or assignment, operate to vest  in  that  person  or

         purposes of the trust, that estate, interest, or right.

      (2)   Where a deed under section 12, by which a  retiring  trustee  is
         discharged under this Act, contains such a  declaration  as  is  in
         this section mentioned by the retiring and continuing trustees  and
         by the other person (if any) empowered to  appoint  trustees,  that
         declaration shall, without any conveyance or assignment, operate to

         Registry Office the person or persons making the declaration  shall

         this Act.

         selling all or any part of the property, either  subject  to  prior
         charges or not, and either together or in lots, by  public  auction

         upon the ground that any of the conditions  subject  to  which  the
         sale was made may have been unnecessarily depreciatory,  unless  it
         also appears that  the  consideration  for  the  sale  was  thereby
         rendered inadequate.

      (2)   No sale made by a trustee shall,  after  the  execution  of  the
         conveyance, be impeached as against the purchaser upon  the  ground
         that any of the conditions subject to which the sale was  made  may
         have been unnecessarily depreciatory, unless it  appears  that  the
         purchaser was acting in collusion with the trustee at the time when
         the contract for sale was made.

      (3)   No purchaser, upon any sale made  by  a  trustee,  shall  be  at

         receive  and  give  a  discharge  for   any   money   or   valuable
         consideration or property  receivable  by  the  trustee  under  the
         trust, by permitting the legal practitioner to have the custody of,
         and to produce, a deed having  in  the  body  thereof  or  endorsed
         thereon a receipt for such money, consideration, or  property,  the
         deed being executed or the endorsed receipt signed by the trustee.

      (2)   A trustee shall not  be  chargeable  with  breach  of  trust  by
         reason only of his having made or  concurred  in  making  any  such
         appointment.   The  producing  of  any  such  deed  by  the   legal
         practitioner shall be sufficient authority to the person liable  to
         pay or give the consideration, or transfer or deliver the property,
         for his paying, giving, transferring, or delivering the same to the
         legal practitioner, without the legal  practitioner  producing  any
         separate or other direction or authority from the trustee.

         trust by reason only of his having made or concurred in making  any
         such appointment.

      (4)   Nothing  in  this  section  shall  exempt  a  trustee  from  any
         liability which he would have incurred if this  Act  had  not  been
         passed, in case he permits any such money, valuable  consideration,
         or property to remain in the hands or under the control of the bank
         or legal practitioner  for  a  period  longer  than  is  reasonably
         necessary to enable the bank or legal practitioner (as the case may
         be) to pay or transfer the same to the trustee.

       (5)    This  section  applies  only  where  the  money  or   valuable
         consideration or property is received  after  the  commencement  of
         this Act.

         otherwise, of a trustee, or of  a  beneficiary  interest  in  trust
         property, authorize the expenditure by  the  trustee,  out  of  the
         capital or income of the trust property  or  of  the  estate  of  a
         deceased person, of  such  sum  as  the  Court  may  think  fit  in
         repairing, reinstating, or improving the trust property or  estate,
         and may by the same or any subsequent order authorize  the  trustee
         to raise moneys required for the purpose  of  such  expenditure  by
         mortgage of the trust property or estate concerned, or of any other
         property or estate subject to the same trusts.

         forbidden to do, or to omit to do anything which he is  in  express
         terms directed to do, by the instrument creating the trust.

18A   Power to insure building or other property

      (1)   A trustee may insure a  building  or  other  insurable  property
         against loss or damage, by fire or otherwise, and against any  risk

         against if acting for himself or herself.

      (2)   The amount that a property is insured for must  not  exceed  the
         full value of the property but that value is  not  limited  to  the
         sale value and may include the replacement  cost  at  the  material
         time as well as indemnity against loss of rent and other collateral
         risks.

      (3)   A trustee may pay the premiums for  the  insurance  out  of  any
         income from the property insured or out of the income of any  other
         property subject to the same trusts, without obtaining the  consent
         of any person, despite that there may be a person  entitled  wholly
         or partly to that income.

19    Power of trustees of renewable leaseholds to renew and raise money
         for the purpose

      (1)   A trustee of  any  leaseholds  for  lives  or  years  which  are
         renewable from time to time, either under any covenant or contract,
         or by custom or usual practice, may, if he thinks fit,  and  shall,
         if thereto required by any person having any  beneficial  interest,
         present or future or contingent, in the leaseholds,  use  his  best
         endeavors to obtain from time to time a renewed lease of  the  same
         hereditaments on the accustomed and reasonable terms, and for  that
         purpose may from time to time make or concur in making a  surrender
         of the lease for the time being subsisting, and do all  such  other
         acts as are requisite:

         Provided that, where by the terms of the settlement  or  will,  the
         person in possession for his life  or  other  limited  interest  is
         entitled to enjoy the same without any obligation to  renew  or  to
         contribute to the expense of renewal, this section shall not apply,
         unless the consent in writing of that person  is  obtained  to  the
         renewal on the part of the trustee.

      (2)   If money is  required  to  pay  for  the  renewal,  the  trustee
         effecting the renewal may pay the same out of any money then in his
         hands in trust for the persons beneficially interested in the lands
         to be comprised in the renewed lease, and if  he  has  not  in  his
         hands sufficient money for the purpose,  he  may  raise  the  money
         required by mortgage of the hereditaments to be  comprised  in  the
         renewed lease, or of any other hereditaments  for  the  time  being
         subject to the uses or trusts  to  which  those  hereditaments  are
         subject; and no person advancing money upon a  mortgage  purporting
         to be under this power shall be bound to  see  that  the  money  is
         wanted, or that no more is raised than is wanted for the purpose.

      (3)   This section applies to trusts created either  before  or  after
         the commencement of this Act; but nothing  in  this  section  shall
         authorize any trustee to do anything which he is in  express  terms
         forbidden to do, or to omit to do anything which he is  in  express
         terms directed to do, by the instrument creating the trust.

         securities,  or  other  personal  property  or   effects   payable,
         transferable, or deliverable to him under any trust or power  shall
         be a sufficient discharge  for  the  same,  and  shall  effectually
         exonerate the person paying, transferring, or delivering  the  same
         from seeing to the application or being answerable for any loss  or
         misapplication thereof.

      (2)   This section applies to trusts created either  before  or  after
         the commencement of this Act.

         trustee is authorized to execute the  trusts  and  powers  thereof,
         may, if and as he or they may think fit, accept any composition  or
         any security, real or personal, for any debt or for  any  property,
         real or personal, claimed, and may allow any time  for  payment  of
         any  debt,  and  may  compromise,  compound,  abandon,  submit   to
         arbitration, or otherwise settle any debt, account, claim, or thing
         whatever relating to the trust, and for any of those  purposes  may
         enter into, give, execute, and do such agreements,  instruments  of
         composition or arrangement, releases, and other things, as  to  him
         or them seem expedient, without  being  responsible  for  any  loss
         occasioned by any act or thing so done  by  him  or  them  in  good
         faith.

      (3)   This section applies only if and as far as a contrary  intention

         time apply to the  Supreme  Court  for  a  declaration  as  to  the
         validity, in respect of  the  rule  against  perpetuities,  of  the
         disposition.

      (2)   The Supreme Court may, on an application under  subsection  (1),
         make a declaration, having regard to facts existing and events that
         have occurred at the time  the  declaration  is  made,  as  to  the
         validity or otherwise of the disposition in respect  of  which  the
         application is made.

       (3)    The  Supreme  Court  shall  not  make  a   declaration   under
         subsectionÂ (2) in respect of a disposition the  validity  of  which
         cannot be determined at the time the Court is  asked  to  make  the
         declaration.

             dead;

         (d)      whether, before the determination of the perpetuity period
             applicable to the disposition, an interest is to be treated as
             incapable of vesting during the period; and/or

         (e)      any other matter on which an application could properly be
             made to the Court apart from under this Act.

22    Distribution of estate after notice by trustee

      (1)   Where a trustee has given notices such as would have been  given
         by  the  Court   in   an   administration   suit   for   creditors,
         beneficiaries, and others to send in to the  trustee  their  claims
         against the trust property, the trustee may, at the  expiration  of
         the time named in the notices, distribute the trust property or any
         part thereof amongst the persons entitled  thereto,  having  regard
         only to the claims of which he then has notice, and  shall  not  be
         liable for the property or any part thereof so distributed  to  any
         person of whose  claim  he  had  no  notice  at  the  time  of  the
         distribution.

      (2)   Where a trustee has received a claim or notice of claim  against
         a trust property, and he disputes the same, such trustee  may  give
         to the person making such claim, or giving such notice, a notice in
         writing that such claim is disputed, and  requiring  such  claimant
         either to withdraw  such  claim  or  to  institute  proceedings  to
         enforce such claim within 6 months of the  service  of  such  last-
         mentioned notice;  and  if  such  claim  is  not  so  withdrawn  or
         prosecuted, the trustee may apply by summons  in  Chambers  to  any
         Judge of the Supreme Court, on affidavit setting out the facts  for
         an order that,  as  against  such  trustee,  such  claim  shall  be
         absolutely barred, and any such Judge may make  such  order  as  he
         shall deem just, and the  same  shall  bind  all  persons  whom  it
         purports to affect.

      (3)   Nothing in this section shall prejudice the right of any  person
         to follow the property or any part thereof into the  hands  of  any
         person who has received the same.

      (4)   A trustee desirous of giving notices under this section may,  on
         application, exÂ parte or otherwise, obtain  the  direction  of  the
         Supreme Court, or of an Associate Judge thereof, as to what notices
         are proper to be given, and as to the mode of service.

23    Powers of 2 or more trustees

      (1)   Where a power or trust is given  to  or  vested  in  2  or  more
         trustees jointly, then, unless the contrary  is  expressed  in  the
         instrument (if any) creating the power or trust, the  same  may  be
         exercised or performed by the survivor or survivors of them for the
         time being.

      (2)   This  section  applies  only  to  trusts  constituted  after  or
         created by instruments coming into operation after the commencement
         of this Act.

24    Powers of maintenance in case of infants

      (1)   Where any property is held by trustees in trust for  an  infant,
         either for life or for any greater interest, and whether absolutely
         or contingently on his attaining the age of 21  years,  or  on  the
         occurrence of any event before his attaining that age, the trustees
         may, at their sole  discretion,  pay  to  the  infant's  parent  or
         guardian (if any) or otherwise apply for or  towards  the  infant's
         maintenance, education, or benefit, the income of that property, or
         any part thereof, whether  there  is  or  is  not  any  other  fund
         applicable to the same purpose, or  any  person  bound  by  law  to
         provide for the infant's maintenance.

      (2)   The trustees shall accumulate all the residue of that income  in
         the way of  compound  interest  by  investing  the  same,  and  the
         resulting income thereof, from time to time on securities in  which
         they are by the instrument of trust (if any), or by law, authorized
         to invest trust money, and shall hold those accumulations  for  the
         benefit of the  person  who  ultimately  becomes  entitled  to  the
         property from which the same arose, but so that the trustees may at
         any time, if they think fit, apply those accumulations, or any part
         thereof, as if the same were income arising  in  the  then  current
         year.

      (3)   This section applies only if and as far as a contrary  intention
         is not expressed in the instrument under which the interest of  the
         infant arises, and shall have effect subject to the terms  of  that
         instrument and to the provisions therein contained.

      (4)   This section applies whether the instrument of trust comes  into
         operation before or after the commencement of this Act.

24A   Power to apply capital towards advancement and benefit

      (1)   Where, under a trust, a person is entitled  to  the  capital  of
         the trust property or any share thereof, the trustee may, from time
         to time out of that capital, pay  or  apply  for  the  maintenance,
         education, advancement or benefit of that person in such manner  as
         the trustee shall in his absolute discretion think  fit  an  amount
         not exceeding in all $2,000 or half the capital, whichever  is  the
         greater, or, with the consent of the Court, an amount greater  than
         that amount.

      (2)   This section applies only where, and in so far  as,  a  contrary
         intent is not expressed in the instrument, if any, under which  the
         interest of the person entitled to the capital or any share of  the
         trust property arises, and shall have effect subject to  the  terms
         of that instrument.

      (3)   This section applies only where the trust property  consists  of
         money or securities or property held upon trust for  sale,  calling
         in and conversion, and the money or securities or the  proceeds  of
         the sale, calling in and conversion are not by statute or in equity
         considered as land.

      (4)   The power conferred by this section may be exercised  whether  a
         person is entitled absolutely or contingently on his attaining  any
         specified age or on the happening of  any  event,  or  whether  his
         interest is subject to a gift over on his death under any specified
         age or on the happening of any  other  event,  and  notwithstanding
         that the interest of  the  person  so  entitled  is  liable  to  be
         defeated by the exercise of a power of appointment  or  revocation,
         or to be diminished by the  increase  of  the  class  to  which  he
         belongs or whether the person  is  entitled  in  possession  or  in
         remainder or reversion.

      (5)   If a person is or becomes absolutely and  indefeasibly  entitled
         to a share in the trust  property,  money  paid  or  applied  under
         subsectionÂ (1) shall be brought into account as part of that share.

      (6)   No  action  shall  be  taken  under  subsection  (1)  so  as  to
         prejudice a person entitled to any prior life  or  other  interest,
         whether vested or contingent, in the money paid or applied,  unless
         such person is in existence, is under no disability and consents in
         writing to the action.

25    Exoneration of trustees in respect of certain powers of attorney

         A trustee acting or  paying  money  in  good  faith,  under  or  in
         pursuance of any power of attorney, shall not  be  liable  for  any
         such act or payment by reason of the fact that at the time  of  the
         payment or act the person who gave the power of attorney  was  dead
         or had done some act to avoid the power, if this fact was not known
         to the trustee at the time of his so acting  or  paying:   Provided
         that nothing in this section shall affect the right of  any  person
         entitled to the money against the person to  whom  the  payment  is
         made, and that the person so entitled shall have  the  same  remedy
         against the person to whom the payment is made as he would have had
         against the trustee.

26    Implied indemnity of trustees

         A trustee  shall,  without  prejudice  to  the  provisions  of  the
         instrument (if any) creating the  trust,  be  chargeable  only  for
         money, stocks, funds, and  securities  actually  received  by  him,
         notwithstanding his signing any receipt for the sake of conformity,
         and shall be answerable and accountable  only  for  his  own  acts,
         receipts, neglects, or defaults, and not for  those  of  any  other
         trustee, nor for any banker, broker, or other person with whom  any
         trust  moneys  or  securities  may  be  deposited,  nor   for   the
         insufficiency or deficiency of any stocks, funds or securities  nor
         for any other loss, unless the same happens through his own  wilful
         default, and may reimburse himself; or pay or discharge out of  the
         trust premises, all expenses incurred in or about the execution  of
         his trusts or powers.

Part III    Powers of the Court

         AppointmentÂ ofÂ newÂ trusteesÂ andÂ vestingÂ orders

27    Power of the Court to appoint new trustees

      (1)   The Supreme Court may, whenever it is  expedient  to  appoint  a
         new  trustee  or  new  trustees,  and  it  is  found   inexpedient,
         difficult, or impracticable so to do without the assistance of  the
         Court, make an order for the appointment of a new  trustee  or  new
         trustees, either in substitution for or in addition to any existing
         trustee  or  trustees,  or  although  there  is  no  trustee.    In
         particular,  and  without  prejudice  to  the  generality  of   the
         foregoing  provision,  the  Court  may  make  an  order   for   the
         appointment of a new trustee in substitution for a trustee  who  is
         found guilty of an indictable  offence,  or  has  been  adjudicated
         insolvent or made an assignment or composition or arrangement  with
         his creditors under any Act in force in that behalf, and may remove
         such last-mentioned trustee.

      (2)   An order under  this  section,  and  any  consequential  vesting
         order or conveyance shall not operate further  or  otherwise  as  a
         discharge to any former or continuing trustee than  an  appointment
         of new trustees under any power for that purpose contained  in  any
         instrument would have operated.

      (3)   Nothing in this section shall give power to appoint an  executor
         or administrator.

28    Vesting order as to land

         In any of the following cases, namely:

         I  Where the Supreme Court appoints or has appointed a new trustee;

         II Where a trustee  entitled  to  or  possessed  of  any  land,  or
             entitled to a  contingent  right  therein,  either  solely  or
             jointly with any other person:

             (a) is a lunatic or person of unsound mind; or

             (b) is an infant; or

             (c) is out of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court; or

             (d) cannot be found;

         III      Where it is uncertain who was the survivor of  2  or  more
             trustees jointly entitled to  or  possessed  of  any  land  or
             entitled to a contingent right therein;

         IV Where as to the last trustee known to have been entitled  to  or
             possessed of any land,  or  entitled  to  a  contingent  right
             therein, it is uncertain whether he is living or dead;

         V  Where there is no heir or representative to a  trustee  who  was
             entitled to or possessed of land or entitled to  a  contingent
             right therein and has died intestate as to that land, or where
             it is uncertain who is the heir or representative  or  devisee
             of a trustee who was entitled  to  or  possessed  of  land  or
             entitled to a contingent right therein and is dead; and

         VI Where a trustee jointly or solely entitled to  or  possessed  of
             any land, or entitled to a contingent right therein, has  been
             required, by or on behalf of a person entitled  to  require  a
             conveyance of the land or a release of the  right,  to  convey
             the land or to release the right, and has wilfully refused  or
             neglected to convey the land or release the right for 28  days
             after the date of the requirement,

         the Supreme Court may make an order (in this Act called  a  vesting
         order) vesting the land in any such person in any such  manner  and
         for any such estate as  the  Court  may  direct,  or  releasing  or
         disposing of the contingent right to such person, as the Court  may
         direct:  Provided that:

         (a)      where the order is consequential on the appointment  of  a
             new trustee the land shall be vested for such  estate  as  the
             Court may direct in the persons who on the appointment are the
             trustees; and

         (b)      where the order relates to a trustee entitled jointly with
             another person, and such trustee is out of the jurisdiction of
             the Supreme Court or cannot be found, the land or right  shall
             be vested in such other person,  either  alone  or  with  some
             other person.

29    Contingent rights of unborn trustees

         Where any land is subject to a contingent right in an unborn person
         or class of unborn persons who, on coming into existence, would, in
         respect thereof, become entitled to or possessed of the land on any
         trust, the Supreme Court may make an order releasing the land  from
         the contingent right, or may make an order vesting  in  any  person
         the estate to or of which the unborn  person  or  class  of  unborn
         persons would, on coming into existence, be entitled  or  possessed
         in the land.

30    Vesting order in place of conveyance by infant mortgagee

         Where any person entitled to or possessed of land or entitled to  a
         contingent right in land, either solely or jointly with  any  other
         person, by way of security for money, is a lunatic, or a person  of
         unsound mind, or an infant, the Supreme Court  may  make  an  order
         vesting or releasing or disposing of the  land  or  right  in  like
         manner as in the case of a trustee who is a lunatic,  a  person  of
         unsound mind, or an infant.

31    Vesting order in place of conveyance by heir or devisee of mortgagee

         Where a mortgagee of land has died without having entered into  the
         possession or into the receipt of the rents  and  profits  thereof,
         and the money due in respect of the mortgage has  been  paid  to  a
         person entitled to receive the same, or that last-mentioned  person
         consents to an order for the re-conveyance of the  land,  then  the
         Supreme Court may make an order vesting the land in such person  or
         persons in such manner and for such estate as the Court may  direct
         in any of the following cases, namely:

         (a)       where  an  heir  or  representative  or  devisee  of  the
             mortgagee is out of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court,  or
             cannot be found;

         (b)       where  an  heir  or  representative  or  devisee  of  the
             mortgagee, on demand made by or on behalf of a person entitled
             to require a conveyance of the land,  has  stated  in  writing
             that he will not convey the same, or does not convey the  same
             for 28 days next after a proper instrument conveying the  land
             has been tendered to him by or on  behalf  of  the  person  so
             entitled;

         (c)      where it is uncertain which of  several  devisees  of  the
             mortgagee was the survivor;

         (d)      where it is  uncertain  as  to  the  survivor  of  several
             devisees of the mortgagee, or as to the heir or representative
             of the mortgagee, whether he is living or dead; and

         (e)      where there is no heir or representative  to  a  mortgagee
             who has died intestate as to the land, or where the  mortgagee
             has died and it is uncertain who is his heir or representative
             or devisee.

32    Vesting order consequential on judgment for sale or mortgage of land

         Where any Court gives a judgment, or makes an order  directing  the
         sale or mortgage of land, every person, whether under disability or
         not, who is entitled to or possessed of the land, or entitled to  a
         contingent  right  therein,  and  is  a  party  to  the  action  or
         proceeding, or otherwise bound by the judgment or order,  shall  be
         deemed to be so entitled or possessed, as the case  may  be,  as  a
         trustee within the meaning of this Act; and the Supreme Court  may,
         if it thinks expedient, make an order vesting the land, or any part
         thereof, for such estate as that Court thinks fit in the  purchaser
         or mortgagee, or in any other person.

33    In what cases the heir, representative, or devisee of a person, who
         has contracted to sell land, shall be deemed a trustee within this
         Act

         Where a person having contracted  in  writing  to  sell  land  dies
         without having conveyed the land in pursuance of his contract,  and
         the consideration for the sale has been paid or  satisfied  in  his
         lifetime, or after his decease, or the person entitled  to  receive
         the  consideration  money  or  such  part  thereof  as  may  remain
         unsatisfied, is willing to  receive  the  same,  and  there  is  no
         dispute or question as to the making of the contract, or as to  the
         right of the purchaser of the land so agreed to be sold  to  demand
         specific performance of such  contract,  and  the  Court  shall  be
         satisfied that the  only  impediment  to  the  performance  thereof
         arises from the fact that the legal estate in the land  has  become
         vested in an heir,  representative,  or  devisee  of  the  deceased
         vendor, who is an infant, or  lunatic,  or  of  unsound  mind,  the
         Supreme Court may make an order declaring the heir, representative,
         or devisee, as the case may be, of the  deceased  vendor  to  be  a
         trustee  of  the  land  contracted  to  be  sold,  and  such  heir,
         representative, or devisee  shall  thereupon  be  deemed  to  be  a
         trustee thereof within the meaning of this Act,  and  at  the  same
         time or subsequently the said Court may order that the  land  shall
         vest in such person in such manner and for such estate as the  said
         Court may direct, and may give directions as  to  the  payment  and
         satisfaction of any unpaid or unsatisfied purchase-money.

34    Vesting order consequential on judgment for specific performance, &c.

         Where a judgment  is  given  for  the  specific  performance  of  a
         contract concerning any land, or for the partition or sale in  lieu
         of partition, or exchange of  any  land,  or  generally  where  any
         judgment is given for the conveyance of any land, either  in  cases
         arising out of the doctrine of election or otherwise,  the  Supreme
         Court may declare that  any  of  the  parties  to  the  action  are
         trustees of the land, or any part thereof, within  the  meaning  of
         this Act, or may declare that the interests of unborn  persons  who
         might claim under any party to the action, or  under  the  will  or
         voluntary settlement of any person  deceased  who  was  during  his
         lifetime a party to the contract or transactions  concerning  which
         the judgment is given, are the interests of persons who, on  coming
         into existence, would be trustees within the meaning of  this  Act;
         and thereupon the Supreme Court may make a vesting  order  relating
         to the rights of those persons, born and unborn,  as  if  they  had
         been trustees.

35    Effects of vesting order

         A vesting order under any of the foregoing provisions shall, in the
         case of a vesting order consequential on the appointment of  a  new
         trustee, have the same effect as if  the  persons  who  before  the
         appointment were the trustees (if any) had duly executed all proper
         conveyances of the land for such estate as the Court directs, or if
         there is no such person, or no such person of full  capacity,  then
         as if such person had existed and been of  full  capacity  and  had
         duly executed all proper conveyances of the land for such estate as
         the Court directs, and shall in every  other  case  have  the  same
         effect as if the trustee, or other person, or description, or class
         of persons to whose rights or supposed rights the  said  provisions
         respectively relate, had been an ascertained and existing person of
         full capacity, and had executed a  conveyance  or  release  to  the
         effect intended by the order.

36    Power to appoint person to convey

         In all cases where a vesting order can be made  under  any  of  the
         foregoing  provisions  the  Supreme  Court  may,  if  it  is   more
         convenient, appoint a person to convey  the  land  or  release  the
         contingent right, and a conveyance or release  by  that  person  in
         conformity with the order shall have the same effect  as  an  order
         under the appropriate provision.

37    Vesting orders as to stock and choses in action

      (1)   In any of the following cases, namely:

         I  Where the Supreme Court appoints or has appointed a new trustee;
             and

         II Where a trustee entitled alone or jointly with another person to
             stock or to a chose in action:

             (a) is a lunatic, a person of unsound mind, or an infant; or

             (b) is out of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court; or

             (c) cannot be found; or

             (d) neglects or refuses  to  transfer  stock  or  receive  the
                  dividends or income thereof, or to sue for  or  recover  a
                  chose in action, according to the direction of the  person
                  absolutely entitled thereto, for  28  days  next  after  a
                  request in writing has been made to him by the  person  so
                  entitled; or

             (e) neglects or refuses to  transfer  stock,  or  receive  the
                  dividends or income thereof, or to sue for  or  recover  a
                  chose in action for 28 days next after  an  order  of  the
                  Supreme Court for that purpose has been served on him; or

         III      Where it is uncertain whether a trustee entitled, alone or
             jointly with another person, to stock or to a chose in  action
             is alive or dead,

         the Supreme Court may make an order vesting the right  to  transfer
         or call for a transfer of stock or  to  receive  the  dividends  or
         income thereof, or to sue for or recover a chose in action  in  any
         such person as the Court may appoint:  Provided that:

         (a)      where the order is consequential on the appointment by the
             Court of a new trustee, the  right  shall  be  vested  in  the
             persons who, on the appointment, are the trustees; and

         (b)      where the person whose right is dealt with  by  the  order
             was entitled jointly with another person, the right  shall  be
             vested in that last-mentioned person, either alone or  jointly
             with any other person whom the Court may appoint.

      (2)   In all cases where a  vesting  order  can  be  made  under  this
         section the Court may, if  it  is  more  convenient,  appoint  some
         proper person to make or join in making the transfer.

      (3)   The person in whom  the  right  to  transfer  or  call  for  the
         transfer of any stock is vested by an order of the Court under this
         Act may transfer the stock to himself or any person,  according  to
         the order; and all companies shall  obey  every  order  under  this
         section according to its tenor.

      (4)   After notice in writing of  an  order  under  this  section,  it
         shall not be lawful for any company to transfer any stock to  which
         the order relates, or to  pay  any  dividends  thereon,  except  in
         accordance with the order.

      (5)   The Supreme Court may  make  declarations  and  give  directions
         concerning the manner in which the right to any stock or  chose  in
         action vested under the provisions of this Act is to be exercised.

      (6)   The provisions of this Act as to vesting orders shall  apply  to
         shares in ships registered under  the  Acts  relating  to  merchant
         shipping as if they were stock.

38    Vesting order as to stock in cases of lunatic or infant mortgagee

         Where a person entitled alone or jointly  with  another  person  to
         stock or a chose in action by  way  of  security  for  money  is  a
         lunatic, or a person of unsound mind, or  an  infant,  the  Supreme
         Court may make an order vesting the right to transfer, or call  for
         a transfer of  the  stock,  or  receive  the  dividends  or  income
         thereof, or to sue for or recover  the  chose  in  action  in  like
         manner as in the case of a trustee who is a lunatic,  a  person  of
         unsound mind, or an infant.

39    Persons entitled to apply for vesting orders

      (1)   An order under this Act for the appointment of  a  new  trustee,
         or concerning any land, stock, or chose  in  action  subject  to  a
         trust, may be made on the application of  any  person  beneficially
         interested in the land, stock, or chose in  action,  whether  under
         disability or not,  or  on  the  application  of  any  person  duly
         appointed trustee thereof.

      (2)   An order under this Act concerning any land, stock, or chose  in
         action subject to a mortgage may be made on the application of  any
         person, whether  under  disability  or  not,  who  is  beneficially
         interested, in equity or otherwise, in the land, stock, or chose in
         action, or of any person interested in the  money  secured  by  the
         mortgage.

40    Powers of new trustees appointed by Court

         Every trustee appointed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall,
         as well before as after the trust property becomes by  law,  or  by
         assurance or otherwise,  vested  in  him,  have  the  same  powers,
         authorities, and discretions, and may in all respects act, as if he
         had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument (if  any)
         creating the trust.

41    Power to charge costs on trust estate

         The Supreme Court may order  the  costs  of  and  incident  to  any
         application for an order appointing a new trustee, or for a vesting
         order, or for an order  releasing  or  disposing  of  a  contingent
         right, or of and incident to any such order, or any  conveyance  or
         transfer in pursuance thereof, to be paid or raised out of the land
         or personal estate in respect whereof the same is made, or  out  of
         the income thereof, or to be borne and paid in such manner  and  by
         such persons as to the Court may seem just.

42    Trustees of charities

         The powers conferred by this  Act  as  to  vesting  orders  may  be
         exercised for vesting any land, stock, or chose in  action  in  any
         trustee of a charity or society over which the Supreme Court  would
         have  jurisdiction  upon  action  duly  instituted,   whether   the
         appointment of the trustee was made by instrument under a power  or
         by the Supreme Court under its general or statutory jurisdiction.

43    Orders made upon certain allegations to be conclusive evidence

         Where a vesting order has been made as to any land under this  Act,
         or under any Act relating to lunacy, founded on  an  allegation  of
         the infancy or personal incapacity of a trustee, representative  or
         mortgagee, or on an allegation  that  a  trustee  or  the  heir  or
         representative or devisee of a mortgagee is out of the jurisdiction
         of the Supreme Court, or cannot be found, or that it  is  uncertain
         which of several  trustees  or  which  of  several  devisees  of  a
         mortgagee was the survivor, or whether the  last  trustee,  or  the
         heir or representative or last surviving devisee of a mortgagee, is
         living or dead, or on an allegation that any trustee  or  mortgagee
         has died intestate without an heir, or has died and it is not known
         who is his heir or representative or devisee,  the  fact  that  the
         order has been so made shall be conclusive  evidence  of  the  fact
         alleged in any Court upon any question as to the  validity  of  the
         order; but this section shall not prevent the  Supreme  Court  from
         directing a reconveyance, or  a  redisposition  of  any  contingent
         right, or the payment of costs occasioned  by  any  such  order  if
         improperly obtained.

         PaymentÂ intoÂ CourtÂ byÂ trusteesÂ andÂ mortgagees

44    Payment into court by trustees and mortgagees

       (1)    Trustees  or  mortgagees,  or  the  majority  of  trustees  or
         mortgagees, having in their hands or under their control  money  or
         securities belonging to a trust, or in respect whereof a trust  has
         arisen by implication or construction of law,  may,  on  filing  an
         affidavit shortly describing the instrument under or in consequence
         of which the trust arises, according to the best of their knowledge
         and belief, or if there be no such instrument, then shortly setting
         out the facts of the case, pay the money  or  securities  into  the
         Supreme Court; and the same shall, subject to rules  of  Court,  be
         dealt with according to the orders of the Supreme Court, which  may
         also order the administration of the  trusts  in  respect  of  such
         money or securities.

      (2)   The receipt or certificate of the  proper  officer  shall  be  a
         sufficient discharge to trustees for the  money  or  securities  so
         paid into Court.

      (3)   Where any moneys or securities are  vested  in  any  persons  as
         trustees or mortgagees, and the majority are desirous of paying the
         same into Court, but the concurrence of the other or others  cannot
         be obtained, the Supreme Court may order the payment into Court  to
         be made by the majority without the concurrence  of  the  other  or
         others; and where any such moneys or securities are deposited  with
         any banker, broker,  or  other  depositary,  the  Court  may  order
         payment or delivery of the moneys or securities to the majority  of
         the trustees for the purpose  of  payment  into  Court,  and  every
         transfer, payment, and delivery made in pursuance of any such order
         shall be valid and take effect as if the same had been made on  the
         authority or by the act of all the persons entitled to  the  moneys
         and securities so transferred, paid, or delivered.

         Miscellaneous

47    Power to give judgment in absence of a trustee

         Where in any action the Supreme Court is  satisfied  that  diligent
         search has been made for  any  person  who,  in  the  character  of
         trustee, is made a defendant in any action, to  serve  him  with  a
         process of the Court, and that he cannot be found,  the  Court  may
         hear and determine the action, and give  judgment  therein  against
         that person in his character of a trustee, as if he had  been  duly
         served, or had entered an appearance in the action,  and  had  also
         appeared by his counsel and solicitor at the hearing,  but  without
         prejudice to any interest he may have in the matters in question in
         the action in any other character.

48    Trustee to have power to sell or convey in certain cases

      (1)   Where a trustee has,  by  the  instrument  creating  the  trust,
         power, subject to the  direction,  request,  or  authority  of  any
         person, to sell, convey, assure, mortgage, or otherwise  deal  with
         property, and such person is dead,  of  unsound  mind,  a  lunatic,
         under disability, or absent from the Territory, the  Supreme  Court
         may authorize the trustee to sell,  convey,  assure,  mortgage,  or
         otherwise deal with the property as if such direction, request,  or
         authority had been given, but the power conferred by  this  section
         shall not be exercised so as to injuriously affect  any  beneficial
         interest of such person.

      (2)   This section applies to trusts created either  before  or  after
         the commencement of this Act.

      (3)   This section shall authorize the Supreme Court  to  confirm  any
         sale, conveyance, assurance, mortgage, or other dealing  heretofore
         made or executed by such trustee in any case in  which  the  Court,
         under this Act, would have authorized the same had it not been made
         or executed.

49    Power to sanction sale of land or minerals separately

      (1)   Where a trustee is for the time being authorized to  dispose  of
         land by way of sale, exchange, or partition, the Supreme Court  may
         sanction his  so  disposing  of  the  land  with  an  exception  or
         reservation of any minerals, and with or without rights and  powers
         of or incidental to the working, getting, or carrying away  of  the
         minerals, or may sanction his so disposing of the minerals, with or
         without the said rights or powers, separately from the  residue  of
         the land.

      (2)   Any such trustee, with the said  sanction  previously  obtained,
         may, unless forbidden by  the  instrument  creating  the  trust  or
         direction, from time to time, without any  further  application  to
         the Court, so dispose of any such land or minerals.

      (3)   Nothing in this section shall derogate from any other  power  of
         a trustee.

49A   Relief from liability for breach of trust

         If it appears to the Supreme Court:

         (a)      that a trustee is, or may  be,  personally  liable  for  a
             breach of trust, whether  the  transaction  alleged  to  be  a
             breach of trust occurs before or  after  the  commencement  of
             this Act; and

         (b)      that the trustee has acted  honestly  and  reasonably  and
             ought fairly to be excused for the breach of  trust,  and  for
             omitting to obtain the directions of the Court in  the  matter
             in which he has committed the breach,

         the Court may relieve the trustee, either wholly  or  partly,  from
         personal liability for the breach of trust.

50    Power to make beneficiary indemnify for breach of trust

      (1)   Where a trustee commits a breach of trust at the instigation  or
         request or with the  consent  in  writing  of  a  beneficiary,  the
         Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, and notwithstanding  that  the
         beneficiary may be a marriedÂ woman entitled for  her  separate  use
         and restrained from anticipation, make such order as to  the  Court
         seems just for impounding all or any part of the  interest  of  the
         beneficiary in the trust estate, by way of indemnity to the trustee
         or any person claiming through him.

      (2)   This section shall apply to breaches of trust committed as  well
         before as after the commencement of this Act, but shall  not  apply
         so as to prejudice any question in an action  or  other  proceeding
         which is pending at the commencement of this Act.

50AA  Cy-pres modification in certain cases

      (1)   Subject to this section, where:

         (a)      the Supreme Court  has,  under  section  21A,  declared  a
             disposition of property to be invalid; or

         (b)      it appears to the Court that a disposition,  whether  made
             before or after the commencement of  this  section,  would  be
             invalid solely on the ground that it conflicts with  the  rule
             against perpetuities,

         and the general intentions originally governing the disposition can
         be ascertained, the Court shall reform the  disposition  so  as  to
         give effect as far as possible to those general  intentions  within
         the  limits  permitted  under  the  rule  against  perpetuities  as
         affected by this section.

      (2)   A disposition of property made before the commencement  of  this
         section shall not be reformed under subsection (1):

         (a)      where the disposition has  been  declared  invalid  before
             that commencement by an order or judgment  made  or  given  in
             legal proceedings;

         (b)      where any  property  comprised  in  the  disposition  has,
             before that commencement, been  paid  or  transferred  to,  or
             applied for the  benefit  of,  or  set  apart  for,  a  person
             entitled by reason of the invalidity of the disposition; or

         (c)       so  as  to  prejudice  a  person  who  has,  before  that
             commencement,  reasonably  altered  his  or  her  position  in
             reliance on the invalidity of the disposition  where,  in  the
             opinion of the Supreme Court, having regard  to  all  possible
             implications in respect of other persons, it is inequitable to
             reform the disposition wholly or in part.

      (3)   In hearing an application to reform  a  disposition  under  this
         section, the Supreme Court:

         (a)      may admit extrinsic evidence  of  the  general  intentions
             originally governing the disposition and shall  apply  liberal
             rules of construction for the purpose  of  ascertaining  them;
             and

         (b)      shall have no regard to the rights of a person other than:

             (i) a person born or en ventre sa mere  when  the  disposition
                  was made; and

             (ii)      a person entitled on the death of a such person,

         and  in  reforming  the  disposition  the  Court  may  specify  the
         perpetuity period in accordance with section  187  of  the  Law  of
         Property Act 2000.

      (4)   An application for reformation under this section  may  be  made
         by:

         (a)      a trustee of property comprised in the disposition;

         (b)      the settlor or the settlor's personal representative; or

         (c)      a person having an interest, whether vested or contingent,
             under the disposition or the personal  representative  of  the
             person to whom the interest passes.

      (5)   Where a trustee of property comprised in a  disposition  becomes
         aware  that  the  disposition  requires  to   be   reformed   under
         subsectionÂ (1), the trustee has a duty to make an application under
         this section.

      (6)   A disposition that has been reformed under this section:

         (a)      is valid notwithstanding that it would have  been  invalid
             under a rule of law or construction if it had been effected in
             any other way; and

         (b)      shall be construed as if it had not  been  effected  under
             this section.

50B   Vesting orders arising from resulting trusts

      (1)   Where the Supreme Court has  refused  to  reform  a  disposition
         under section 50A, it may, if satisfied that the  person  who  made
         the disposition, or his or her personal representative, has  become
         entitled under  a  resulting  trust,  make  an  order  vesting  the
         property comprised in the disposition absolutely in the person  or,
         if the person has died, in his or her  personal  representative  on
         the trusts of the estate of the deceased person.

      (2)   In the case of a disposition  referred  to  in  subsection  (1),
         where a person other than a donor of property given to the  trustee
         on trust, has sold other property to the trustee, or  has  assisted
         the trustee, by loan, guarantee  or  otherwise,  to  acquire  other
         property:

         (a)      the power of the Supreme Court to  make  a  vesting  order
             under that subsection is restricted to so much of the property
             comprised in the disposition as was  given  by  the  donor  or
             fairly attributable to the donor's gift; and

         (b)      the Court may make such order as it thinks  fit  regarding
             the remainder of property comprised in the disposition.

      (3)   An application  for  a  vesting  order  under  this  section  in
         respect of property comprised in a disposition may be made by:

         (a)      a trustee of the property;

         (b)      a vendor of the property to the trustee  or  the  personal
             representative of such a vendor; or

         (c)      a person who assisted the trustee, by loan,  guarantee  or
             otherwise,  to  acquire  the   property,   or   the   personal
             representative of the person.

50A   Power of Court to authorize dealings with trust property

      (1)   The Court may by order, on  application  by  the  trustee  or  a
         beneficiary,  authorize  a  trustee  either  generally  or   in   a
         particular case:

         (a)      to execute a sale, lease, mortgage, surrender, release  or
             other disposition;

         (b)      to make a purchase, acquisition, or investment; or

         (c)      to undertake expenditure,

         as the Court thinks fit and for which  the  trustee  has  no  power
         under the trust instrument or a law in force in the Territory.

      (2)   The Court may make  an  order  referred  to  in  subsection  (1)
         subject to such terms or conditions as it thinks fit and may direct
         whether and how any expenditure or costs are  to  be  paid  out  of
         capital or income of the trust.

      (3)   The Court may make  an  order  referred  to  subsection  (1)  in
         relation to property despite that the property is the subject of  a
         life interest in the  whole  of  the  property  or  any  estate  or
         interest in the property.

      (4)   An application to the Court for an order  relating  to  property
         referred to in subsection (3) is to be made with the consent of all
         persons having a beneficial  interest  in  the  property,  and  all
         trustees having an estate or interest on behalf of an unborn child.

       (5)    Despite  subsection  (4)  the  Court  may  dispense  with  the
         requirement for consent of a person if that person has been  served
         with a notice that the application will be made, and the person has
         made no response.

      (6)   A person who has been served with a notice that the  application
         will be made may appear in Court  to  consent  or  dissent  to  the
         making of the order sought.

      (7)   The Court may make an order in relation to the property  despite
         dissent by some interested parties.

      (8)   In deciding whether to make an  order  despite  the  dissent  of
         some parties the Court must have regard to the number and interests
         of the parties.

Part IV     Special provisions as to appointment of new trustees

51    This part to be permissive

         This part of this Act is  permissive  only,  and  trustees  may  be
         appointed and trust  estates  may  be  transferred,  conveyed,  and
         assigned as if this part of this Act had not been passed.

52    Application of this part

         This part of this Act shall not apply to trust  estates  held  upon
         any  trust  created  by  an  instrument  expressly  forbidding  the
         application of this part of this Act; but, except  as  provided  by
         this section, this part of  this  Act  shall  apply  to  all  trust
         estates.

53    Interpretation

         In the interpretation of this Part of this Act the following  words
         shall have the following meanings:

         trust estates shall include  real  and  personal  estate  of  every
         description held upon trust.

         appointment of new trustees shall include every appointment of  new
         trustees, and whether such  new  trustees  are  to  act  solely  or
         jointly with any old trustees.

54    Form of appointment of new trustee

         Any appointment of new trustees, if signed by the persons  entitled
         to exercise the power of appointment and by the new  trustees,  and
         attested in manner prescribed by the Land Title Act  2000  for  the
         attestation of instruments, and made in the form or to  the  effect
         contained in the Third Schedule  hereto,  or  as  near  thereto  as
         circumstances will  permit,  shall  be  sufficient  and  valid  and
         effectual to all intents and purposes, so far as regards  the  form
         and mode of execution and attestation thereof.

55    Extension of power of appointing new trustees

         Any power of appointing new trustees vested in any  persons  within
         the Territory, jointly with any persons absent therefrom,  and  who
         shall have been continuously absent therefrom for at least one year
         then  immediately  preceding,  may  be  exercised  by  such  first-
         mentioned persons solely as if such power were  exclusively  vested
         in them, and such power shall extend to authorize  the  appointment
         of new trustees in the places  of  any  trustees  absent  from  the
         Territory,  and  having  been  continuously  absent  therefrom   as
         aforesaid, and such trustees on any appointment of new trustees  in
         their places shall cease to be trustees.

56    Appointment of new trustees may be registered

         On  any  appointment  of  new  trustees,  a  memorandum   of   such
         appointment may be registered by the Registrar-General.

57    Registration to vest estates in new trustees

         On the registration of any memorandum of  the  appointment  of  new
         trustees, such trustees shall be deemed to be duly  appointed,  and
         the trust estates held upon the trusts to which such  new  trustees
         are  appointed  shall,  without  any   conveyance,   transfer,   or
         assignment, vest in the new trustees, either solely or jointly with
         the old trustees, as the case may require, for all the  estate  and
         interest of  the  old  trustees  therein,  subject  to  the  trusts
         affecting such trust estates then subsisting, and capable of taking
         effect.

59    Registration with power of disposition to lesser number of joint
         owners

         Whenever any land is brought or dealt with under the provisions  of
         the Land Title Act 2000, the application  or  instrument  affecting
         the same may require the registration  consequent  thereon,  if  in
         favour of 2 or more persons, to be made with the  addition  of  the
         words "with power of disposition to any" less number of "registered
         proprietors" to be specified in such application or instrument, and
         thereupon the Registrar-General shall include in  the  registration
         the words desired, and thereafter, whilst such  registration  shall
         continue, the number of registered proprietors so specified  whilst
         registered with others as joint owners may deal with and dispose of
         the registered estate or interest as if  they  were  registered  as
         sole proprietors thereof.

60    Form of memorandum of appointment of new trustee

         A memorandum of the appointment of a new trustee  for  registration
         under this Act shall be in the form prescribed under the Land Title
         Act 2000 for the registration of the appointment of a  new  trustee
         and shall satisfy the requirements of that Act in respect  of  that
         form.

63    Preservation of powers of Registrar-General

         Nothing in this part of this Act contained, or thereby  implied  or
         to be done in pursuance thereof, shall be construed to  affect  the
         title of any registered proprietor with notice  of  any  trust,  or
         otherwise to limit the right of any registered proprietor  to  deal
         with the estate or interest of which he  is  registered  proprietor
         for all the purposes of the Land Title Act 2000, as absolute owner,
         or to defeat, limit, or prejudice any power or discretion vested in
         the Registrar-General under the Land Title Act 2000, but  all  such
         powers and discretions may be exercised  by  the  Registrar-General
         with reference to proceedings under this Act; and for  the  purpose
         of such proceedings this part of this  Act  shall  be  incorporated
         with the Land Title Act 2000, and all persons shall be  subject  to
         the provisions thereof.

64    Preservation of liability of trustee

         Nothing in this Part of this Act contained, or thereby  implied  or
         to be done in pursuance thereof, shall release any trustee from any
         liability for any breach of trust.

         commission in the nature of a writ deÂ lunatico inquirendo to  issue

1     Short title and application

         incorporated with "The Trustee Act, 1893," and the 2  Acts  may  be
         cited together as "The Trustee Acts, 1893 and 1907."

         A trustee on the sale of trust property may leave unpaid  purchase-
         money thereof invested upon the security of the  property  sold  to
         the extent to which, were the trustee not the vendor thereof,  such
         property would be a proper security for the investment of the trust
         funds.

Various powers and liabilities

3     Trustee's power of delegation

      (1)   A trustee who, for the time being, is or is about to  be  absent
         from South Australia  may,  if  not  expressly  prohibited  by  the
         instrument creating the trust, with the consent of  his  co-trustee
         (if any), by power of attorney, under seal, delegate,  for  a  term
         not exceeding 12 calendar months from the date  of  such  power  of
         attorney, to any person or persons residing in South Australia, all
         or any of the powers, authorities, and discretions vested  in  such
         trustee.

       (2)    Every  deed,  act,  matter,  and  thing  executed,  done,  and

      (3)   A trustee appointing any  attorney  or  attorneys  as  aforesaid
         shall be liable for the acts and defaults of every such attorney as
         if they were his own acts and defaults.

      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or  affect  any
         power of appointing a new trustee in the place of a trustee  absent
         from South Australia, or the power of the Supreme Court to make any
         order by reason of such absence.

4     Revocation of power of attorney not effectual  as  against  person  in
         ignorance

         No  revocation  of  any  such  power  of  attorney,  including  any

         ignorance of such revocation.

5     Trustees bank account

         writing signed by them, authorize any bank to honor cheques, bills,
         promissory notes, and drafts drawn upon or made payable out of  the
         banking account of the trust by any one or more of such trustees or
         attorneys, and to honor the indorsement of any one or more of  such
         trustees or attorneys upon any cheque, bill,  promissory  note,  or
         draft payable to the order of the trustees, and also to pay to  any
         one or more of such trustees or attorneys, whether before or  after
         maturity, all or any portion  of  any  moneys  deposited  on  fixed
         deposit.

      (2)   Every trustee who, in person or by attorney, gives or  joins  in
         giving any such authority shall be liable for the acts and defaults
         of every trustee or attorney acting thereunder as if they were  his
         own acts and defaults.

      (3)   No revocation of any such authority,  including  any  revocation
         or avoidance by operation of law, shall be effectual as against any
         banker acting or paying money in good faith under or  in  pursuance
         of such authority in ignorance of such revocation.

6     Trustee may sell land with consent of Court

         With  the  consent  of  the  Court,  and  notwithstanding  anything

         purposes to be held in conformity with the said Act,  the  trustees
         in whom the legal estate of such land shall be  vested  shall  have

Powers of the Court

7     Power for Court to authorize purchase of trust property by trustee

         Where there is a trust for sale or power of sale the Supreme  Court
         may, on the application, ex parte or otherwise, of a trustee, or of
         a beneficiary interested in the trust property, or  of  the  Public
         Trustee, or a next friend on behalf of such a beneficiary  not  sui
         juris, upon being satisfied that such sale will be advantageous  to
         the beneficiaries, authorize a sale of trust property by a  trustee
         to himself,  unless  such  sale  be  expressly  prohibited  by  the
         instrument creating the trust.

         and the Public Trustee shall, on the request of a  majority  or  of
         half of the beneficiaries and at their cost, audit the accounts  so
         filed.
