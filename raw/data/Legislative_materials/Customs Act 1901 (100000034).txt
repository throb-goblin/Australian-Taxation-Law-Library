There was one contemporary sale of 4 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $40.
There was one contemporary sale of 7 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $60.
There were 3 contemporary sales of 2 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $60.
This means that:
10 units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $100.
22 units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $40.
13 units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $60.
Result:
More units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $40 than were sold in such sales at any other unit price.

Facts:
There was one contemporary sale of 10 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $60.
There were 2 contemporary sales of 2 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $20.
There was one contemporary sale of 6 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $20.
There were 8 contemporary sales of 1 unit of comparable goods at a unit price of $80.
There was one contemporary sale of 5 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $70.
There were 2 contemporary sales of 2 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $70.
There were 2 contemporary sales of 1 unit of comparable goods at a unit price of $50.
There were 2 contemporary sales of 4 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $50.
Result:
An equal number of units of comparable goods (10) were sold in contemporary sales at 3 unit prices ($60, $20, $50).
This number is not exceeded by 8 units of comparable goods sold in contemporary sales at $80 or by 9 units of comparable goods sold in contemporary sales at $70.
Therefore, reference sales are the sales at the unit price of $20.

 (ii) because the situation in the market of the country of export is such that sales in that market are not suitable for use in determining a price under subsection  (1);
  the normal value of goods exported to Australia cannot be ascertained under subsection  (1); or
 (b) is satisfied, in a case where like goods are not sold in the ordinary course of trade for home consumption in the country of export in sales that are arms length transactions by the exporter, that it is not practicable to obtain, within a reasonable time, information in relation to sales by other sellers of like goods that would be relevant for the purpose of determining a price under subsection  (1);
the normal value of the goods for the purposes of this Part is:
 (c) except where paragraph  (d) applies, the sum of:
 (i) such amount as the Minister determines to be the cost of production or manufacture of the goods in the country of export; and
 (ii) on the assumption that the goods, instead of being exported, had been sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in the country of export--such amounts as the Minister determines would be the administrative, selling and general costs associated with the sale and the profit on that sale; or
 (d) if the Minister directs that this paragraph applies--the price determined by the Minister to be the price paid or payable for like goods sold in the ordinary course of trade in arms length transactions for exportation from the country of export to a third country determined by the Minister to be an appropriate third country, other than any amount determined by the Minister to be a reimbursement of the kind referred to in subsection  269TAA(1A) in respect of any such transactions.
 (3) The price determined under paragraph  (2)(d) is a price that the Minister determines, having regard to the quantity of like goods sold as described in paragraph (2)(d) at that price, is representative of the price paid in such sales.
 (3A) The Minister is not required to consider working out the normal value of goods under paragraph  (2)(d) before working out the normal value of goods under paragraph (2)(c).
 (4) Subject to subsections  (6) and (8), where the Minister is satisfied that it is inappropriate to ascertain the normal value of goods in accordance with the preceding subsections because the Government of the country of export:
 (a) has a monopoly, or substantial monopoly, of the trade of the country; and
 (b) determines or substantially influences the domestic price of goods in that country;
the normal value of the goods for the purposes of this Part is to be a value ascertained in accordance with whichever of the following paragraphs the Minister determines having regard to what is appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances of the case:
 (c) a value equal to the price of like goods produced or manufactured in a country determined by the Minister and sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in that country, being sales that are arms length transactions;
 (d) a value equal to the price determined by the Minister to be the price of like goods produced or manufactured in a country determined by the Minister and sold in the ordinary course of trade in arms length transactions for exportation from that country to a third country determined by the Minister to be an appropriate third country;
 (e) a value equal to the sum of the following amounts ascertained in respect of like goods produced or manufactured in a country determined by the Minister and sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in that country:
 (i) such amount as the Minister determines to be the cost of production or manufacture of the like goods in that country;
 (ii) such amounts as the Minister determines to be the administrative, selling and general costs associated with the sale of like goods in that country and the profit on that sale;
 (f) a value equal to the price payable for like goods produced or manufactured in Australia and sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in Australia, being sales that are arms length transactions.
 (5) The price determined under paragraph  (4)(d) is a price that the Minister determines, because of the quantity of like goods sold as described in paragraph (4)(d) at that price, is representative of the price paid in such sales.
 (5A) Amounts determined:
 (a) to be the cost of production or manufacture of goods under subparagraph  (2)(c)(i) or (4)(e)(i); and
 (b) to be the administrative, selling and general costs in relation to goods under subparagraph  (2)(c)(ii) or (4)(e)(ii);
must be worked out in such manner, and taking account of such factors, as the regulations provide for the respective purposes of paragraphs 269TAAD(4)(a) and (b).
 (5B) The amount determined to be the profit on the sale of goods under subparagraph  (2)(c)(ii) or (4)(e)(ii), must be worked out in such manner, and taking account of such factors, as the regulations provide for that purpose.
 (5C) Without limiting the generality of the matters that may be taken into account by the Minister in determining whether a third country is an appropriate third country for the purposes of paragraph  (2)(d) or (4)(d), the Minister may have regard to the following matters:
 (a) whether the volume of trade from the country of export referred to in paragraph  (2)(d) or the country first-mentioned in paragraph (4)(d) is similar to the volume of trade from the country of export to Australia; and
 (b) whether the nature of the trade in goods concerned between the country of export referred to in paragraph  (2)(d) or the country first-mentioned in paragraph (4)(d) is similar to the nature of trade between the country of export and Australia.
 (5D) The normal value of goods (the exported goods) is the amount determined by the Minister, having regard to all relevant information, if the exported goods are exported to Australia and the Minister is satisfied that the country of export has an economy in transition and that at least one of the following paragraphs applies:
 (a) both of the following conditions exist:
 (i) the exporter of the exported goods sells like goods in the country of export;
 (ii) market conditions do not prevail in that country in respect of the domestic selling price of those like goods;
 (b) both of the following conditions exist:
 (i) the exporter of the exported goods does not sell like goods in the country of export but others do;
 (ii) market conditions do not prevail in that country in respect of the domestic selling price of those like goods;
 (c) the exporter of the exported goods does not answer questions in a questionnaire given to the exporter by the Commissioner under subsection  269TC(8) within the period described in that subsection or subsection 269TC(9) for answering questions;
 (d) the answers given within the period mentioned in subsection  269TC(8), or the further period mentioned in subsection 269TC(9), by the exporter of the exported goods to a questionnaire given to the exporter under subsection  269TC(8) do not provide a reasonable basis for determining that paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection do not apply.
Note: Subsection 269TC(8) deals with the Commissioner giving an exporter of goods to Australia a questionnaire about evidence of whether or not paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this subsection apply, with a specified period of at least 30 days for the exporter to answer the questions. Under subsection  269TC(9) the Commissioner may allow the exporter a further period for answering the questions.
 (5E) To be satisfied that the conditions in paragraph  (5D)(a) or (b) exist, the Minister must have regard to the matters (if any) prescribed by the regulations.
 (5F) Without limiting the generality of subsection  (5D), for the purpose of working out, under that subsection, the amount that is to be the normal value of goods exported to Australia, the Minister may determine that amount in a manner that would be open to the Minister under paragraph  (4)(c), (d), (e) or (f) if subsection (4) were applicable.
 (5J) For the purposes of fulfilling Australia&#39;s international obligations under an international agreement, regulations may be made to disapply subsection  (5D) to a country.
 (6) Where the Minister is satisfied that sufficient information has not been furnished or is not available to enable the normal value of goods to be ascertained under the preceding subsections  (other than subsection (5D)), the normal value of those goods is such amount as is determined by the Minister having regard to all relevant information.
 (7) For the purposes of this section, the Minister may disregard any information that he or she considers to be unreliable.
 (7A) The application of subsection  (5D) to goods that are exported to Australia from a particular country does not preclude the application of other provisions of this section (other than subsections (4) and (5)) to other goods that are exported to Australia from that country.
 (8) Where the normal value of goods exported to Australia is the price paid or payable for like goods and that price and the export price of the goods exported:
 (a) relate to sales occurring at different times; or
 (b) are not in respect of identical goods; or
 (c) are modified in different ways by taxes or the terms or circumstances of the sales to which they relate;
that price paid or payable for like goods is to be taken to be such a price adjusted in accordance with directions by the Minister so that those differences would not affect its comparison with that export price.
 (9) Where the normal value of goods exported to Australia is to be ascertained in accordance with paragraph  (2)(c) or (4)(e), the Minister must make such adjustments, in determining the costs to be determined under that paragraph, as are necessary to ensure that the normal value so ascertained is properly comparable with the export price of those goods.
 (10) Where:
 (a) the actual country of export of goods exported to Australia is not the country of origin of the goods; and
 (b) the Minister is of the opinion that the normal value of the goods should be ascertained for the purposes of this Part as if the country of origin were the country of export;
he or she may direct that the normal value of the goods is to be so ascertained.
 (11) For the purposes of subsection  (10), the country of origin of goods is:
 (a) in the case of unmanufactured raw products--the country of which they are products; or
 (b) in any other case--the country in which the last significant process in the manufacture or production of the goods was performed.
 (14) If:
 (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and
 (b) goods the subject of the application are exported to Australia; but
 (c) the volume of sales of like goods for home consumption in the country of export by the exporter or another seller of like goods is less than 5% of the volume of goods the subject of the application that are exported to Australia by the exporter;
the volume of sales referred to in paragraph (c) is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), to be a low volume unless the Minister is satisfied that it is still large enough to permit a proper comparison for the purposes of assessing a dumping margin under section  269TACB.

 (b) there is a review under Division  5 in relation to the publication of a dumping duty notice;
 (c) there is an inquiry under Division  6A in relation to the continuation of a dumping duty notice;
then:
 (d) if the export price of goods for an uncooperative exporter is to be worked out in relation to the investigation, review or inquiry--that export price is to be worked out under subsection  269TAB(3); and
 (e) if the normal value of goods for an uncooperative exporter is to be worked out in relation to the investigation, review or inquiry--that normal value is to be worked out under subsection  269TAC(6).

 (d) if the normal value of goods for a residual exporter is to be worked out in relation to the investigation, review or inquiry--that normal value must not exceed the weighted average of normal values for like goods of cooperative exporters from the same country of export.
 (3) To the extent that subsection  (2) applies in relation to an investigation, the weighted average of export prices, and the weighted average of normal values, of the cooperative exporters must not include any export price or normal value if, in a comparison under section  269TACB involving that export price or normal value, the Minister has determined:
 (a) that there is no dumping; or
 (b) that the dumping margin, when expressed as a percentage of the export price or weighted average of export prices used to establish that dumping margin, is less than 2%.

Working out whether dumping has occurred and levels of dumping

 (1) If:
 (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and
 (b) export prices in respect of goods the subject of the application exported to Australia during the investigation period have been established in accordance with section  269TAB; and
 (c) corresponding normal values in respect of like goods during that period have been established in accordance with section  269TAC;
the Minister must determine, by comparison of those export prices with those normal values, whether dumping has occurred.
 (2) In order to compare those export prices with those normal values, the Minister may, subject to subsection  (3):
 (a) compare the weighted average of export prices over the whole of the investigation period with the weighted average of corresponding normal values over the whole of that period; or
 (aa) use the method of comparison referred to in paragraph  (a) in respect of parts of the investigation period as if each of these parts were the whole of the investigation period; or
 (b) compare the export prices determined in respect of individual transactions over the whole of the investigation period with the corresponding normal values determined over the whole of that period; or
 (c) use:
 (i) the method of comparison referred to in paragraph  (a) in respect of a part or parts of the investigation period as if the part or each of these parts were the whole of the investigation period; and
 (ii) the method of comparison referred to in paragraph  (b) in respect of another part or other parts of the investigation period as if that other part or each of these other parts were the whole of the investigation period.
 (2A) If paragraph  (2)(aa) or (c) applies:
 (a) each part of the investigation period referred to in the paragraph must not be less than 1 month; and
 (b) the parts of the investigation period as referred to in paragraph  (2)(aa), or as referred to in subparagraphs (2)(c)(i) and (ii), must together comprise the whole of the investigation period.
 (3) If the Minister is satisfied:
 (a) that the export prices differ significantly among different purchasers, regions or periods; and
 (b) that those differences make the methods referred to in subsection  (2) inappropriate for use in respect of a period constituting the whole or a part of the investigation period;
the Minister may, for that period, compare the respective export prices determined in relation to individual transactions during that period with the weighted average of corresponding normal values over that period.
 (4) If, in a comparison under subsection  (2), the Minister is satisfied that the weighted average of export prices over a period is less than the weighted average of corresponding normal values over that period:
 (a) the goods exported to Australia during that period are taken to have been dumped; and
 (b) the dumping margin for the exporter concerned in respect of those goods and that period is the difference between those weighted averages.
 (4A) To avoid doubt, a reference to a period in subsection  (4) includes a reference to a part of the investigation period.
 (5) If, in a comparison under subsection  (2), the Minister is satisfied that an export price in respect of an individual transaction during the investigation period is less than the corresponding normal value:
 (a) the goods exported to Australia in that transaction are taken to have been dumped; and
 (b) the dumping margin for the exporter concerned in respect of those goods and that transaction is the difference between that export price and that normal value.
 (6) If, in a comparison under subsection  (3), the Minister is satisfied that the export prices in respect of particular transactions during the investigation period are less than the weighted average of corresponding normal values during that period:
 (a) the goods exported to Australia in each such transaction are taken to have been dumped; and
 (b) the dumping margin for the exporter concerned in respect of those goods is the difference between each relevant export price and the weighted average of corresponding normal values.
 (10) Any comparison of export prices, or weighted average of export prices, with any corresponding normal values, or weighted average of corresponding normal values, must be worked out in respect of similar units of goods, whether determined by weight, volume or otherwise.

Working out whether a financial contribution or income or price support confers a benefit

 (1) Subject to subsections  (2) and (3), the question whether a financial contribution or income or price support confers a benefit is to be determined by the Minister having regard to all relevant information.
 (2) A direct financial payment received from any of the following is taken to confer a benefit:
 (a) a government of a country;
 (b) a public body of a country;
 (c) a public body of which a government of a country is a member;
 (d) a private body entrusted or directed by a government of a country or by such a public body to carry out a governmental function.
Guidelines for financial contributions
 (3) In determining whether a financial contribution confers a benefit, the Minister must have regard to the following guidelines:
 (a) the provision of equity capital from a government or body referred to in subsection  (2) does not confer a benefit unless the decision to provide the capital is inconsistent with normal investment practice of private investors in the country concerned;
 (b) the making of a loan by a government or body referred to in subsection  (2) does not confer a benefit unless the loan requires the enterprise receiving the loan to repay a lesser amount than would be required for a comparable commercial loan which the enterprise could actually obtain;
 (c) the guarantee of a loan by a government or body referred to in subsection  (2) does not confer a benefit unless the enterprise receiving the guarantee is required to repay on the loan a lesser amount than would be required for a comparable commercial loan without that guarantee;
 (d) the provision of goods or services by a government or body referred to in subsection  (2) does not confer a benefit unless the goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration;
 (e) the purchase of goods or services by a government or body referred to in subsection  (2) does not confer a benefit unless the purchase is made for more than adequate remuneration.
 (4) For the purposes of paragraphs  (3)(d) and (e), the adequacy of remuneration in relation to goods or services is to be determined having regard to prevailing market conditions for like goods or services in the country where those goods or services are provided or purchased.

 (e) the difference between:
 (i) the price that has been or is likely to be paid for goods of that kind, or like goods, produced or manufactured in the Australian industry and sold in Australia; and
 (ii) the price that has been or is likely to be paid for goods of that kind exported to Australia from the country of export and sold in Australia; and
 (f) the effect that the exportation of goods of that kind to Australia from the country of export in those circumstances has had or is likely to have on the price paid for goods of that kind, or like goods, produced or manufactured in the Australian industry and sold in Australia; and
 (g) any effect that the exportation of goods of that kind to Australia from the country of export in those circumstances has had or is likely to have on the relevant economic factors in relation to the Australian industry; and
 (h) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section  269TJ and the goods are agricultural products--whether the exportation of goods of that kind to Australia from the country of export in those circumstances has given or is likely to give rise to a need for financial or other support, or an increase in financial or other support, for the Australian industry from the Commonwealth Government.
 (2) In determining, for the purposes of section  269TH or 269TK, whether material injury to an industry in a third country has been or is being caused or is threatened or would or might have been caused because of any circumstances in relation to the exportation of goods to Australia from the country of export, the Minister may, without limiting the generality of that section but subject to subsections  (2A) to (2C), have regard to:

 (i) the quantity of goods of that kind exported to Australia from the country of export and sold or consumed in Australia; or
 (ii) the quantity of goods of that kind, or like goods, produced or manufactured in the third country and sold or consumed in Australia;
  bears to the quantity of goods of that kind, or like goods, sold or consumed in Australia; and
 (d) the export price that has been or is likely to be paid by importers for goods of that kind exported to Australia from the country of export; and
 (e) the difference between:

 (g) any effect that the exportation of goods of that kind to Australia from the country of export in those circumstances has had or is likely to have on the relevant economic factors in relation to the producer or manufacturer in the third country.
 (2A) In making a determination in relation to the exportation of goods to Australia for the purposes referred to in subsection  (1) or (2), the Minister must consider whether any injury to an industry, or hindrance to the establishment of an industry, is being caused or threatened by a factor other than the exportation of those goods such as:
 (a) the volume and prices of imported like goods that are not dumped; or
 (b) the volume and prices of importations of like goods that are not subsidised; or
 (c) contractions in demand or changes in patterns of consumption; or
 (d) restrictive trade practices of, and competition between, foreign and Australian producers of like goods; or
 (e) developments in technology; or
 (f) the export performance and productivity of the Australian industry;
and any such injury or hindrance must not be attributed to the exportation of those goods.
 (2AA) A determination for the purposes of subsection  (1) or (2) must be based on facts and not merely on allegations, conjecture or remote possibilities.
 (2B) In determining:
 (a) for the purposes of subsection  (1), whether or not material injury is threatened to an Australian industry; or
 (b) for the purposes of subsection  (2), whether or not material injury is threatened to an industry in a third country;
because of the exportation of goods into the Australian market, the Minister must take account only of such changes in circumstances, including changes of a kind determined by the Minister, as would make that injury foreseeable and imminent unless dumping or countervailing measures were imposed.
 (2C) In determining, for the purposes referred to in subsection  (1) or (2), the effect of the exportations of goods to Australia from different countries of export, the Minister should consider the cumulative effect of those exportations only if the Minister is satisfied that:
 (a) each of those exportations is the subject of an investigation; and
 (b) either:
 (i) all the investigations of those exportations resulted from applications under section  269TB lodged with the Commissioner on the same day; or
 (ii) the investigations of those exportations resulted from applications under section  269TB lodged with the Commissioner on different days but the investigation periods for all the investigations of those exportations overlap significantly; and
 (c) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section  269TG or 269TH--the dumping margin worked out under section 269TACB for the exporter for each of the exportations is at least 2% of the export price or weighted average of export prices used to establish that dumping margin; and
 (d) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section  269TG or 269TH--for each application, the volume of goods the subject of the application that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over a reasonable examination period (as defined in subsection  269TDA(17)) from the country of export and dumped is not taken to be negligible for the purposes of subsection 269TDA(3) because of subsection  269TDA(4); and
 (da) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section  269TJ or 269TK:
 (i) the amount of the countervailable subsidy in respect of the goods the subject of each of the exportations exceeds the negligible level of countervailable subsidy worked out under subsection  269TDA(16); and
 (ii) the volume of each of those exportations is not negligible; and
 (e) it is appropriate to consider the cumulative effect of those exportations, having regard to:
 (i) the conditions of competition between those goods; and

Currency conversion

 (1) If, for the purposes of this Part, comparison of the export prices of goods exported to Australia and corresponding normal values of like goods requires a conversion of currencies, that conversion, subject to subsection  (2), is to be made using the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction or agreement that, in the opinion of the Minister, best establishes the material terms of the sale of the exported goods.
 (2) If, in relation to goods exported to Australia, a forward rate of exchange is used, the Minister may, in a conversion of currencies under subsection  (1), make use of that rate of exchange.
 (3) If:
 (a) the comparison referred to in subsection  (1) requires the conversion of currencies; and
 (b) the rate of exchange between those currencies has undergone a short -term fluctuation;
the Minister may, for the purpose of that comparison, disregard that fluctuation.
 (4) If:
 (a) the comparison referred to in subsection  (1) requires the conversion of currencies; and
 (b) the Minister is satisfied that the rate of exchange between those currencies has undergone a sustained movement;
the Minister may, by notice published on the Anti-Dumping Commission&#39;s website, declare that this subsection applies with effect from a day specified in the notice and, if the Minister does so, the Minister may use the rate of exchange in force on that day for the purposes of that comparison during the period of 60 days starting on that day.
 (5) Nothing in subsection  (4) prevents the Minister specifying a day in a notice that is earlier than the day of publication of the notice if the day specified:
 (a) is a day after the start of the sustained movement; and
 (b) is not a day occurring within 60 days after the day specified in a prior notice.
 (6) Nothing in subsection  (4) prevents the Minister publishing more than one notice if a sustained movement in the rate of exchange continues for more than 60 days.
 (7) The Commissioner may, if he or she considers it desirable so to do for the avoidance of doubt, specify, by notice published on the Anti -Dumping Commission&#39;s website, a means of establishing a rate that is taken to be, or to have been, the rate of exchange between the Australian currency and another currency or between other currencies:
 (a) on a day, or during a period, preceding the day of publication of the notice; or
 (b) from and including the day of publication of the notice, or an earlier day specified in the notice, until the revocation of the notice.
 (8) The rate of exchange established between currencies in a notice under subsection  (7) is, for the purpose of working out the amount of duty or interim duty payable on any goods exported on the day or during the period to which the rate so specified applies, the rate of exchange that applies for the purposes of this section in respect of the currencies specified in the notice.

 (a) the Commissioner must give public notice of that determination; and
 (b) the Commonwealth may, at the time that determination is made or at any later time during the investigation, require and take securities under section  42 in respect of interim duty that may become payable if the Commissioner is satisfied that it is necessary to do so to prevent material injury to an Australian industry occurring while the investigation continues.

Termination of investigations

Commissioner must terminate if all dumping margins are negligible
 (1) If:
 (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and
 (b) in an investigation, for the purposes of the application, of an exporter to Australia of goods the subject of the application, the Commissioner is satisfied that:
 (i) there has been no dumping by the exporter of any of those goods; or
 (ii) there has been dumping by the exporter of some or all of those goods, but the dumping margin for the exporter, or each such dumping margin, worked out under section  269TACB, when expressed as a percentage of the export price or weighted average of export prices used to establish that dumping margin, is less than 2%;
the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to the exporter.
Commissioner must terminate if countervailable subsidisation is negligible
 (2) If:
 (a) application is made for a countervailing duty notice; and
 (b) in an investigation, for the purposes of the application, of an exporter to Australia of goods the subject of the application, the Commissioner is satisfied that:
 (i) no countervailable subsidy has been received in respect of any of those goods; or
 (ii) a countervailable subsidy has been received in respect of some or all of those goods but it never, at any time during the investigation period, exceeded the negligible level of countervailable subsidy under subsection  (16);
the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to the exporter.
Commissioner must terminate if negligible volumes of dumping are found
 (3) If:
 (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and
 (b) in an investigation for the purposes of the application the Commissioner is satisfied that the total volume of goods the subject of the application:
 (i) that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over a reasonable examination period from a particular country of export; and
 (ii) that have been, or may be, dumped;
  is negligible;
the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to that country.
What is a negligible volume of dumped goods?
 (4) For the purpose of subsection  (3), the total volume of goods the subject of the application that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over a reasonable examination period from the particular country of export and dumped is taken to be a negligible volume if:
 (a) when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, it is less than 3%; and
 (b) subsection (5) does not apply in relation to those first -mentioned goods.
Aggregation of volumes of dumped goods
 (5) For the purposes of subsection  (4), this subsection applies in relation to goods the subject of the application that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over a reasonable examination period from the particular country of export and dumped if:
 (a) the volume of such goods that have been, or may be, so exported from that country and dumped, when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is less than 3%; and

Negligible dumping margins to count in determining volume
 (6) The fact that the dumping margin, or each of the dumping margins, in relation to a particular exporter, when expressed as a percentage of the export price or weighted average of export prices used to establish that dumping margin, is less than 2%, does not prevent exports by that exporter being taken into account:
 (a) in working out the total volume of goods that have been, or may be, exported from a country of export and dumped; and
 (b) in aggregating, for the purposes of subsection  (5), the volumes of goods that have been, or may be, exported from that country of export and other countries of export and dumped.
Commissioner must terminate if negligible volumes of countervailable subsidisation are found
 (7) If:
 (a) application is made for a countervailing duty notice; and
 (b) in an investigation for the purposes of the application, the Commissioner is satisfied that the total volume of goods the subject of the application:
 (i) that have been, or may be, exported to Australia from a particular country of export during a reasonable examination period; and
 (ii) in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been, or may be, received;
  is negligible;
the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to that country.

 (8) For the purposes of subsection  (7), the total volume of goods the subject of the application for a countervailing duty notice that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over a reasonable examination period from the particular country of export and in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been received is taken to be a negligible volume if:
 (a) that country of export is not a developing country and that total volume, when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is less than 3%; or
 (b) that country of export is a developing country and that total volume, when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is less than 4%;
and subsections (9), (10) and (11) do not apply in relation to those first-mentioned goods.

 (a) the country of export is not a developing country; and
 (b) the volume of such goods:
 (i) that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over that period from that country; and
 (ii) in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been, or may be, received;
  when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is less than 3%; and
 (c) the volume of goods the subject of the application:

 (d) the total volume of goods the subject of the application:
 (i) that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over that period from the country to which paragraph  (b) applies and from all countries to which paragraph (c) applies; and

 (a) the country of export is a developing country; and
 (b) the volume of such goods:
 (i) that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over that period from that country; and
 (ii) in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been, or may be, received;
  when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is less than 4%; and

  when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is more than 9%.
Aggregation of volumes of subsidised goods from member countries that are developing countries
 (11) For the purposes of subsection  (8), this subsection applies in relation to goods the subject of the application that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over a reasonable examination period from the particular country of export and in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been, or may be, received if:
 (a) the country of export is a member country and a developing country; and
 (b) the volume of such goods;
 (i) that have been, or may be exported to Australia over that period from that country; and
 (ii) in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been, or may be, received;
  when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is less than 4%; and

 (ii) in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been, or may be, received;
  when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is more than 9%.
Negligible countervailable subsidies to count in determining volume
 (12) The fact that the level of countervailable subsidy that has been, or may be, received in respect of goods that have been, exported, or may be exported, to Australia from a country of export is a negligible level under subsection  (16) does not prevent exports from that country being taken into account:
 (a) in working out the total volume of goods that have been, or may be, exported from a country of export and in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been, or may be, payable; and
 (b) in aggregating, for the purposes of subsection  (9), (10) or (11), volumes of goods that have been, or may be, exported to Australia from that country and other countries and in respect of which a countervailing subsidy has been, or may be, received.
Commissioner must terminate dumping investigation if export causes negligible injury etc.
 (13) Subject to subsection  (13A), if:
 (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and
 (b) in an investigation, for the purposes of the application, of goods the subject of the application that have been, or may be, exported to Australia from a particular country of export, the Commissioner is satisfied that the injury, if any, to an Australian industry or an industry in a third country, or the hindrance, if any, to the establishment of an Australian industry, that has been, or may be, caused by that export is negligible;
the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to that country.
 (13A) If, in relation to the investigation referred to in subsection  (13), the Commissioner, in accordance with subsection (14B), considers the cumulative effect of exportations of goods to Australia from 2 or more countries of export, then the following apply in relation to those countries:
 (a) if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the injury to an Australian industry or an industry in a third country, or the hindrance to the establishment of an Australian industry, that has been, or may be, caused by those exports is negligible--subsection  (13) does not apply in relation to those countries;
 (b) if the Commissioner is satisfied that such injury or hindrance that has been, or may be, caused by those exports is negligible--the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to those countries.
Note: If the investigation also covers exports of goods from a country that was not part of the cumulation consideration because those exports did not satisfy the criteria in subsection  (14B), then the Commissioner will consider whether subsection (13) applies to that country.
Commissioner must terminate countervailable subsidy investigation if export causes negligible injury
 (14) Subject to subsection  (14A), if:
 (a) application is made for a countervailing duty notice; and
 (b) in an investigation, for the purpose of the application, of goods the subject of the application that have been, or may be, exported to Australia from a particular country of export, the Commissioner is satisfied that the injury, if any, to an Australian industry or an industry in a third country that has been, or may be, caused by that export is negligible;
the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to that country.
 (14A) If, in relation to the investigation referred to in subsection  (14), the Commissioner, in accordance with subsection (14B), considers the cumulative effect of exportations of goods to Australia from 2 or more countries of export, then the following apply in relation to those countries:
 (a) if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the injury to an Australian industry or an industry in a third country that has been, or may be, caused by those exports is negligible--subsection  (14) does not apply in relation to those countries;
 (b) if the Commissioner is satisfied that such injury that has been, or may be, caused by those exports is negligible--the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to those countries.
Note: If the investigation also covers exports of goods from a country that was not part of the cumulation consideration because those exports did not satisfy the criteria in subsection  (14B), then the Commissioner will consider whether subsection (14) applies to that country.
Cumulative assessment of injury or hindrance
 (14B) For the purpose of subsection  (13A) or (14A), the Commissioner must consider the cumulative effect of exportations of goods to Australia from 2 or more countries of export if the Commissioner is satisfied that:
 (a) each of those exportations is the subject of an investigation; and
 (b) either:
 (i) all the investigations of those exportations resulted from applications under section  269TB lodged with the Commissioner on the same day; or
 (ii) the investigations of those exportations resulted from applications under section  269TB lodged with the Commissioner on different days but the investigation periods for all the investigations of those exportations overlap significantly; and
 (c) for the purposes of subsection  (13A)--the dumping margin worked out under section 269TACB for the exporter for each of the exportations is at least 2% of the export price or weighted average of export prices used to establish that dumping margin; and
 (d) for the purposes of subsection  (13A)--for each application, the volume of goods the subject of the application that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over a reasonable examination period (as defined in subsection  269TDA(17)) from the country of export and dumped is not taken to be negligible for the purposes of subsection 269TDA(3) because of subsection  269TDA(4); and
 (e) for the purposes of subsection  (14A):
 (i) the amount of the countervailable subsidy in respect of the goods the subject of each of the exportations exceeds the negligible level of countervailable subsidy worked out under subsection  269TDA(16); and
 (ii) the volume of each of those exportations is not negligible; and
 (f) it is appropriate to consider the cumulative effect of those exportations, having regard to:
 (i) the conditions of competition between those goods; and
 (ii) the conditions of competition between those goods and like goods that are domestically produced.
Commissioner must give public notice of termination decisions
 (15) If the Commissioner decides to terminate an investigation so far as it relates to a particular exporter or country of export, the Commissioner must:
 (a) give public notice of that decision; and
 (b) ensure that:
 (i) in the case of an exporter, a copy of the notice is sent to the applicant, the exporter and the government of the country of export; or
 (ii) in the case of a country of export, a copy of the notice is sent to the applicant and the government of that country; and
 (c) inform the applicant of the applicant&#39;s right, within 30 days after the first publication of the public notice, to apply for a review of the Commissioner&#39;s decision by the Review Panel under Division  9.
Negligible countervailable subsidisation
 (16) For the purposes of this section, a countervailable subsidy received in respect of goods exported to Australia is negligible if:
 (a) the country of export is not a developing country and the subsidy, when expressed as a percentage of the export price of the goods, is less than 1%; or
 (b) the country of export is a developing country but not a special developing country and the subsidy, when expressed as a percentage of the export price of the goods, is not more than 2%; or
 (c) the country of export is a special developing country and the subsidy, when expressed as a percentage of the export price of the goods, is not more than 3%.

 (a) the whole or a substantial part of the investigation period; or
 (b) any period after the end of the investigation period that is taken into account for the purpose of considering possible future importations of goods the subject of the application.

Dumping duties

 (1) Subject to section  269TN, where the Minister is satisfied, as to any goods that have been exported to Australia, that:
 (a) the amount of the export price of the goods is less than the amount of the normal value of those goods; and
 (b) because of that:
 (i) material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods has been or is being caused or is threatened, or the establishment of an Australian industry producing like goods has been or may be materially hindered; or
 (ii) in a case where security has been taken under section  42 in respect of any interim duty that may become payable on the goods under section 8 of the Dumping Duty Act--material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods would or might have been caused if the security had not been taken;
the Minister may, by public notice, declare that section 8 of that Act applies:
 (c) to the goods in respect of which the Minister is so satisfied; and
 (d) to like goods that were exported to Australia after the Commissioner made a preliminary affirmative determination under section  269TD in respect of the goods referred to in paragraph (c) but before the publication of that notice.
 (2) Where the Minister is satisfied, as to goods of any kind, that:
 (a) the amount of the export price of like goods that have already been exported to Australia is less than the amount of the normal value of those goods, and the amount of the export price of like goods that may be exported to Australia in the future may be less than the normal value of the goods; and
 (b) because of that, material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods has been or is being caused or is threatened, or the establishment of an Australian industry producing like goods has been or may be materially hindered;
the Minister may, by public notice (whether or not he or she has made, or proposes to make, a declaration under subsection (1) in respect of like goods that have been exported to Australia), declare that section  8 of the Dumping Duty Act applies to like goods that are exported to Australia after the date of publication of the notice or such later date as is specified in the notice.
 (3) Where:
 (a) a notice under subsection  (1) declares particular goods to be goods to which section 8 of the Dumping Duty Act applies; or
 (b) a notice under subsection  (2) declares like goods in relation to goods of a particular kind to be goods to which that section applies;
the notice must, subject to subsection (3A), include a statement of the respective amounts that the Minister ascertained, at the time of publication of the notice:
 (c) was or would be the normal value of the goods to which the declaration relates; and
 (d) was or would be the export price of those goods; and
 (e) was or would be the non -injurious price of those goods.
 (3A) If any person who has provided information to assist the Minister to ascertain the normal value, export price or non -injurious price of goods to which a declaration under subsection (1) or (2) relates claims, in writing, that the information is confidential or that the inclusion in a notice under that subsection of that value or price would adversely affect the person&#39;s business or commercial interests:
 (a) in accordance with subsection  269ZI(9) the Minister is not required to include in the notice a statement of that value or price; but
 (b) upon request the Commissioner may notify that value or price to persons who, in the Commissioner&#39;s opinion, would be affected parties in any review of the rate of interim duty imposed on like goods to the goods to which the declaration relates.
 (3D) If the export of a consignment of goods to Australia by an exporter has been under consideration by the Minister so as to decide whether or not to publish a dumping duty notice under this section in relation to the goods in the consignment or to like goods, the Minister may give notice, in writing, to the exporter stating that:
 (a) the Minister is of the opinion that it would be appropriate for the exporter to give an undertaking in accordance with subsection  (4) to the Minister; and
 (b) an undertaking, in the terms set out in the notice, would be satisfactory to the Minister.
 (4) Whether or not a notice has been given to an exporter, the Minister may defer the decision to publish or not to publish a dumping duty notice covering that exporter, for so long as the Minister considers appropriate, if the exporter offers, and the Minister accepts, an undertaking that the exporter will so conduct future trade to Australia in like goods as to avoid:
 (a) causing or threatening material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods; or
 (b) materially hindering the establishment of such an Australian industry.
 (5) In giving a notice, and in considering the terms of any proposed undertaking, the Minister must have regard to the desirability that any price increase to which the undertaking relates is limited to an amount such that the total price of the goods is not more than the non -injurious price of the goods.
 (5A) However, subsection  (5) does not require the Minister to have regard to the matter in that subsection if the Minister is satisfied that either or both of the following apply in relation to the goods in the consignment:
 (a) the normal value of the goods was not ascertained under subsection  269TAC(1) because of the operation of subparagraph 269TAC(2)(a)(ii);
 (b) there is an Australian industry in respect of like goods that consists of at least 2 small -medium enterprises, whether or not that industry consists of other enterprises.

 (a) may give a notice to an exporter under subsection  (3D) whether or not the giving of such a notice has been recommended by the Commissioner in a report under section 269TEA; and
 (b) may accept an undertaking whether or not the acceptance of such an undertaking has been recommended by the Commissioner in a recommendation under section  269TEB; and
 (c) must not give a notice to an exporter under subsection  (3D), or accept an undertaking from an exporter, before a preliminary affirmative determination, or an equivalent determination in an investigation conducted under section 269TAG, has been made that extends to that exporter; and
 (d) must give public notice of any undertaking so accepted.
 (7) The acceptance by the Minister of an undertaking may be subject to conditions that include, but are not limited to, conditions relating to:
 (a) giving the Minister, on an agreed basis, information that is relevant to the fulfilment of the undertaking; and
 (b) providing the Minister with appropriate access to such information.
 (8) The acceptance by the Minister of an undertaking from an exporter does not prevent the exporter requesting the Minister to determine whether, had the undertaking not been accepted, the Minister would have published a dumping duty notice or would have decided not to publish such a notice.
 (9) The Minister must, if an exporter makes such a request, and may, on his or her own initiative, determine whether he or she would have published a dumping duty notice or would have decided not to publish such a notice if the undertaking had not been accepted.
 (10) Subsection (9) does not imply that the Minister is required to make a determination under that subsection before the Minister has received a report of the Commissioner in relation to the matter.
 (11) If the Minister determines under subsection  (9) that he or she would have decided not to publish a dumping duty notice, the undertaking automatically lapses.

 (i) material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods has been or is being caused or is threatened or the establishment of an Australian industry producing like goods has been or may be materially hindered; or
 (ii) in a case where security has been taken under section  42 in respect of any interim duty that may become payable on the goods under section 10 of the Dumping Duty Act--material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods would or might have been caused if the security had not been taken;
the Minister may, by public notice, declare that section 10 of that Act applies:
 (c) to the goods in respect of which the Minister is so satisfied; and
 (d) to like goods that were exported to Australia after the Commissioner made a preliminary affirmative determination under section  269TD in respect of the goods referred to in paragraph (c) but before the publication of that notice.

 (b) because of that, material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods has been or is being caused or is being threatened, or the establishment of an Australian industry producing like goods has been or may be materially hindered;
the Minister may, by public notice (whether or not he or she has made, or proposes to make, a declaration under subsection (1) in respect of like goods that have been exported to Australia), declare that section  10 of the Dumping Duty Act applies to like goods that are exported to Australia after the date of publication of the notice or such later date as is specified in the notice.
 (2A) If the export of a consignment of goods to Australia has been under consideration by the Minister so as to decide whether or not to publish a countervailing duty notice under this section in relation to the goods in the consignment or to like goods, the Minister may give notice, in writing, to the government of the country of export or to the exporter stating that:

 (3A) This subsection applies:
 (a) to an undertaking given by a government--if it is an undertaking that the government will, in relation to any export trade to Australia in like goods, review any countervailable subsidy delivered by that government and make any changes found to be necessary to avoid:
 (i) causing or threatening material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods; or

 (a) the country of export has not complied with Article 25 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures for the compliance period;
 (b) there is an Australian industry in respect of like goods that consists of at least 2 small -medium enterprises, whether or not that industry consists of other enterprises.

 (d) must not accept an undertaking from an exporter unless the government of the country of export consents to the giving of the undertaking; and
 (e) must give public notice of any undertaking so accepted.

 (a) giving the Minister, on an agreed basis, information that is relevant to the fulfilment of the undertaking; and
 (b) providing the Minister with appropriate access to such information.

 (a) provisionally ascertain, in relation to each consignment of goods to which the application relates, each variable factor relevant to the determination of duty payable on the goods under the Dumping Duty Act; and
 (b) having regard to those variable factors as so provisionally ascertained and, where appropriate, to the non -injurious price of goods of that kind--provisionally calculate, in respect of each such consignment, the amount of duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act.
 (5A) Subsection (5B) of this section applies if the Commissioner proposes to ascertain provisionally, for the purposes of paragraph  (5)(a) of this section, the export price of goods (under paragraph 269TAB(1)(b) or otherwise) as the difference between:
 (a) the price at which the importer of the goods sold them, in the condition in which they were imported, to someone who was not an associate of the importer; and
 (b) the prescribed deductions (as defined in subsection  269TAB(2)) relating to the goods.
 (5B) In provisionally ascertaining the export price of goods as described in subsection  (5A), the Commissioner must:
 (a) take account of the following in relation to the goods:
 (i) any change in normal value;
 (ii) any change in costs incurred between importation and resale;
 (iii) any movement in resale price which is duly reflected in subsequent selling prices; and
 (b) despite paragraph  269TAB(1)(b), not deduct the amount of interim duty if the Commissioner has conclusive evidence of the things mentioned in subparagraphs (a)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this subsection.
An expression used in this subsection and subparagraph 3.3 of Article 9 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 set out in Annex  1A to the World Trade Organization Agreement has the same meaning in this subsection as it has in that subparagraph.
 (6) On the basis of the provisional calculation of duty referred to in paragraph  (5)(b), the Commissioner must decide:
 (a) if satisfied that the total interim duty paid on the goods the subject of the application exceeds the total duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act by at least the amount contended in the application--to recommend to the Minister:
 (i) that the Minister make an assessment of duty by ascertaining, for each consignment of those goods, the variable factors as so provisionally ascertained; and
 (ii) that the Minister order a repayment of the amount of interim duty overpaid; or
 (b) if satisfied that the total interim duty paid on the goods the subject of the application exceeds the total duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act but not to the extent contended in the application--to recommend to the Minister:
 (i) that the Minister make an assessment of duty by ascertaining, for each consignment of those goods, the variable factors as so provisionally ascertained; and
 (ii) that the Minister order a repayment of the amount of interim duty overpaid; or
 (c) if satisfied that the total amount of duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act on the goods the subject of the application is equal to or exceeds the total of interim duty that was paid on the goods--to recommend to the Minister:
 (i) that the Minister make an assessment of duty by ascertaining, for each consignment of those goods, the variable factors as so provisionally ascertained; but
 (ii) that the Minister order that any duty in excess of the interim duty paid on those goods be waived.
 (7) As soon as practicable, but not later than 7 days after making a decision under subsection  (6), the Commissioner must:
 (a) notify the applicant, in writing, of the decision made; and
 (b) if the decision is a negative preliminary decision:
 (i) inform the applicant of the reasons why the Commissioner made the decision; and
 (ii) inform the applicant of the applicant&#39;s right, within 30 days of the receipt of the notification, to apply for a review of the Commissioner&#39;s decision by the Review Panel under Division  9.

 (b) if he or she has made a negative preliminary decision and the applicant has not exercised the right to seek a review of the decision by the Review Panel--recommend to the Minister, not later than 7 days after the end of the period available for seeking review of the decision, that the Minister give effect to that decision.

- SECT 269ZA
Applications and requests for review of anti - dumping measures

 (1) If:
 (a) anti-dumping measures have been taken in respect of goods; and
 (b) an affected party considers that it may be appropriate to review those measures as they affect a particular exporter of those goods, or as they affect exporters of those goods generally, because:
 (i) one or more of the variable factors relevant to the taking of the measures in relation to that exporter or those exporters have changed; or
 (ii) the anti-dumping measures are no longer warranted;
the affected party may, by application lodged with the Commissioner, request that the Commissioner initiate such a review.
 (2) An application for review of anti -dumping measures must not be made:
 (a) if the measures involve the publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice--earlier than 12 months after:
 (i) the publication of the notice; or
 (ii) the publication of a notice declaring the outcome of the last review of the notice (whether that last review was undertaken at the applicant&#39;s request or not); and
 (b) if the measures involve the acceptance of an undertaking--earlier than 12 months after:
 (i) the publication of notice of the acceptance of that undertaking; or
 (ii) the publication of a notice declaring the outcome of the last review of the undertaking (whether that last review was undertaken at the applicant&#39;s request or not).
Example: If an application under section 269TB resulted in:
        (a) the publication of the acceptance of an undertaking from exporter A on 1 January 1999; and
        (b) the publication of a dumping duty notice covering exporters B and C on 1 March 1999;
 an affected party could seek review of the undertaking on 2 January 2000 but could not seek review of both the undertaking and the dumping duty notices until 2  March 2000.
 However, the Minister could decide to review the notices before 2 March 2000 either on his or her own initiative or on the recommendation of the Commissioner. See subsection  (3).
 (3) If:
 (a) anti-dumping measures have been taken in respect of goods; and
 (b) the Minister considers (either as a result of a recommendation from the Commissioner under subsection  269ZC(4) or on his or her own initiative) that it may be appropriate to review those measures as they affect a particular exporter of those goods, or as they affect exporters of those goods generally, because:
 (i) one or more of the variable factors relevant to the taking of the measures in relation to that exporter or those exporters may have changed; or
 (ii) the anti-dumping measures are no longer warranted;
the Minister may, at any time, by notice in writing, request that the Commissioner initiate a review under this Division.
 (4) If, as a result of a person&#39;s application under Division  6 for accelerated review of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice, the Minister has made a declaration under subsection 269ZG(3):
 (a) that person may not make an application, under subsection  (1) of this section, for a review of that notice earlier than 12 months after the making of that declaration; but
 (b) for the purpose of determining whether subsection  (2) permits any other person to apply for a review of the notice, the making of that declaration is not to be treated as a review of the notice.
 (5) If:
 (a) a person applies, under Division  9, for a review of the Minister&#39;s decision to publish a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice or not to publish such a notice; and
 (b) as a result of that review:
 (i) a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice is published by the Minister despite an earlier decision not to publish such a notice; or
 (ii) a dumping duty notice or countervailing duty notice originally published by the Minister is varied; or
 (iii) another dumping duty notice or countervailing duty notice is substituted for the notice originally published by the Minister;
then, for the purpose only of determining whether subsection (2) permits a review of the new notice, the notice as varied or the substituted notice, that new notice, notice as varied or substituted notice has effect as if it had been published at the time of the Minister&#39;s decision not to publish a notice, or at the time of publication of the original notice, as the case requires.
