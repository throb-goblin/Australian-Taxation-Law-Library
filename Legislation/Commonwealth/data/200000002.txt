(2) If the Secretary calculates an indexed estimate for the individual, the Secretary may give the claimant a notice:
(a) stating the indexed estimate for the individual; and
(b) specifying the start day used in the Secretary’s calculation (which must be at least 14 days after the day on which the notice is given).
(3) The Secretary must not give a notice under subsection (2) stating an indexed estimate for the individual with a start day in an income year if the Secretary has already given a notice under subsection (2) stating an indexed estimate for that individual with a start day in the same income year.
(4) A notice given to a claimant under subsection (2) stating an indexed estimate for an individual has no effect if, before the start day specified in the notice for the indexed estimate, the Secretary gives the claimant a notice under subsection 20B(2) stating an indexed actual income for the same individual. Any such notice under subsection 20B(2) must specify a start day that is no earlier than the start day specified in the superseded notice.
(5) Calculate an indexed estimate (which may be nil) for the individual by multiplying the individual’s current ATI number (see subsection (6)) by the indexation factor, rounding the result to the nearest dollar and rounding 50 cents upwards. The indexation factor is the greater of 1 and the factor worked out to 3 decimal places as follows (increasing the factor by 0.001 if it would, if worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number greater than 4):
where:
AWE means the amount published by the Australian Statistician in a document titled “Average Weekly Earnings” under the headings “Average Weekly Earnings, Australia—Original—Persons—All employees total earnings” (or, if any of those change, in a replacement document or under replacement headings).
highest previous November means the November in which, of all the Novembers from November 2004 to the November before the most recent November (inclusive), AWE was the highest.
most recent November means the November of the income year before the income year in which the start day occurs.
reference period , in a particular November, means the period described by the Australian Statistician as the last pay period ending on or before a specified day that is the third Friday of that November.

(a) if, at the time of calculation, the Secretary has given the claimant a notice under subsection 20B(2) stating an indexed actual income for the individual with a start day that has not arrived—the indexed actual income stated in the notice; or
(b) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the individual is the claimant—the amount the Secretary is permitted to use for the individual under section 20 (disregarding the effect for couples of section 20C of this Act and clause 3 of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act); or
(c) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the individual is the claimant’s partner—the amount the Secretary would be permitted to use for the individual under section 20 if the individual were the claimant (disregarding the effect for couples of section 20C of this Act and clause 3 of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act).
(7) A notice under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

(c) the determination includes a determination of the claimant’s rate of family tax benefit worked out on the basis of an indexed estimate for the claimant or an indexed actual income for the claimant; and
(d) since the claimant was last given a notice under subsection 20A(2) or subsection (2) of this section stating an indexed estimate or indexed actual income for an individual, the claimant has not given the Secretary an estimate of the claimant’s adjusted taxable income that the Secretary considers to be reasonable; and
(e) the adjusted taxable income for an income year ( actual income ) of the individual (disregarding the effect for couples of clause 3 of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act) becomes known to the Secretary and it is the most recent income year for which the individual’s actual income is known to the Secretary.
Note: Section 20C affects the meaning of paragraph (1)(c) for members of couples.
(2) If:
(a) the Secretary calculates an indexed actual income for the individual; and
(b) the indexed actual income is greater than the individual’s current ATI number (see subsection (5));
the Secretary may give the claimant a notice:
(c) stating the indexed actual income for the individual; and
(d) specifying the start day used in the Secretary’s calculation (which must be at least 14 days after the day on which the notice is given).
(3) A notice given to a claimant under subsection (2) stating an indexed actual income for an individual has no effect if, before the start day specified in the notice, the Secretary gives the claimant another notice under that subsection or a notice under subsection 20A(2) stating an indexed estimate or indexed actual income for the same individual. Any other such notice must specify a start day that is no earlier than the start day specified in the superseded notice.
(4) Calculate an indexed actual income (which may be nil) for the individual by multiplying the actual income of the individual which became known to the Secretary by the indexation factor, rounding the result to the nearest dollar and rounding 50 cents upwards. The indexation factor is the greater of 1 and the factor worked out to 3 decimal places as follows (increasing the factor by 0.001 if it would, if worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number greater than 4):
where:
AWE means the amount published by the Australian Statistician in a document titled “Average Weekly Earnings” under the headings “Average Weekly Earnings, Australia—Original—Persons—All employees total earnings” (or, if any of those change, in a replacement document or under replacement headings).

most recent November means the November of the income year before the income year in which the start day occurs.
reference period , in a particular November, means the period described by the Australian Statistician as the last pay period ending on or before a specified day that is the third Friday of that November.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), the individual’s current ATI number is:
(a) if, at the time of calculation, the Secretary has given the claimant a notice under subsection 20A(2) or subsection (2) of this section stating an indexed estimate or indexed actual income for the individual with a start day that has not arrived—the indexed estimate or indexed actual income stated in the notice; or
(b) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the individual is the claimant—the amount the Secretary is permitted to use for the individual under section 20 (disregarding the effect for couples of section 20C of this Act and clause 3 of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act); or
(c) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the individual is the claimant’s partner—the amount the Secretary would be permitted to use for the individual under section 20 if the individual were the claimant (disregarding the effect for couples of section 20C of this Act and clause 3 of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act).

Method statement
Step 1. Work out the total amount of family tax benefit the claimant is or was entitled to be paid during the period beginning at the start of the income year and ending at the end of the day before the applicable day.
Step 2. Work out the total amount of family tax benefit the claimant would have been entitled to be paid during that period if the claimant’s rate of family tax benefit were calculated using:
(a) if subparagraph (1)(b)(i) applies—the revised estimate concerned; or
(b) if subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) applies—the revised estimate concerned; or
(c) if subparagraph (1)(b)(iii) applies—the indexed estimate concerned; or
(d) if subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) applies—the indexed actual income concerned; or
(e) if subparagraph (1)(b)(v) applies—the revised estimate concerned; or
(f) if subparagraph (1)(b)(vi) applies—the revised estimate concerned; or
(g) if subparagraph (1)(b)(vii) applies—the estimate of the claimant’s adjusted taxable income for the income year, and the estimate of the claimant’s maintenance income in that income year, that were used in determining the claimant’s rate of family tax benefit under the other determination referred to in that subparagraph.
Step 3. Take the amount worked out at step 2 away from the amount worked out at step 1.
Step 4. If the amount worked out at step 3 is greater than zero, work out the number of days during the period beginning on the applicable day and ending at the end of the last day in the income year.
Step 5. Work out the daily overpayment rate by dividing the amount worked out at step 3 by the number of days worked out at step 4, and rounding the result of the division to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards).
(3) If there is a daily overpayment rate, the Secretary must vary the applicable determination so that the claimant’s daily rate of family tax benefit for the period beginning on the applicable day and ending at the end of the last day in the income year is reduced (but not below nil) by that daily overpayment rate.
(3A) For the purposes of subsection (3), the applicable determination is:
(a) if subparagraph (1)(b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) applies—the determination referred to in paragraph (1)(a); or
(b) if subparagraph (1)(b)(vii) applies—the other determination referred to in that subparagraph.
(4) This section may have more than one application in relation to the claimant during the income year.
(5) In this section:
applicable day means:
(a) if subparagraph (1)(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) applies—the day on which the variation concerned has effect; and
(b) if subparagraph (1)(b)(v) or (vi) applies—the first day of the instalment period in which the Secretary applies the method statement because of that subparagraph applying; and
(c) if subparagraph (1)(b)(vii) applies—the first day in the income year for which the claimant’s entitlement to be paid family tax benefit arose under the other determination referred to in that subparagraph.

Subdivision CB — Non ‑ entitlement to FTB on estimated income basis

32AF Non ‑ entitlement to FTB on estimated income basis—review of income during 2 consecutive income years
Scope of Subdivision
(1) This Subdivision applies in relation to an individual if:
(a) there are 2 consecutive income years (each of which is a consecutive year ) in which there are one or more days for which the individual was entitled to be paid family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis; and
(b) in respect of each consecutive year, the Secretary, under section 105, reviews the rate of family benefit the individual was entitled to be paid for those days on the basis of the individual’s adjusted taxable income as finally determined in respect of the consecutive year by the Secretary; and
(c) as a result of the review and in respect of each consecutive year, the Secretary determines either or both of the following:
(i) the individual’s Part A rate of family tax benefit is nil for those days because of the individual’s adjusted taxable income, and there are no other days in either consecutive year for which the individual was entitled to be paid the Part A rate;
(ii) the individual’s Part B rate of family tax benefit is nil for those days because of subclause 28B(1) of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act.
Note: Family tax benefit may be worked out on an estimated income basis under subsection 20(1), (2A) or (3) (see definition of estimated income basis in subsection 3(1)).
Basic non ‑ entitlement rule
(2) Subject to this Subdivision:
(a) if subparagraph (1)(c)(i) applies—the individual is not entitled, on and after the exclusion day, to be paid the Part A rate of family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis; and
(b) if subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) applies—the individual is not entitled, on and after the exclusion day, to be paid the Part B rate of family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis.
(3) For the purposes of this Subdivision, the exclusion day , in relation to an individual, is:
(a) either:
(i) if the later of the consecutive years is 2010 ‑ 11—1 July 2012; or
(ii) in any other case—1 July of the first income year after the later of the consecutive years; or
(b) if the Secretary determines a later day in relation to the individual—the later day.
(4) A determination under paragraph (3)(b) is not a legislative instrument.
Position of individual’s partner
(5) While paragraph (2)(a) applies in relation to the individual, the individual’s partner (if any) is not entitled to be paid the Part A rate of family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis.
(6) While paragraph (2)(b) applies in relation to the individual, the individual’s partner (if any) is not entitled to be paid the Part B rate of family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis.
Multiple applications of section
(7) Sections 32AG to 32AM do not prevent this section applying again in relation to the individual in respect of 2 consecutive income years, either or both of which are different from the 2 consecutive income years the subject of the previous application of this section.

32AG Exception—greater than nil rate of FTB for later income year
Scope
(1) This section applies if, in respect of an income year (the payment year ) after the later of the consecutive years, the Secretary, taking into account the individual’s adjusted taxable income as finally determined in respect of the payment year by the Secretary, determines either or both of the following on a day (the payment day ):
(a) the individual’s Part A rate of family tax benefit is greater than nil on one or more days in the payment year;
(b) the individual’s Part B rate of family tax benefit is greater than nil on one or more days in the payment year.
Payment day is in same income year as exclusion day
(2) If the payment day is in the income year in which the exclusion day occurs, then:
(a) if this section applies in relation to the Part A rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(a) is taken not to have applied in relation to the individual; and
(b) if this section applies in relation to the Part B rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(b) is taken not to have applied in relation to the individual.
Example: Assume that under section 32AF the consecutive years are 2009 ‑ 10 and 2010 ‑ 11. Assume that the individual is not entitled, on and after 1 July 2012, to be paid the Part A rate and Part B rate of family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis. The exclusion day is 1 July 2012.
Assume that on 1 November 2012 the Secretary determines, under subsection (1), that the individual’s Part A rate and Part B rate of family tax benefit are greater than nil on one or more days in 2011 ‑ 12. The payment day is 1 November 2012.
Under subsection (2), subsection 32AF(2) is taken not to have prevented the individual from being entitled, on and after 1 July 2012, to be paid family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis.
Payment day is in income year later than that of exclusion day
(3) If the payment day is in an income year that is later than the income year in which the exclusion day occurs, then:
(a) if this section applies in relation to the Part A rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(a) ceases to apply in relation to the individual on 1 July of the later income year; and
(b) if this section applies in relation to the Part B rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(b) ceases to apply in relation to the individual on 1 July of the later income year.

Part 3A — Payment of child care subsidy and additional child care subsidy

Division 1 — Introduction

67AA Simplified outline of this Part
Individuals must make a claim for CCS in order to become entitled to be paid CCS or ACCS in relation to child care provided to a child.
In order to become entitled to be paid ACCS (grandparent) or ACCS (transition to work), an application is needed as well as the claim for CCS.
The Secretary will determine whether an individual is eligible for CCS for a child. If the individual is eligible, weekly determinations are then made about how much (if any) CCS or ACCS is to be paid each week.
Weekly payments are mostly made via the child care service provider, who will pass them on to the individual (usually as a fee reduction).
Broadly, recipients of CCS and ACCS have responsibilities to keep the Secretary informed about changes in their circumstances that might affect their eligibility for or entitlement to CCS or ACCS, and to respond to requests for information.
An approved provider who is eligible for ACCS (child wellbeing) for a child does not need to make a claim, but does need to make a declaration in order to become entitled to be paid the ACCS. Providers also have responsibilities to keep the Secretary informed and respond to requests for information.
It is also possible for individuals to claim CCS or ACCS in substitution for an individual who has died. If an individual is entitled to be paid such an amount, it is paid directly to the individual.
Note: For the constitutional basis of the provisions of this Act in relation to child care subsidy and additional child care subsidy (including provisions in relation to approved providers), see section 85AB of the Family Assistance Act.

67AB Forms of CCS and ACCS
(1) An individual may, in accordance with this Part, become entitled to be paid:
(a) CCS by fee reduction;
(b) ACCS by fee reduction;
(c) CCS or ACCS in substitution for an individual who has died.
(2) An approved provider may, in accordance with this Part, become entitled to be paid ACCS (child wellbeing).

Division 2 — Making claims

67BA Simplified outline of this Division
Claims for CCS must include particular information and be made in a particular way. Among other things, information is needed about bank account details and tax file numbers.
A claim that does not meet the requirements is taken not to have been made.

67BB Need for a claim
The only way that an individual (other than an approved provider) can become entitled to be paid CCS or ACCS is to make a claim in respect of a child for CCS in accordance with this Division.
Note 1: As well as making a claim for CCS, an individual who wants to be paid ACCS (grandparent) or ACCS (transition to work) must apply for that kind of ACCS. See paragraphs 67CD(4)(a) and (6)(a).
Note 2: An approved provider does not have to make a claim to be entitled to be paid ACCS (child wellbeing), but does need to make a declaration. See paragraph 67CH(1)(c).

67BC Who can claim
The only persons who can make a claim for CCS in accordance with this Division are individuals.

67BD Kinds of claims
An individual may make a claim in respect of a child for CCS:
(a) by fee reduction; or
(b) in substitution for an individual who has died.

67BE When a claim is effective
(1) A claim made by an individual in respect of a child for CCS is effective if:
(a) the claim is made in a form and manner approved by the Secretary; and
(b) the claim contains the information, and is accompanied by the documents, required by the Secretary; and
(c) the claim contains details of a bank account, maintained by the individual alone or jointly with someone else, into which amounts of CCS or ACCS can be paid; and
(d) unless paragraph (e) applies—the claim contains the tax file number of each TFN claim person; and
(e) if the claim is for CCS in substitution for an individual who has died—the claim contains the tax file number of each TFN substitution person; and
(f) if the claim is for CCS in substitution for an individual who has died—the claim is made before the end of the income year after the income year in which the individual died; and
(g) any other requirements in the Secretary’s rules are met; and
(h) no other provision in this Division prevents the claim being effective.
(2) The Secretary may make a written determination that paragraph (1)(d) does not apply in relation to a claim for 28 days after the day the determination is made, if the Secretary is satisfied that it is appropriate in the circumstances to do so.
(3) If:
(a) a determination under subsection (2) is made in relation to a claim; and
(b) the Secretary is satisfied that it is appropriate in the circumstances that paragraph (1)(d) not apply in relation to the claim indefinitely;
the Secretary may, before the end of the 28 days after the day the determination is made, make a further written determination accordingly.

67BF Claims that are taken not to have been made
(1) A claim that is not effective is taken not to have been made.
(2) A claim is taken not to have been made by an individual if:
(a) the Secretary has made a determination under subsection 67BE(2) in relation to the claim; and

(3) The Secretary’s rules may prescribe other circumstances in which a claim is taken not to have been made.

Division 3 — Determinations

Subdivision A — Entitlement to be paid CCS or ACCS

67CA Simplified outline of this Division
An individual or an approved provider who is eligible for CCS or ACCS is only entitled to be paid CCS or ACCS if the Secretary has made a determination to that effect.
For individuals who claim in respect of a child for CCS by fee reduction, the Secretary will make an initial determination of the individual’s eligibility for CCS for the child. Once this is in effect, determinations are made, for each week, about the individual’s entitlement to CCS or ACCS that week.
To be entitled to be paid for a week, the individual must:
(a) be eligible for CCS or ACCS (generally); and
(b) meet some additional entitlement conditions.
The additional entitlement conditions mean that not everyone who is eligible for CCS or ACCS will be entitled to be paid for every week. In particular, individuals need to have met the CCS reconciliation conditions for previous income years for which they were entitled to CCS (usually these conditions are met by obtaining a timely tax assessment) and to have kept the Secretary up to date about changes affecting eligibility or entitlement.
Even if the Secretary determines that an individual is entitled to be paid CCS for a week, the individual might later have to repay the CCS if the individual does not meet the CCS reconciliation conditions. (This does not apply to ACCS.)
Determinations are also made each week in relation to an approved provider’s entitlement to be paid ACCS (child wellbeing) for a child.
One ‑ off determinations are made in relation to an individual’s entitlement to be paid CCS or ACCS in substitution for an individual who has died.

67CB Entitlement to be paid CCS or ACCS
(1) An individual or an approved provider is only entitled to be paid CCS or ACCS if the Secretary has made a determination to that effect under this Division.
(2) The Secretary is to make determinations under this Division on the basis of the information available to the Secretary at the time of making the determination.
Note: Part 5 provides for review of determinations, including in relation to the use of information in circumstances where information becomes available after a determination is made.
(3) At any time, an individual or an approved provider is entitled to be paid, in accordance with this Part, the amount of CCS or ACCS (if any) for a week specified in whichever child care decision is in effect at the time for the week.
(4) However, an individual who is entitled to be paid CCS for sessions of care provided to a child in a week:
(a) ceases to be entitled to be paid that CCS, and is taken never to have been entitled to be paid that CCS, if the individual has not met the CCS reconciliation conditions, for the income year in which the CCS fortnight that includes the week starts, by the first deadline for the income year; and
(b) cannot again become entitled to be paid that CCS before the individual meets the CCS reconciliation conditions for the income year.
Note 1: See section 105E for the determinations the Secretary is required to make in these circumstances.
Note 2: CCS payments for an income year are capped if the CCS reconciliation conditions for the income year are met after the second deadline for the income year (see subsection 105D(2A)).
(5) Subsection (4) applies despite any other provision of this Act or the Family Assistance Act or any determination in effect to the contrary.

Subdivision B — Determinations for individuals claiming CCS by fee reduction

67CC Determination of individual’s eligibility for CCS by fee reduction

(a) the Secretary is satisfied that the individual has ceased to be eligible, and is not reasonably likely to become eligible again, for CCS by fee reduction for sessions of care provided to the child;
(b) the Secretary has made determinations under subsection 67CD(8) in relation to the individual (otherwise than because of subsection 105E(2)) for:

(d) a report under section 204B for a week, indicating that a session of care in relation to which the individual is the claimant has been provided to the child in the week, has not been given to the Secretary in relation to:
(i) unless subparagraph (ii) applies—at least 26 consecutive weeks; or
(ii) if the Minister’s rules prescribe a different number of consecutive weeks for the purposes of this subparagraph—at least that number of consecutive weeks;
(e) the Secretary is satisfied that the individual:
(i) does not intend that the child be enrolled for care by a child care service; or
(ii) does not intend that the child attend any sessions of care provided by a child care service.

Division 4 — Estimates etc. of adjusted taxable income

67DA Simplified outline of this Division
To work out the amount of CCS an individual is entitled to be paid for a week, it is necessary to know the individual’s adjusted taxable income for the income year the week relates to.
The final amount of the individual’s income for the income year usually cannot be known until after the income year has ended.
In the meantime, the Secretary is able to rely on an estimate provided by the individual, or on an indexed estimate or the indexed actual income of an earlier income year.
After the individual meets the CCS reconciliation conditions, any underpayment to the individual will generally be topped up and any overpayments become debts due to the Commonwealth.

67DB Determinations when adjusted taxable income is not known
Determinations under section 67CD
(1) This section applies if, at the time of making a determination under section 67CD for a week in a CCS fortnight, for an individual who is not eligible for any kind of ACCS, the individual has not met the CCS reconciliation conditions.
Estimate
(2) The Secretary may make the determination under section 67CD on the basis of the most recent of whichever of the following estimates (if any) exists on the first Monday of the CCS fortnight:
(a) a reasonable estimate given to the Secretary by the individual;
(b) the indexed estimate stated in a notice given to the individual under section 67DC and with a start day that has arrived or passed;
(c) the indexed actual income stated in a notice given to the individual under section 67DD and with a start day that has arrived or passed.
No estimate
(3) If none of the estimates referred to in subsection (2) exists on the first Monday of the CCS fortnight, the Secretary must determine under subsection 67CD(8) that the individual is not entitled to be paid CCS or ACCS.

67DC Indexed estimates
(1) The Secretary may calculate an indexed estimate for an individual under subsection (5), with a start day chosen by the Secretary, if:
(a) the individual, or the individual’s partner, is a claimant for CCS by fee reduction; and
(b) a determination is in effect under paragraph 67CC(1)(a) that the claimant is eligible for CCS for a child; and
(c) information about the adjusted taxable income of the individual needed to make a determination under Division 3 for the claimant is not known; and
(d) the claimant has given the Secretary an estimate of the amount needed that the Secretary considers to be reasonable.
(2) If the Secretary calculates an indexed estimate for the individual, the Secretary may give the claimant a notice:
(a) stating the indexed estimate for the individual; and
(b) specifying the start day used in the Secretary’s calculation (which must be the first day of a CCS fortnight at least 14 days after the day the notice is given).
(3) The Secretary must not give a notice under subsection (2) stating an indexed estimate for the individual with a start day in an income year if the Secretary has already given a notice under subsection (2) stating an indexed estimate for that individual with a start day in the same income year.
(4) A notice given to a claimant under subsection (2) stating an indexed estimate for an individual has no effect if, before the start day specified in the notice for the indexed estimate, the Secretary gives the claimant a notice under subsection 67DD(2) stating an indexed actual income for the same individual. Any such notice under subsection 67DD(2) must specify a start day that is no earlier than the start day specified in the superseded notice.
(5) Calculate an indexed estimate (which may be nil) for the individual by multiplying the individual’s current ATI number (see subsection (6)) by the indexation factor, rounding the result to the nearest dollar and rounding 50 cents upwards. The indexation factor is the greater of 1 and the factor worked out to 3 decimal places as follows (increasing the factor by 0.001 if it would, if worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number greater than 4):
where:
AWE means the amount published by the Australian Statistician in a document titled “Average Weekly Earnings” under the headings “Average Weekly Earnings, Australia—Original—Persons—All employees total earnings” (or, if any of those change, in a replacement document or under replacement headings).
highest previous November means the November in which, of all the Novembers from November 2004 to the November before the most recent November (inclusive), AWE was the highest.
most recent November means the November of the income year before the income year in which the start day occurs.
reference period , in a particular November, means the period described by the Australian Statistician as the last pay period ending on or before a specified day that is the third Friday of that November.
(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the individual’s current ATI number is:
(a) if, at the time of calculation, the Secretary has given the claimant a notice under subsection 67DD(2) stating an indexed actual income for the individual with a start day that has not arrived—the indexed actual income stated in the notice; or
(b) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the individual is the claimant—the amount the Secretary is permitted to use for the individual under section 67DB (disregarding the effect for couples of section 67DE of this Act and clause 3AA of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act); or
(c) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the individual is the claimant’s partner—the amount the Secretary would be permitted to use for the individual under section 67DB if the individual were the claimant (disregarding the effect for couples of section 67DE of this Act and clause 3AA of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act).
(7) A notice under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

67DD Indexed actual incomes
(1) The Secretary may calculate an indexed actual income for an individual under subsection (4), with a start day chosen by the Secretary, if:
(a) the individual, or the individual’s partner, is a claimant for CCS by fee reduction; and
(b) a determination is in effect under paragraph 67CC(1)(a) that the claimant is eligible for CCS; and
(c) information about the adjusted taxable income of the individual needed to make a determination under Division 3 for the claimant is not known; and
(d) the most recent such determination made for the claimant was made on the basis of an indexed estimate or an indexed actual income; and
(e) since the claimant was last given a notice under subsection 67DC(2) or subsection (2) of this section stating an indexed estimate or indexed actual income for an individual, the claimant has not given the Secretary an estimate of the claimant’s adjusted taxable income that the Secretary considers to be reasonable; and
(f) the adjusted taxable income for an income year ( actual income ) of the individual (disregarding the effect for couples of clause 3AA of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act) becomes known to the Secretary and it is the most recent income year for which the individual’s actual income is known to the Secretary.
(2) If:
(a) the Secretary calculates an indexed actual income for the individual; and
(b) the indexed actual income is greater than the individual’s current ATI number (see subsection (5));
the Secretary may give the claimant a notice:
(c) stating the indexed actual income for the individual; and
(d) specifying the start day used in the Secretary’s calculation (which must be the start of a CCS fortnight at least 14 days after the day the notice is given).
(3) A notice given to a claimant under subsection (2) stating an indexed actual income for an individual has no effect if, before the start day specified in the notice, the Secretary gives the claimant another notice under that subsection or a notice under subsection 55AA(2) stating an indexed estimate or indexed actual income for the same individual. Any other such notice must specify a start day that is no earlier than the start day specified in the superseded notice.
(4) Calculate an indexed actual income (which may be nil) for the individual by multiplying the actual income of the individual which became known to the Secretary by the indexation factor, rounding the result to the nearest dollar and rounding 50 cents upwards. The indexation factor is the greater of 1 and the factor worked out to 3 decimal places as follows (increasing the factor by 0.001 if it would, if worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number greater than 4):
where:
AWE means the amount published by the Australian Statistician in a document titled “Average Weekly Earnings” under the headings “Average Weekly Earnings, Australia—Original—Persons—All employees total earnings” (or, if any of those change, in a replacement document or under replacement headings).
highest previous November means the November in which, of all the Novembers from November 2004 to the November before the most recent November (inclusive), AWE was the highest.
most recent November means the November of the income year before the income year in which the start day occurs.
reference period , in a particular November, means the period described by the Australian Statistician as the last pay period ending on or before a specified day that is the third Friday of that November.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), the individual’s current ATI number is:
(a) if, at the time of calculation, the Secretary has given the claimant a notice under subsection 67DC(2) or subsection (2) of this section stating an indexed estimate or indexed actual income for the individual with a start day that has not arrived—the indexed estimate or indexed actual income stated in the notice; or
(b) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the individual is the claimant—the amount the Secretary is permitted to use for the individual under section 67DB (disregarding the effect for couples of section 67DE of this Act and clause 3AA of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act); or
(c) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the individual is the claimant’s partner—the amount the Secretary would be permitted to use for the individual under section 67DB if the individual were the claimant (disregarding the effect for couples of section 67DE of this Act and clause 3AA of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act).
(6) A notice under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

67DE Indexed estimates and indexed actual incomes for members of couples
(1) This section applies in relation to any individual who is a member of a couple.
(2) For the purposes of this Act or the Family Assistance Act, any reference to a determination under section 67CD being made on the basis of an indexed estimate, or an indexed actual income, for an individual or stated in a notice, is affected by subsection (3).
(3) The reference is taken to be a reference to the determination being made on the basis of the indexed estimate, or the indexed actual income, for that individual or stated in that notice, combined with:
(a) the indexed estimate or indexed actual income for the individual’s partner stated in a notice given to:
(i) if the individual is the claimant for CCS or ACCS (grandparent)—the individual; or
(ii) if the individual is the partner of the claimant—the individual’s partner;
under subsection 67DC(2) or 67DD(2) with the most recent start day that has arrived or passed; or
(b) if there is no such indexed estimate or indexed actual income—a reasonable estimate of the adjusted taxable income of the individual’s partner (disregarding the effect of clause 3AA of Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act) that has been given to the Secretary by the individual.

Division 5 — Payments

67EA Simplified outline of this Division
If an individual is entitled to be paid CCS or ACCS by fee reduction for sessions of care provided to a child in a week:
(a) the Secretary pays the amount to the provider of the child care service (less a withholding amount in the case of CCS); and
(b) the provider must pass on the amount to the individual within 14 days or a longer period directed by the Secretary (whether as a fee reduction or in any other way). The provider’s obligation to pass on the amount is dealt with in section 201A.
If the individual does not receive their full entitlement in this way, the entitlement is paid directly to them, though usually not until after the CCS reconciliation conditions are met.
Approved providers who are entitled to be paid ACCS (child wellbeing), and individuals who are entitled to be paid CCS or ACCS in substitution for an individual who has died, are paid their entitlements directly.

67EB Payments to providers of individuals’ entitlements to CCS or ACCS by fee reduction
(1) If a fee reduction decision is made for an individual in relation to sessions of care provided by a child care service to a child, the Secretary must pay the fee reduction amount for the decision to the credit of a bank account nominated and maintained by the provider of the service.
Note: However, the Secretary may instead pay the fee reduction amount directly to the individual (see subsection 67EC(2)).
(2) The following table sets out the decisions that are fee reduction decisions and the amount that is the fee reduction amount for each such decision. A reference to a provider being given notice of a fee reduction decision is a reference to the provider being given notice of the decision under the provision specified for the decision in the table.

If a person is dissatisfied with a decision of a decision reviewer under Subdivision B of Division 1, the person may apply to the ART for review of the decision (an “ART review”) (certain decisions are excepted).

(c) the objection was lodged more than 52 weeks after notice of the care percentage decision referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection was given; and
(d) the decision (the review decision ) on the objection has the effect of varying the determination or substituting a new determination; and
(e) the determination as varied or substituted has effect, under sections 35T and 35U of the Family Assistance Act, as if it were a determination made under Subdivision D of Division 1 of Part 3 of that Act.
(2) The date of effect of the review decision, to the extent that it has the effect referred to in paragraph (1)(d), is:

(3) If the Secretary is satisfied that there are special circumstances that prevented the objection from being lodged within the period referred to in paragraph (1)(c), the Secretary may determine that subsection (1) applies as if the reference to 52 weeks in that paragraph were a reference to such longer period as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
