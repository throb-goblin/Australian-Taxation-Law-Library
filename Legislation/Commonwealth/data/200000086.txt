Part IIA — The general interest charge

8AAA Overview
This Part explains how to work out the general interest charge on an amount.
Usually, a person is liable to pay the charge if an amount that the person must pay to the Commissioner is not paid on time. But there are also other circumstances in which a person can be liable.
A person is only liable to pay the charge if a provision of an Act makes the person liable.

8AAB When the general interest charge applies
(1) There are certain provisions of this Act and other Acts that make persons liable to pay the general interest charge. Subsection (4) lists the provisions.
(2) A person is only liable to pay the charge on an amount if a provision specifies that the person is liable to pay the charge on the amount.
(3) The charge does not apply to the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth.
(4) The following table is an index of the laws that deal with liability to the charge.

8AAC Amount of the general interest charge
(1) The general interest charge for a day is worked out in accordance with this section.
(2) If the charge is payable under section 8AAZF on the RBA deficit at the end of that day, then the charge is worked out by multiplying the general interest charge rate for that day by the RBA deficit at the end of that day.
(3) If the charge is not payable under section 8AAZF, but applies to an amount that remains unpaid (the original unpaid amount ), then the charge is worked out by multiplying the general interest charge rate for that day by the sum of so much of the following amounts as remains unpaid:
(a) the charge from previous days;
(b) the original unpaid amount.
(4) If the charge applies to an amount that is specified in the provision that imposes the charge, but neither subsection (2) nor (3) applies, then the charge is worked out by multiplying the general interest charge rate for that day by the sum of the following amounts:
(a) so much of the charge from previous days as remains unpaid;
(b) the specified amount.

8AAD What is the general interest charge rate?
(1) The general interest charge rate for a day is the rate worked out by adding 7 percentage points to the base interest rate for that day, and dividing that total by the number of days in the calendar year.
(2) The base interest rate for a day depends on which quarter of the year the day is in. For each day in a quarter in the second column of the table, it is the monthly average yield of 90 ‑ day Bank Accepted Bills published by the Reserve Bank of Australia for the month in the third column of the table.
Base interest rate
Item
For days in this quarter...
the monthly average yield of 90 ‑ day Bank Accepted Bills for this month applies...
1 1 January to 31 Marchthe preceding November
2 1 April to 30 Junethe preceding February
3 1 July to 30 Septemberthe preceding May
4 1 October to 31 Decemberthe preceding August
(3) If the monthly average yield of 90 ‑ day Bank Accepted Bills for a particular month in the third column of the table in subsection (2) is not published by the Reserve Bank of Australia before the beginning of the relevant quarter, assume that it is the same as the last monthly average yield of 90 ‑ day Bank Accepted Bills published by the Reserve Bank of Australia before that month.
(4) The base interest rate must be rounded to the second decimal place (rounding .005 upwards).

8AAE When the charge is due and payable
The general interest charge for a day is due and payable to the Commissioner at the end of that day.
Note: For provisions about collection and recovery of the charge, see Part 4 ‑ 15 in Schedule 1.

8AAF Notification by Commissioner
(1) The Commissioner may give notice to a person liable to pay the charge of the amount of the charge for a particular day or days.
(4) A notice given to a person by the Commissioner under this section is prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the notice.

8AAG Remission of the charge
(1) The Commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge payable by a person.
(2) However, if a person is liable to pay the charge because an amount remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, the Commissioner may only remit all or a part of the charge in the circumstances set out in subsection (3), (4) or (5).
(3) The Commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the Commissioner is satisfied that:
(a) the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were not due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person; and
(b) the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances.
(4) The Commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the Commissioner is satisfied that:
(a) the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person; and
(b) the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances; and
(c) having regard to the nature of those circumstances, it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge.
(5) The Commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the Commissioner is satisfied that:
(a) there are special circumstances because of which it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge; or
(b) it is otherwise appropriate to do so.

8AAGA Rounding of the charge
If the amount of the charge payable for any period is not a multiple of 5 cents, the Commissioner may round it down to the nearest multiple of 5 cents.

8AAH Judgment for payment of an unpaid amount
(1) This section applies if judgment is given by, or entered in, a court for the payment of:
(a) all or a part of an amount in respect of which a person is, or was, liable to pay the charge because the amount remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid; or
(b) an amount that includes all or a part of the unpaid amount.
(2) The consequences of judgment being given or entered are:
(a) the unpaid amount is not taken, for the purposes of a provision that makes, or would make, the person liable to pay the charge on the unpaid amount, to have ceased to be due and payable by reason only of the giving or entering of the judgment; and
(b) if the judgment debt carries interest, the amount of the charge that the person would, if not for this paragraph, be liable to pay on the unpaid amount is reduced by:
(i) in a case to which paragraph (1)(a) applies—the amount of the interest; or
(ii) in a case to which paragraph (1)(b) applies—the amount worked out using the formula:

Division 3 — Treatment of payments, credits and RBA surpluses

8AAZL Amounts covered by this Division
(1) This Division sets out how the Commissioner must treat the following kinds of amount:
(a) a payment the Commissioner receives in respect of a current or anticipated tax debt or tax debts of an entity;
(b) a credit (including an excess non ‑ RBA credit) that an entity is entitled to under a taxation law;
(c) an RBA surplus of an entity.
(2) The Commissioner must treat each such amount using the method set out in section 8AAZLA or 8AAZLB (but not both).
Note: In either case, section 8AAZLC has some additional rules that apply to RBA surpluses and to certain excess non ‑ RBA credits.
(3) However, the Commissioner does not have to treat an amount using either of those methods if doing so would require the Commissioner to apply the amount against a tax debt:
(a) that is due but not yet payable; or
(b) in respect of which the taxpayer has complied with an arrangement under section 255 ‑ 15 to pay the debt by instalments; or
(c) in respect of which the Commissioner has agreed to defer recovery under section 255 ‑ 5.
(4) Furthermore, the Commissioner does not have to treat an amount using either of those methods if:
(a) doing so would require the Commissioner to apply the amount against a tax debt; and
(b) the tax debt is a penalty that is due and payable under section 269 ‑ 20 in Schedule 1 (penalties for directors of non ‑ complying companies).

8AAZLA Method 1—allocating the amount first to an RBA
(1) The Commissioner may, in the manner he or she determines, allocate the amount to an RBA of the entity or, if the entity is a member of an RBA group, to an RBA of another member of the group.
(2) The Commissioner must then also apply the amount against the following kinds of debts (if there are any):
(a) tax debts that have been allocated to that RBA;
(b) general interest charge on such tax debts.
(3) To the extent that the amount is not applied under subsection (2), it gives rise to an excess non ‑ RBA credit in favour of the entity that:
(a) is equal to the part of the amount that is not applied; and
(b) relates to the RBA to which the amount was allocated.

8AAZLB Method 2—applying the amount first against a non ‑ RBA tax debt
(1) The Commissioner may, in the manner he or she determines, apply the amount against a non ‑ RBA tax debt of the entity or, if the entity is a member of an RBA group, against a non ‑ RBA tax debt of another member of the group.
(2) If the non ‑ RBA tax debt is:
(a) a tax debt that has been allocated to an RBA; or
(b) general interest charge on such a tax debt;
the Commissioner must then also allocate the amount to that RBA.
(3) To the extent that the amount is not applied under subsection (1), it gives rise to an excess non ‑ RBA credit in favour of the entity that is equal to the part of the amount that is not applied.
(4) The excess non ‑ RBA credit relates to the RBA (if any) that the Commissioner determines and the balance of that RBA is adjusted in the entity’s favour by the amount of that credit.
Separate RBAs for one entity
(5) If the non ‑ RBA tax debt mentioned in subsection (1) has been allocated to 2 or more RBAs, the Commissioner must allocate the amount applied between those RBAs in the proportions in which the tax debt was allocated.
Note: Separate RBAs may be established for different businesses or undertakings conducted by the same entity, for different parts of the same business or undertaking or for different periods: see subsection 8AAZC(5).

8AAZLC RBA surplus and related credits must remain equivalent if one or the other is applied
RBA surpluses
(1) If an RBA surplus is allocated or applied under this Division, the Commissioner must reduce by the same amount excess non ‑ RBA credits that relate to the RBA.
Excess non ‑ RBA credits
(2) If, under this Division, an excess non ‑ RBA credit that relates to an RBA (the related RBA ) is:
(a) allocated to an RBA; or
(b) applied against a non ‑ RBA tax debt;
the related RBA is adjusted in the Commissioner’s favour by the same amount.

8AAZLD Special priority credits
If, under this Division, the Commissioner is to apply a credit that arises under Schedule 1 to this Act (the PAYG system), the Commissioner must apply it, whether under section 8AAZLA or 8AAZLB:
(aa) first, against any compulsory repayment amount of the entity; and
(aaa) then against any compulsory VETSL repayment amount of the entity; and
(ab) then against any compulsory SSL repayment amount of the entity; and
(ac) then against any compulsory ABSTUDY SSL repayment amount of the entity; and
(ad) then against any compulsory AASL repayment amount of the entity; and
(b) then against any FS assessment debt of the entity;
before applying it against other non ‑ RBA tax debts of the entity.

8AAZLE Instructions to Commissioner not binding
In doing anything under this Division, the Commissioner is not required to take account of any instructions of any entity.

Division 3A — Refunds of RBA surpluses and credits

8AAZLF Commissioner must refund RBA surpluses and credits
(1) The Commissioner must refund to an entity so much of:
(a) an RBA surplus of the entity; or
(b) a credit (including an excess non ‑ RBA credit) in the entity’s favour;
as the Commissioner does not allocate or apply under Division 3.
Voluntary payments only to be refunded on request
(2) However, the Commissioner is not required to refund an RBA surplus or excess non ‑ RBA credit that arises because a payment is made in respect of an anticipated tax debt of an entity unless the entity later requests, in the approved manner, that the Commissioner do so.
(3) On receiving such a request, the Commissioner must refund so much of the amount as the Commissioner does not allocate or apply under Division 3.
Effect of refunding RBA surplus
(4) If the Commissioner refunds an RBA surplus under this section, the Commissioner must reduce by the same amount excess non ‑ RBA credits that relate to the RBA.
Effect of refunding credit that relates to an RBA
(5) If, under this section, the Commissioner refunds an excess non ‑ RBA credit that relates to an RBA, the RBA is adjusted in the Commissioner’s favour by the same amount.

8AAZLG Retaining refunds until information or notification given

is to be in private if the party who made the application requests that it be in private.

14ZZF Giving documents to the ART
(1) Section 23 (decision ‑ maker must give Tribunal reasons and documents—general rule) of the ART Act does not apply in relation to an application for review of a reviewable objection decision.

(b) the notice of the taxation decision concerned;
(c) the taxation objection concerned;
(d) the notice of the objection decision;

(3) Section 25 (decision ‑ maker must give Tribunal additional documents within 28 days—general rule) of the ART Act does not apply in relation to the ART’s review of a reviewable objection decision.

(6) To avoid doubt, the ART’s power in subsection (5) of this section is in addition to the ART’s power in section 26 (decision ‑ maker must give Tribunal additional documents on request—general rule) of the ART Act.
(7) For the purposes of the ART Act:
(a) the requirement to give a statement giving the reasons for the decision under paragraph (2)(a) of this section is taken to be the requirement to give a statement of reasons for the decision under paragraph 23(a) of that Act; and

(b) the party requesting the order is not the Commissioner of Taxation.
(2) Despite the ART Act, the ART must not make the order unless the party satisfies the ART that, when considered in the context of both the particular circumstances of the decision under review and the overall taxation system, the application for review and the request for making the order are not frivolous, vexatious, misconceived, lacking in substance or otherwise intended to unduly impede, prejudice or restrict the proper administration or operation of a taxation law.

14ZZM Pending review not to affect implementation of taxation decisions

Division 6 — Guide to Parts 2 ‑ 5 and 2 ‑ 10

6 ‑ 1 What Parts 2 ‑ 5 and 2 ‑ 10 are about
To help taxpayers meet their annual income tax liability, they are required to pay amounts of their income at regular intervals as it is earned during the year. The system for collecting these amounts is called “Pay as you go”.
Amounts collected under this system also go towards meeting liability for Medicare levy and liability to repay debts under certain income ‑ contingent loan schemes.
Table of sections

6 ‑ 5 The Pay as you go (PAYG) system

6 ‑ 10 How the amounts collected are dealt with

6 ‑ 5 The Pay as you go (PAYG) system
(1) Parts 2 ‑ 5 and 2 ‑ 10 establish the PAYG system, which has 2 components:
• PAYG withholding (Part 2 ‑ 5)
• PAYG instalments (Part 2 ‑ 10).
PAYG withholding
(2) Under PAYG withholding, amounts are collected in respect of particular kinds of payments or transactions. Usually, someone who makes a payment to you is required to withhold an amount from the payment, and then to pay the amount to the Commissioner.
For a list of the payments and other transactions to which PAYG withholding applies, see Division 10
PAYG instalments
(3) You pay PAYG instalments directly to the Commissioner. These are usually based on your GDP ‑ adjusted notional tax or your ordinary income for a past period, but excluding:
• income subject to PAYG withholding (with certain exceptions)
• exempt income, or income that is otherwise not assessable.
An instalment is usually paid after a quarter, but some taxpayers are eligible to pay an annual instalment after the end of the income year.

6 ‑ 10 How the amounts collected are dealt with
You are entitled to credits for the amounts of your income that are collected under the PAYG system. The credits are applied under Division 3 of Part IIB against your tax debts, and any excess is refunded to you.

Part 2 ‑ 5 — Pay as you go (PAYG) withholding

Division 10 — Guide to Part 2 ‑ 5

10 ‑ 1 What this Part is about
Under PAYG withholding, amounts are collected in respect of particular kinds of payments or transactions. Usually, someone who makes a payment to you is required to withhold an amount from the payment, and then to pay the amount to the Commissioner. If the payment is personal services income that is included in the assessable income of someone else under Division 86 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 , the payer must pay such an amount to the Commissioner at a later date.
If a non ‑ cash benefit is provided instead of a payment, the provider must first pay to the Commissioner the amount that would have been withheld from the payment.
This Part also contains provisions about the obligations and rights of payers and recipients.

10 ‑ 5 Summary of withholding payments
(1) The payments and other transactions covered by PAYG withholding are called withholding payments. They are summarised in the table.
Note: The obligation to pay an amount to the Commissioner is imposed on the entity making the withholding payment (except for items 17, 19, 22 and 27, and 26 (to the extent that it covers subsection 12 ‑ 390(4))).

Subdivision 12 ‑ H — Distributions of withholding MIT income

Guide to Subdivision 12 ‑ H

12 ‑ 375 What this Subdivision is about
A withholding MIT may be required to withhold an amount from a payment of its Australian sourced net income (other than dividends, interest and royalties) if the payment is made to an entity whose address, or place for payment, is outside Australia. If the payment is made to another entity, the withholding MIT is required to make information available to the recipient outlining certain details in relation to the payment.
If a custodian receives a payment that is covered by that information, it is required to withhold an amount from any related later payment to an entity whose address, or place for payment, is outside Australia. If the later payment is made to another entity, the custodian is required to make information available in relation to that later payment.
If an entity that is not a custodian receives a payment that is covered by that information, it is required to withhold an amount from that payment if a foreign resident becomes entitled to that payment. If a resident becomes entitled to the payment, the entity must make information available in relation to that payment.
Where there is an obligation to withhold, the applicable withholding rate is determined by the nature of the country or territory in which the recipient’s address, place for payment or residency is located and whether the trust is a clean building managed investment trust.
A managed investment trust is a clean building managed investment trust if it is a managed investment trust that holds one or more clean buildings and does not derive assessable income from any other taxable Australian property (other than certain assets that are reasonably incidental to a clean building).

12 ‑ 405 Meaning of fund payment —general case
(1) The object of this section is to ensure that the total of the * fund payments that the trustee of a trust makes in relation to an income year equals, as nearly as practicable, the net income of the trust for the income year, disregarding these amounts ( excluded amounts ):
(a) a dividend (as defined in Division 11A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ) that is subject to, or exempted from, a requirement to withhold under Subdivision 12 ‑ F;
(b) interest (as so defined) that is subject to, or exempted from, such a requirement;
(c) a * royalty that is subject to, or exempted from, such a requirement;
(d) a * capital gain or * capital loss from a * CGT event that happens in relation to a * CGT asset that is not * taxable Australian property;
(e) amounts that are not from an * Australian source;
and disregarding deductions relating to excluded amounts.
(1A) This section applies to a trust that is not an * AMIT for an income year.
Note: For the definition of fund payment in respect of a trust that is an AMIT for an income year, see section 12A ‑ 110.
(2) Work out as follows how much of a payment (the actual payment ) made by the trustee of a trust in relation to an income year is a fund payment in relation to that year:
Method statement
Step 1. Reduce the actual payment by so much of it that is attributable to excluded amounts, and increase it by any amounts to which subsection (2A) or (2B) applies for the income year (except to the extent that capital gains against which those amounts are applied are included in the actual payment made in relation to the income year).
Step 2. Work out what it is reasonable to expect will be the *net income of the trust for the income year:
(aa) increasing the net income by any amounts to which subsection (2A) or (2B) applies for the income year; and
(a) disregarding (except to the extent that they are amounts to which subsection (2A) or (2B) applies for the income year) excluded amounts, expected excluded amounts and deductions relating to those amounts; and
(b) on the basis that a *capital gain from *taxable Australian property of the trust that was or would be reduced under step 3 of the method statement in subsection 102 ‑ 5(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 were double the amount it actually is.
Step 3. The fund payment is so much of the step 2 amount as is reasonable having regard to:
(a) the object of this section; and
(b) the step 1 amount; and
(c) the amounts of any earlier fund payments made by the trustee in relation to the income year; and
(d) the expected amounts of any later fund payments the trustee expects to make in relation to the income year.
(2A) If:
(a) during an income year, a * capital loss from a * CGT event happens in relation to a * CGT asset that is not * taxable Australian property; and
(b) in relation to that income year, some or all of the capital loss is applied against a * capital gain from a CGT event that happens in relation to a CGT asset that is taxable Australian property;
this subsection applies, for that income year, to the amount that is so applied.
(2B) If:
(a) the trust has a * net capital loss for an income year; and
(b) one or more of the * capital losses the trust made during that income year were from * CGT events that happened in relation to * CGT assets that were not * taxable Australian property; and
(c) in relation to a later income year, some or all of the net capital loss is applied against a * capital gain from a CGT event that happens in relation to a CGT asset that is taxable Australian property;
this subsection applies, for the later income year, to an amount equal to so much of the net capital loss that is so applied as related to capital losses mentioned in paragraph (b).
(3) The expected * net income of the trust and the expected amounts of future * fund payments are to be worked out on the basis of the trustee’s knowledge when the actual payment is made.
(4) However, an amount is not a fund payment in relation to the income year unless it is paid:
(a) during the income year; or
(b) within 3 months after the end of the income year; or
(c) within a longer period (starting at the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b) and not exceeding 3 months) allowed by the Commissioner.
(5) The Commissioner may allow a longer period as mentioned in paragraph (4)(c) only if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the trustee was unable to make the payment during the income year, or within 3 months after the end of the income year, because of circumstances beyond the influence or control of the trustee.

12 ‑ 410 Entity to whom payment is made
(1) An entity (the recipient ) is covered by this section for a payment made to it by another entity (the payer ) if:
(a) according to any record that is in the payer’s possession, or is kept or maintained on the payer’s behalf, the recipient has an address outside Australia; or
(b) the payer is authorised to make the payment to a place outside Australia.
(2) However, a recipient is not covered by this section for a payment if, at the time the payment was made, a * business the recipient carries on is carried on at or through an * Australian permanent establishment and the payment is attributable to that establishment.

12 ‑ 415 Failure to give notice or make information available: administrative penalty
An entity that:
(a) is required to give a notice, or make details available on a website, under section 12 ‑ 395 in relation to:
(i) a payment made to another entity; or
(ii) an amount paid or credited to, or dealt with on behalf of or as directed by, another entity; and
(b) fails to comply with that section;

(b) another payment made by the first entity to the extent that it is reasonably attributable to the first payment.
(2) This Subdivision has effect as if the first entity were not an * agent in relation to the payments.

12A ‑ 110 Meaning of fund payment —AMITs
(1) This section applies to a trust that is an * AMIT for an income year.
(2) The object of this section is to ensure that the total of the * fund payments that the trustee of the * AMIT makes in relation to the income year equals, as nearly as practicable, the amount mentioned in subsection (3).
(3) The amount is the sum of the following amounts:
(a) total of the * determined member components for the * AMIT for the income year of a character relating to assessable income, disregarding determined member components (the excluded components ) of any of the following characters:
(i) the character of a * discount capital gain from a * CGT asset that is not * taxable Australian property;
(ii) the character of a * capital gain (other than a discount capital gain) from a CGT asset that is not taxable Australian property;
(iii) the character of a dividend (as defined in Division 11A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ) that is subject to, or exempted from, a requirement to withhold under Subdivision 12 ‑ F;
(iv) the character of interest (as defined in Division 11A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ) that is subject to, or exempted from, a requirement to withhold under Subdivision 12 ‑ F;

(b) the total of each * capital loss of the AMIT from a * CGT event that:
(i) happened in the income year to a CGT asset that is not taxable Australian property; and
(ii) has been applied against a capital gain from a CGT event that happened in relation to a CGT asset that is taxable Australian property;
but only to the extent that each such capital loss has been so applied in the income year;
(c) the total of each amount to which subsection (3A) applies in relation to the income year.
(3A) If:
(a) the AMIT has a * net capital loss for an earlier income year; and
(b) one or more of the * capital losses the trust made during that earlier income year were from * CGT events that happened in relation to * CGT assets that were not * taxable Australian property; and
(c) in relation to the income year mentioned in paragraph (3)(c), some or all of the net capital loss is applied against a * capital gain from a CGT event that happens in relation to a CGT asset that is taxable Australian property;
this subsection applies, for the income year mentioned in paragraph (3)(c), to an amount equal to so much of the net capital loss that is so applied as related to capital losses mentioned in paragraph (b) of this subsection.
(4) The Commissioner may, by legislative instrument, specify one or more characters for the purposes of subparagraph (3)(a)(vii).
(5) A payment (the actual or deemed payment ) that the trustee of a trust makes in relation to an income year is a fund payment in relation to that year. However, the amount of the fund payment is worked out under the following method statement, and may be:
(a) the amount of the actual or deemed payment; or
(b) the amount of the actual or deemed payment, increased or reduced as a result of the method statement.
Note: The payment by the trustee may be an actual payment, or a deemed payment under section 12A ‑ 205.
Method statement
Step 1. Reduce the actual or deemed payment by so much of it that is attributable to the excluded components.
Step 2. Work out what it is reasonable to expect will be the amount mentioned in subsection (3).
Do so on the basis that a * capital gain from * taxable Australian property of the trust that was or would be reduced under step 3 of the method statement in subsection 102 ‑ 5(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 were double the amount it actually is.
Step 3. The fund payment is so much of the step 2 amount as is reasonable having regard to:
(a) the object of this section; and
(b) the step 1 amount; and
(c) the amounts of any earlier fund payments made by the trustee in relation to the income year; and
(d) the expected amounts of any later fund payments the trustee expects to make in relation to the income year.
(6) The amount mentioned in subsection (3) and the expected amounts of any later * fund payments are to be worked out on the basis of the trustee’s knowledge when the payment is made.
(7) Subsection (6) does not apply if the payment is a payment arising because of the operation of section 12A ‑ 205 (deemed payments).
(8) However, the payment is not a fund payment in relation to the income year if:
(a) the payment (the actual payment ) is a * post ‑ AMMA actual payment in respect of another payment; and
(b) the other payment arises because of the operation of section 12A ‑ 205; and
(c) the other payment is a fund payment.
(9) An amount is also not a fund payment in relation to the income year unless it is paid:
(a) during the income year; or
(b) within 3 months after the end of the income year; or
(c) within a longer period (starting at the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b) and not exceeding 3 years) allowed by the Commissioner.
(10) The Commissioner may allow a longer period as mentioned in paragraph (9)(c) only if the Commissioner is of the opinion that:
(a) if the other payment arises at a time because of the operation of section 12A ‑ 205 (deemed payments)—the * AMIT complied with subsection 276 ‑ 455(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in respect of the income year (requirement to give AMMA statements within 3 months); or
(b) otherwise—the trustee was unable to make the payment during the income year, or within 3 months after the end of the income year, because of circumstances beyond the influence or control of the trustee.

Subdivision 12A ‑ C — Deemed payments by AMITs etc.

Guide to Subdivision 12A ‑ C

12A ‑ 200 What this Subdivision is about
When a withholding MIT that is an AMIT gives a member an AMMA statement, the trustee is deemed to have made a payment to the member.
The payment is generally the sum of the determined member components reflected in the statement that are of a character relating to assessable income, reduced by any previous actual payments related to those components.
The deemed payment can flow through one or more custodians, giving rise to subsequent deemed payments.

(c) the AMIT gives the first recipient an * AMMA statement for the income year.
(2) For the purposes of this Part, Subdivision 840 ‑ M of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and Division 11A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 :
(a) treat the trustee of the * AMIT as having made a payment (the first deemed payment ) of an amount to the first recipient at the time the AMIT gave the first recipient the * AMMA statement; and
(b) treat the amount of the first deemed payment as being the amount worked out as follows:
(i) first, work out the total of all the * determined member components of all the * members of the AMIT of a character relating to assessable income for the income year;
(ii) next, identify each of the * pre ‑ AMMA actual payments (if any) made to those members in respect of all payments by the trustee to those members that arise from the operation of paragraph (a);
(iii) next, identify every * AMIT DIR payment (if any) and each * fund payment (if any) that arises from each such pre ‑ AMMA actual payment;
(iv) next, reduce the result of subparagraph (i) by the sum of each such AMIT DIR payment and fund payment;
(v) next, work out how much of the result of subparagraph (iv) is referable to the first recipient.
(3) Also, for the purposes of Division 11A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 , treat the first recipient as having derived the first deemed payment just before the end of the income year to which the * AMMA statement relates.
(4) Subsection (5) applies if:
(a) the first recipient is a * custodian; and
(b) another entity (the subsequent recipient ):
(i) starts to have, at a time, an entitlement to an amount that is reasonably attributable to all or part of the first deemed payment; or
(ii) would start to have, at a time, such an entitlement if the first deemed payment were an actual payment of an amount.
(5) For the purposes of this Part, Subdivision 840 ‑ M of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and Division 11A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 :
(a) treat the first recipient as having made a payment (the subsequent deemed payment ) of an amount to the subsequent recipient at that time; and

(6) Also, for the purposes of Division 11A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 , treat the subsequent recipient as having derived the subsequent deemed payment at the time the subsequent deemed payment arises.
(7) If:
(a) an entity is a subsequent recipient mentioned in subsection (4) (including as a result of a previous operation of this subsection); and
(b) subsection (5) applies with the result that a payment is treated as having been made to the entity; and
(c) the entity is a * custodian;
apply subsections (4), (5) and (6) again as if the entity were the first recipient mentioned in subsection (4).
Note: This means that the entity is treated under subsection (5) as having made a payment to another entity if the other entity has (or would have) an entitlement as mentioned in paragraph (4)(b).

12A ‑ 210 Post ‑ AMMA actual payment and pre ‑ AMMA actual payment in respect of deemed payment

Division 13 — Alienated personal services payments

Table of sections

13 ‑ 1 Object of this Division

13 ‑ 5 Payment to the Commissioner in respect of alienated personal services payments

13 ‑ 10 Alienated personal services payments

13 ‑ 15 Personal services payment remitters

13 ‑ 20 Time for payments to Commissioner for alienated personal services payments made during 2000 ‑ 01

13 ‑ 1 Object of this Division
The object of this Division is to ensure the efficient collection of income tax (and other liabilities) on any * personal services income included in an individual’s assessable income under Division 86 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 by:
(a) putting * personal services entities receiving * alienated personal services payments in a position similar to their position if amounts were withheld from the payments under Division 12; but
(b) doing so in a way that enables them to comply with their obligations without having to withhold amounts separately from each payment.
Note: Under Division 86 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (about alienation of personal services income), an individual’s personal services income that is gained or produced by another entity is in some cases included in the individual’s assessable income. Payments of this income by the entity might not be caught by Division 12.

13 ‑ 5 Payment to the Commissioner in respect of alienated personal services payments
Obligation to pay amounts
(1) A * personal services entity must pay an amount of tax to the Commissioner if:
(a) it receives an * alienated personal services payment that relates to an individual’s personal services income; and
(b) it receives the payment during a * PAYG payment period for which it is a * personal services payment remitter.
Working out the amounts
(2) Use this method statement to work out the amount:
Method statement
Step 1. Identify the payments that the * personal services entity makes to the individual during the period mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) that are * withholding payments covered by section 12 ‑ 35.
Step 2. Identify the amounts that:
(a) are included in the individual’s assessable income under section 86 ‑ 15 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ; and
(b) relate to * alienated personal services payments the entity receives during that period.
Step 3. Work out the sum of all the amounts that Division 12 would require the entity to withhold in respect of that period if both of these were taken into account:
(a) the payments identified in step 1; and
(b) the amounts identified in step 2, as if they were payments of salary covered by section 12 ‑ 35.
Step 4. Work out the sum of all the amounts withheld under section 12 ‑ 35 from the payments identified in step 1.
Step 5. Subtract the sum under step 4 from the sum under step 3.
Example: For the PAYG payment period of 1 April 2001 to 30 June 2001, NewIT Pty. Ltd. received amounts totalling $18,000 that were Ron’s personal services income. NewIT does not conduct a personal services business.
During the period, NewIT paid Ron $3,000 in salary. This is a withholding payment covered by section 12 ‑ 35 (step 1).
$15,000 of the amount NewIT received is included in Ron’s assessable income under section 86 ‑ 15 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (step 2).
If NewIT had paid the $15,000 in salary to Ron within 14 days after the end of the PAYG payment period, the amount that NewIT would have had to withhold under Division 12 on the total amount of $18,000 would have been $4,000 (step 3).
NewIT withheld $500 from the salary payment of $3,000, as required by section 12 ‑ 35 (step 4).
On the basis of these facts, the amount NewIT must pay to the Commissioner (step 5) is:
(3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), the * personal services entity must pay the amount to the Commissioner by the end of the 21st day after the end of the * PAYG payment period.
Note: A different rule applies for alienated personal services payments that large withholders and medium withholders make during the 2000 ‑ 01 income year. See section 13 ‑ 20.
(4) If:
(a) the * personal services entity is a * deferred BAS payer on the 21st day after the end of the * PAYG payment period; and
(b) the personal services entity’s PAYG payment period is a * quarter;
the entity must pay that amount to the Commissioner as shown in the table:
Payments by * deferred BAS payers
Item
If paragraph (4)(a) applies to the * quarter ending on:
the amount for this quarter must be paid by the end of:
1 30 Septemberthe following 28 October
2 31 Decemberthe following 28 February
3 31 Marchthe following 28 April
4 30 Junethe following 28 July
(5) If:
(a) the * personal services entity is a * deferred BAS payer on the 21st day after the end of the * PAYG payment period; and
(b) the personal services entity’s PAYG payment period is a month;
the entity must pay that amount to the Commissioner:
(c) by the end of the 28th day of the month following that period unless the PAYG payment period is a December; or
(d) by the end of the 28th day of the next February if the PAYG payment period is a December.

13 ‑ 10 Alienated personal services payments
An alienated personal services payment is a payment (including a payment in the form of a * non ‑ cash benefit) that a * personal services entity receives and that relates to an amount that:
(a) is included in an individual’s assessable income under Division 86 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ; or
(b) would be so included but for the fact that the entity received the income in the course of conducting a * personal services business.
For valuation of non ‑ cash benefits, see sections 21 and 21A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 .

13 ‑ 15 Personal services payment remitters
General
(1) A * personal services entity is a personal services payment remitter for a * PAYG payment period if, in the income year preceding that period:
(a) the entity’s * ordinary income or * statutory income included a person’s * personal services income; and
(b) the entity was not conducting a * personal services business.
Businesses not previously receiving personal services income
(2) A * personal services entity is a personal services payment remitter for a * PAYG payment period if:
(a) the entity’s * ordinary income or * statutory income did not include an individual’s * personal services income in any income year preceding that period; and
(b) it is reasonable to expect that, in the income year during which the period occurs, the entity’s income will include a person’s * personal services income that the entity will not have received in the course of conducting a * personal services business.
(3) It is not reasonable to expect that the * personal services entity will receive a person’s * personal services income in the course of conducting a * personal services business if it is reasonable to expect that:
(a) the entity will receive at least 80% of that income from the same entity (or one entity and its * associates); and
(b) the entity will not meet the results test under section 87 ‑ 18 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 .

14 ‑ 75 Overpayment of TFN withholding tax

14 ‑ 85 Other laws do not exempt from TFN withholding tax

Subdivision 14 ‑ A — Non ‑ cash benefits

14 ‑ 1 Object of this Subdivision
The object of this Subdivision is:
(a) to put entities that provide * non ‑ cash benefits, and entities that receive them, in a position similar to their position under Division 12 if payments of money had been made instead of the non ‑ cash benefits being provided; and
(b) in that way, to prevent entities from avoiding their obligations under Division 12 by providing non ‑ cash benefits.

14 ‑ 5 Provider of non ‑ cash benefit must pay amount to the Commissioner if payment would be subject to withholding
(1) An entity (the payer ) must pay an amount to the Commissioner before providing a * non ‑ cash benefit to another entity (the recipient ) if Division 12 would require the payer to withhold an amount (the notionally withheld amount ) if, instead of providing the benefit to the recipient, the payer made a payment to the recipient in money equal to the * market value of the benefit when the benefit is provided.
(2) The amount to be paid to the Commissioner is equal to the notionally withheld amount.
Example: Nick is a building contractor who has entered into a voluntary agreement with Mike for the purposes of section 12 ‑ 55. Nick proposes to give Mike his old utility van (whose market value is $1,000) as payment for work Mike has done for him over a fortnight.
If Nick were instead to pay Mike $1,000, Nick would have had to withhold $203 under Division 12 (in accordance with withholding rates current at the time).
This section requires Nick to pay $203 to the Commissioner before giving the van to Mike.
(3) This section does not apply to providing:
(a) a * fringe benefit; or
(b) a benefit that is an exempt benefit under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 ; or
(c) a benefit that would be an exempt benefit under that Act if paragraphs (d) and (e) of the definition of employer in subsection 136(1) of that Act were omitted; or
(d) a benefit constituted by the acquisition of an * ESS interest * under an employee share scheme to which Subdivision 83A ‑ B or 83A ‑ C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 applies.

14 ‑ 10 Dividend, interest or royalty received, for a foreign resident, in the form of a non ‑ cash benefit
If:
(a) an entity (the payer ) receives in the form of a * non ‑ cash benefit:
(i) a * dividend of a company; or
(ii) interest (within the meaning of Division 11A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ); or
(iii) a * royalty; and
(b) section 12 ‑ 215, 12 ‑ 250 or 12 ‑ 285 would have required the payer to withhold an amount if the dividend, interest or royalty had been a payment in money;
the payer must pay that amount to the Commissioner before providing the benefit (or part of it) to another entity.

14 ‑ 15 Payer can recover amount paid to the Commissioner
(1) The payer may recover from the recipient as a debt an amount that the payer has paid to the Commissioner under section 14 ‑ 5.
(2) If the payer has paid an amount to the Commissioner under section 14 ‑ 10, the payer may:
(a) if the payer has provided all of the benefit to another entity—recover the amount from that other entity as a debt; or
(b) if the payer has provided a part of the benefit to another entity—recover from that other entity as a debt the corresponding proportion of the amount paid to the Commissioner.
(3) If the payer can recover an amount from another entity under this section, the payer is entitled to set the amount off against debts due by the payer to the other entity.

Subdivision 14 ‑ B — Accruing gains

14 ‑ 50 Object of this Subdivision
The object of this Subdivision is to put the parties to a * Part VA investment with an accruing gain in a position similar to what would have been their position under Subdivision 12 ‑ E (Payments where TFN or ABN not quoted) if the * investment body had paid the gain in money to the * investor at the end of the income year.

14 ‑ 55 Liability for TFN withholding tax
(1) * TFN withholding tax is payable if:
(a) in relation to a * Part VA investment, an amount (the accrued gain ) is included in the * investor’s assessable income for an income year under section 159GQ of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (about gains accruing on securities); and
(b) the investment:
(i) is of a kind mentioned in item 1 or 2 of the table in subsection 202D(1) of that Act; or
(ii) is of a kind mentioned in item 3 of that table and is non ‑ transferable; and
(c) the term of the investment does not end during the income year; and
(d) section 12 ‑ 140 would have required the * investment body to withhold an amount (the TFN withholding amount ) from a payment of the accrued gain to the investor, if the investment body had made the payment at the end of the income year and section 12 ‑ 150 had not been enacted.
Note: Section 202D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 lists the investments in connection with which tax file numbers are to be quoted.
(2) The amount of * TFN withholding tax is equal to the TFN withholding amount.
(3) The * TFN withholding tax is payable jointly and severally by the * investor and the * investment body.
(4) However, if the * investment body is the Commonwealth or an * untaxable Commonwealth entity:
(a) the * TFN withholding tax is payable by the * investor; and
(b) the investor is taken to have authorised the investment body to pay the TFN withholding tax on the investor’s behalf.
(5) The * TFN withholding tax is due and payable at the end of 21 days after the end of the income year referred to in paragraph (1)(a).
Note 1: When it is due and payable, the TFN withholding tax is payable to the Commissioner: see paragraph 255 ‑ 5(1)(b).
Note 2: An entity by whom it is payable must pay it to the Commissioner in accordance with Subdivision 16 ‑ B: see subsection 16 ‑ 70(3). If any of it remains unpaid, the entity is liable to pay general interest charge: see section 16 ‑ 80.
Note 3: The Commissioner may defer the time at which TFN withholding tax becomes due and payable: see section 255 ‑ 10.
(6) The adoption (under section 18 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ) of an accounting period ending on a day other than 30 June is disregarded for the purposes of:
(a) this section; and
(b) the application of Division 16E of Part III of that Act for the purposes of this section.

14 ‑ 60 Investment body may recover TFN withholding tax from investor
(1) The * investment body may recover from the * investor as a debt any of the * TFN withholding tax that it pays.
(2) The * investment body is entitled to set off an amount that it can recover from the * investor under this section against:
(a) a debt due by it to the investor; or
(b) an amount that is accruing to the investor, or stands to the investor’s credit, in respect of the * Part VA investment, even if the amount is not yet due.

14 ‑ 65 Application of rules in Division 18
These provisions:
(a) subsection 18 ‑ 15(1) and sections 18 ‑ 20 and 18 ‑ 25 (about credits for amounts withheld from withholding payments); and
(b) section 18 ‑ 80 (about refunds when exemption declaration not given);
apply as if any of the * TFN withholding tax that has been paid were an amount withheld under subsection 12 ‑ 140(1) from a * withholding payment covered by that subsection and made to the * investor during:
(c) unless the * investor has adopted (under section 18 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ) an accounting period ending on a day other than 30 June—the income year referred to in paragraph 14 ‑ 55(1)(a); or
(d) if the investor has adopted such an accounting period—the income year in which the TFN withholding tax is paid.
Note: Unless the investor has adopted such an accounting period, the credit under section 18 ‑ 15, 18 ‑ 20 or 18 ‑ 25 will be in respect of the income year before the one in which the TFN withholding tax is paid.

14 ‑ 75 Overpayment of TFN withholding tax
If * TFN withholding tax has been overpaid:
(a) the Commissioner must refund the amount overpaid; and
(b) the * investor is not entitled to a credit under section 18 ‑ 15, 18 ‑ 20 or 18 ‑ 25 in respect of the amount overpaid.

14 ‑ 85 Other laws do not exempt from TFN withholding tax
(1) A provision of a law passed before the commencement of this section that purports to exempt an entity from liability to pay * TFN withholding tax, or to pay taxes that include TFN withholding tax, does not exempt that entity from liability to pay TFN withholding tax.
(2) A provision of a law passed at or after the commencement of this section that purports to exempt an entity from liability to pay taxes under the laws of the Commonwealth, or to pay certain taxes under those laws that include * TFN withholding tax, is not to be interpreted as exempting the entity from liability to pay TFN withholding tax, unless it specifically mentions TFN withholding tax.

When the amount must be paid
(4) You must pay the amount on or before:
(a) the day on which:
(i) any of the * consideration for the * supply (other than consideration provided as a deposit) is first provided; or
(ii) if the supplier is your * associate, and the supply is without consideration—the supply is made; or
(b) if a determination under subsection (5) applies—the day provided under that determination.
(5) The Commissioner may determine, by legislative instrument, circumstances in which amounts under this section are to be paid on or before the day provided under the determination. The determination may provide for amounts to be paid in instalments.
The amount to be paid
(6) The amount to be paid to the Commissioner is an amount equal to:
(a) if the * margin scheme applies to the * supply:
(i) the percentage, of the amount provided under subsection (7), determined by the Minister under subsection (8); or

(b) otherwise—the * price for the supply.
(8) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine a percentage exceeding 7%, but not exceeding 9%, for the purposes of subparagraph (6)(a)(i).

the amount to be paid to the Commissioner is an amount equal to 10% of the * GST exclusive market value (within the meaning of the * GST Act) of the supply.
(10) Despite subsections (6) and (9), if:
(a) the * supply does not consist solely of one or more supplies to which subsection (2) applies; and
(b) it is practicable to ascertain, at the time any of the * consideration for the supply (other than consideration provided as a deposit) is first provided, the amount (the reduced amount ) of the amount provided under subsection (6) or (9) that relates to supplies to which subsection (2) applies;
the amount provided under subsection (6) or (9) is taken (other than for the purposes of this subsection) to be the reduced amount.
Multiple recipients
(11) If there is more than one recipient (within the meaning of the * GST Act) of the * supply (the original supply ):
(a) treat each recipient as being the recipient of a separate supply; and
(b) treat the amount under subsection (6), (9) or (10) (as the case requires) for such a separate supply as being the same proportion of that amount for the original supply, as the proportion of the original supply that is constituted by that separate supply.

14 ‑ 255 Notification by suppliers of residential premises etc.
(1) You must not make a * supply, by way of sale or long ‑ term lease (within the meaning of the * GST Act), of * residential premises or of * potential residential land to another entity unless, before making the supply, you have given to the other entity a written notice stating:

(v) such other matters as are specified in the regulations.
(2) However, subsection (1):
(a) does not apply to a supply of * commercial residential premises; and

(i) is registered (within the meaning of the * GST Act); and

15 ‑ C Declarations
Guide to Division 15

15 ‑ 1 What this Division is about
This Division is mainly about how to work out how much an entity must withhold under Division 12.
In most cases, the entity will need to use either the Commissioner’s withholding schedules or the regulations.
The entity will also need to take into account a TFN declaration or declaration under section 15 ‑ 50 it has been given because, under the schedules and regulations, the declaration may affect how to calculate the amount to withhold.
This Division also deals with when an individual can make such a declaration (other than a TFN declaration) so as to change the amount that must be withheld from payments to the individual.

If the Commissioner does so, the amount is varied accordingly.
Note 1: Section 12 ‑ 140 is about a payment arising from an investment where the recipient does not quote its tax file number (or, in some cases, its ABN).
Note 2: Sections 12 ‑ 175 and 12 ‑ 180 are about a payment of the income of a closely held trust to a beneficiary, where the beneficiary does not quote the beneficiary’s tax file number.
Note 3: Section 12 ‑ 145 is about an investor becoming presently entitled to income of a unit trust.
Note 3A: Subdivision 12 ‑ FC is about certain labour mobility programs.

(2) The Commissioner’s power to vary an amount includes the power to reduce the amount to nil.
(3) A variation must be made:
(a) if it applies to a particular entity—by a written notice given to that entity; or
(b) if it applies to a class of entities—by legislative instrument.

21 ‑ 1 What this Division is about
This Part applies in relation to a payment by APRA under:
(a) Division 2AA of Part II of the Banking Act 1959 applying in relation to an account with an ADI; or
(b) Part VC of the Insurance Act 1973 applying in relation to a general insurance policy issued by a general insurance company;
in a way corresponding to the way this Part would have applied if the payment had been made by the ADI or company in connection with the account or policy.

Subdivision 21 ‑ A — Treatment of some payments by APRA

Table of sections

21 ‑ 5 APRA treated like ADI or general insurance company

21 ‑ 5 APRA treated like ADI or general insurance company
(1) This section applies if:
(a) an entity’s entitlement under Division 2AA of Part II of the Banking Act 1959 to be paid an amount by * APRA in connection with the entity’s account with an * ADI is met wholly or partly; or
(b) an entity’s entitlement under Part VC of the Insurance Act 1973 to be paid an amount in connection with a * general insurance policy issued by a * general insurance company is met wholly or partly.
Note 1: Division 2AA of Part II of the Banking Act 1959 entitles entities that have certain accounts with certain insolvent ADIs to be paid amounts by APRA worked out by reference to the balance of those accounts.
Note 2: Part VC of the Insurance Act 1973 entitles entities with valid claims against certain insolvent general insurance companies under certain general insurance policies issued by those companies to be paid amounts by APRA.
(2) This Part applies in relation to * APRA and the meeting of the entitlement in a way corresponding to the way in which this Part would have applied in relation to the * ADI or * general insurance company doing, in connection with the account or policy, whatever was done in meeting the entitlement.
Example: APRA (or APRA’s agent or delegate) pays an entity an amount of the entity’s entitlement relating to an account with an ADI. This Part applies in relation to APRA and the payment in a way corresponding to the way in which this Part would have applied in relation to the ADI had the ADI made a payment at that time of that amount under the arrangements for keeping the account.
