Part 1 — Preliminary

Division 1 — Preliminary

1 ‑ 1 Short title
This Act may be cited as the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 .

1 ‑ 2 Commencement
This Act commences on 1 July 2000.

1 ‑ 3 States and Territories are bound by the luxury car tax law
The * luxury car tax law binds the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory and of the Northern Territory. However, it does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

Division 2 — Overview of the luxury car tax legislation

2 ‑ 1 What this Act is about
This Act is about the luxury car tax. It is a single stage tax that is imposed on supplies and importations of luxury cars and is in addition to any GST that may be payable. The tax is only calculated on the value of the car that exceeds the luxury car tax threshold.
Note: The luxury car tax is imposed by 3 Acts:
(a) the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax Imposition—General) Act 1999 ; and
(b) the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax Imposition—Customs) Act 1999 ; and
(c) the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax Imposition—Excise) Act 1999 .

2 ‑ 5 Luxury car tax (Part 2)
(1) Part 2 sets out the rules that establish liability for the luxury car tax. The tax applies to both supplies and importations of luxury cars. (Divisions 5 and 7)
(2) There is a system of quoting which is designed to prevent the tax becoming payable until the car is sold or imported at the retail level. (Division 9)

2 ‑ 10 Paying the luxury car tax (Part 3)
(1) Amounts of luxury car tax are included in net amounts under the GST system. This has the effect of incorporating the luxury car tax into the payments and refunds system for the GST. However, assessed luxury car tax on importations is paid with customs duty (where appropriate). (Division 13)
(2) Adjustments to the net amount can arise out of circumstances that occur after the supply or importation of the car. (Division 15)
(3) Credits can arise for people who are not entitled to an adjustment but who, for example, have paid too much tax. (Division 17)
(4) Refunds can arise for primary producers and tourism operators in certain circumstances. (Division 18).

2 ‑ 15 Miscellaneous (Part 4)

Part 4 deals with miscellaneous matters.

2 ‑ 20 Interpretative provisions (Part 5)

Part 5 contains the Dictionary, which sets out a list of all the terms that are defined in this Act. It also sets out the meanings of some important concepts and rules on how to interpret this Act.

2 ‑ 25 Administration, collection and recovery provisions in the Taxation Administration Act 1953
Parts 3 ‑ 10, 4 ‑ 1 and 4 ‑ 15 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 contain provisions relating to the administration of the luxury car tax, and to the collection and recovery of amounts of luxury car tax.

Part 3 — Paying the luxury car tax

Division 13 — Paying the luxury car tax

13 ‑ 1 What this Division is about
Luxury car tax on supplies of luxury cars is added to net amounts under Division 17 of the GST Act. Adjustments in relation to supplies or importations can be made to net amounts. They may increase or decrease net amounts.
Luxury car tax on importations of luxury cars is not incorporated into net amounts but is generally paid with customs duty.
Note: Division 165 (Anti ‑ avoidance) of the GST Act will cover avoidance schemes relating to luxury car tax so far as they affect net amounts, because such schemes affect amounts payable under the GST Act.

Subdivision 13 ‑ A — Net amounts and adjustments

13 ‑ 5 Net amounts increased by amounts of luxury car tax
Your * net amount for a * tax period is increased by the sum of all of the amounts of luxury car tax (if any) that are attributable to that tax period, other than amounts on * taxable importations of luxury cars.

13 ‑ 10 Adjustments
(1) If you have any * luxury car tax adjustments that are attributable to a * tax period applying to you, alter your * net amount for the period as follows:
(a) add to that net amount for the period the sum of all the * increasing luxury car tax adjustments (if any) that are attributable to the period;
(b) subtract from that net amount the sum of all the * decreasing luxury car tax adjustments (if any) that are attributable to the period.
(2) A * luxury car tax adjustment must be made within 4 years after the supply or * importation to which the adjustment relates.

13 ‑ 15 Attribution rules for taxable supplies of luxury cars and luxury car tax adjustments
(1) The luxury car tax payable by you on a * taxable supply of a luxury car is attributable to the same * tax period, or tax periods, applying to you as the tax period or tax periods to which:
(a) if the * supply is a * taxable supply—the taxable supply is attributable; or
(b) if the supply is not a taxable supply—the supply would be attributable if it were a taxable supply.
Note: For the basic rules on attribution of taxable supplies, see section 29 ‑ 5 of the GST Act.
(1A) The luxury car tax payable by you on a * taxable supply of a luxury car that is supplied by way of lease or hire is entirely attributable to the first * tax period to which the supply of the car is attributable. This subsection has effect despite section 156 ‑ 5 of the * GST Act.
Note: Under that section, the luxury car tax could otherwise be payable on a periodic basis.
(2) A * luxury car tax adjustment that you have is attributable to the same * tax period, or tax periods, applying to you as the tax period or tax periods to which:
(a) if the luxury car tax adjustment is an * adjustment—the adjustment is attributable; or
(b) if the luxury car tax adjustment is not an adjustment—the luxury car tax adjustment would be attributable if it were an adjustment.
Note: For the basic rules on attribution of adjustments, see section 29 ‑ 20 of the GST Act.

Subdivision 13 ‑ B — Paying assessed luxury car tax on taxable importations of luxury cars

(a) at the same time, at the same place, and in the same manner, as * customs duty is payable on the car in question (or would be payable if the car were subject to customs duty); or
(b) in the circumstances specified in the regulations, within such further time specified in the regulations, and at the place and in the manner specified in the regulations.
Note 1: The regulations could (for example) allow for deferral of payments to coincide with payments of assessed net amounts.
Note 1A: For provisions about assessment of luxury car tax on taxable importations of luxury cars, see Division 155 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .
Note 2: For provisions about collection and recovery of assessed luxury car tax on taxable importations of luxury cars, see Subdivision 105 ‑ C, and Part 4 ‑ 15, in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .
(2) An officer of Customs (within the meaning of subsection 4(1) of the Customs Act 1901 ) may refuse to deliver the goods concerned unless the assessed luxury car tax has been paid.

13 ‑ 25 Security or undertaking given under section 162 or 162A of the Customs Act

Note: Section 162A of the Customs Act 1901 allows delivery of imported goods if the importer gives a security or undertaking to pay any customs duty, assessed GST and assessed luxury car tax relating to the importation.
(2) This section has effect despite section 13 ‑ 20.

13 ‑ 30 Application of Division 165 of the GST Act

Division 165 of the * GST Act applies to amounts payable under this Subdivision as if they were amounts payable under the GST Act.

Division 15 — Adjustments

15 ‑ 1 What this Division is about
Circumstances that occur after the supply or importation of a car may mean that too much or too little luxury car tax was imposed. Accordingly, adjustments are made to increase or decrease the net amount. Adjustments can be made by the supplier, the recipient or the importer, depending upon the circumstances.

Subdivision 15 ‑ A — General adjustments

15 ‑ 5 Luxury car tax adjustment event
(1) A luxury car tax adjustment event is any event which has the effect of:
(a) cancelling a supply of a * luxury car; or
(b) changing the * consideration for the supply; or
(c) causing the supply to become, or stop being, a * taxable supply of a luxury car.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), these are * luxury car tax adjustment events:
(a) the return to a supplier of a * car supplied (whether or not the return involves a change of ownership of the car);
(b) a change to the previously agreed * consideration for a supply of a car, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise.
(3) A * luxury car tax adjustment event can arise in relation to a supply of a * car even if it is not a * taxable supply of a luxury car.
(4) However, the return of a * luxury car to its supplier is not an * adjustment event if the return is for the purpose of repair or maintenance.

15 ‑ 10 Where adjustments for luxury car tax arise
You have a luxury car tax adjustment for a supply of a * luxury car for which you are liable to pay luxury car tax (or would be liable to pay luxury car tax if it were a * taxable supply of a luxury car) if:
(a) in relation to the supply, one or more * luxury car tax adjustment events occur during a * tax period; and
(b) luxury car tax on the supply was attributable to an earlier tax period (or, if the supply was not a taxable supply of a luxury car, would have been attributable to an earlier tax period had the supply been a taxable supply of a luxury car); and
(c) as a result of that adjustment event or those adjustment events, the * previously attributed luxury car tax amount for the supply no longer correctly reflects the amount of luxury car tax on the supply (the corrected luxury car tax amount ), taking into account any luxury car tax adjustments for the supply.

15 ‑ 15 Previously attributed luxury car tax amounts
The previously attributed luxury car tax amount for a supply of a * luxury car is:
(a) the amount of any luxury car tax that was attributable to a * tax period in respect of the supply; plus
(b) the sum of any * increasing luxury car tax adjustments, under this Subdivision, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply; minus
(c) the sum of any * decreasing luxury car tax adjustments, under this Subdivision, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply.

15 ‑ 20 Increasing adjustments for supplies
If the * corrected luxury car tax amount is greater than the * previously attributed luxury car tax amount, you have an increasing luxury car tax adjustment equal to the difference between the corrected luxury car tax amount and the previously attributed luxury car tax amount.

15 ‑ 25 Decreasing adjustments for supplies
If the * corrected luxury car tax amount is less than the * previously attributed luxury car tax amount, you have a decreasing luxury car tax adjustment equal to the difference between the previously attributed luxury car tax amount and the corrected luxury car tax amount.

Subdivision 15 ‑ B — Change of use adjustments

15 ‑ 30 Changes of use—supplies of luxury cars
(1) You have a decreasing luxury car tax adjustment if:
(a) you were supplied with a * luxury car; and
(b) luxury car tax was payable on the supply because you did not * quote for the supply; and
(c) you were * registered at the time of the supply; and
(d) you intend to use the car for a * quotable purpose; and
(e) you have only used the car for a quotable purpose.
(1A) You have a decreasing luxury car tax adjustment if:
(a) you are supplied with a * luxury car; and
(b) luxury car tax is payable on the supply; and
(c) you are * registered at the time of the supply; and
(d) were you to * import the car for the same purpose as your purpose in acquiring it, luxury car tax would, because of paragraph 7 ‑ 10(3)(ba), not be payable on the importation; and
(e) you do not intend to use the car, or permit it to be used, other than for that purpose.
