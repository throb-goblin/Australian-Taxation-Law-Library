1 ‑ 1 Short title
This Act may be cited as the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 .

1 ‑ 2 Commencement
This Act commences on 1 July 1997.

1 ‑ 3 Differences in style not to affect meaning
(1) This Act contains provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in a rewritten form.
(2) If:
(a) that Act expressed an idea in a particular form of words; and
(b) this Act appears to have expressed the same idea in a different form of words in order to use a clearer or simpler style;
the ideas are not to be taken to be different just because different forms of words were used.
Note: A public or private ruling about a provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is taken also to be a ruling about the corresponding provision of this Act, so far as the 2 provisions express the same ideas: see section 357 ‑ 85 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .

1 ‑ 4 Application
This Act extends to every external Territory referred to in the definition of Australia .

1 ‑ 7 Administration of this Act
The Commissioner has the general administration of this Act.
Note: An effect of this provision is that people who acquire information under this Act are subject to the confidentiality obligations and exceptions in Division 355 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .

Subdivision 2 ‑ A — How to find your way around

2 ‑ 1 The design
This Act is designed to help you identify accurately and quickly the provisions that are relevant to your purpose in reading the income tax law.
The Act contains tables, diagrams and signposts to help you navigate your way.
You can start at Division 3 (What this Act is about) and follow the signposts as far into the Act as you need to go. You may also encounter signposts to several areas of the law that are relevant to you. Each one should be followed.
Sometimes they will lead down through several levels of detail. At each successive level, the rules are structured in a similar way. They will often be preceded by a Guide to the rules at that level. The rules themselves will usually deal first with the general or most common case and then with the more particular or special cases.

Subdivision 2 ‑ B — How the Act is arranged

2 ‑ 5 The pyramid
This Act is arranged in a way that reflects the principle of moving from the general case to the particular.
In this respect, the conceptual structure of the Act is something like a pyramid. The pyramid shape illustrates the way the income tax law is organised, moving down from the central or core provisions at the top of the pyramid, to general rules of wide application and then to the more specialised topics.
Note: The Taxation Administration Act 1953 contains the provisions on collection and recovery of tax and provisions on administration.

Table of sections

2 ‑ 10 When defined terms are identified

2 ‑ 15 When terms are not identified

2 ‑ 20 Identifying the defined term in a definition

2 ‑ 10 When defined terms are identified
(1) Many of the terms used in the income tax law are defined.
(2) Most defined terms in this Act are identified by an asterisk appearing at the start of the term: as in “ * business”. The footnote that goes with the asterisk contains a signpost to the Dictionary definitions starting at section 995 ‑ 1.

2 ‑ 15 When terms are not identified
(1) Once a defined term has been identified by an asterisk, later occurrences of the term in the same subsection are not usually asterisked.
(2) Terms are not asterisked in the non ‑ operative material contained in this Act.
Note: The non ‑ operative material is described in Subdivision 2 ‑ E.
(3) The following basic terms used throughout the Act are not identified with an asterisk. They fall into 2 groups:

2 ‑ 30 Gaps in the numbering

2 ‑ 25 Purposes
Two main purposes of the numbering system in this Act are:
For example, the number of Part 2 ‑ 15 indicates that the Part is in Chapter 2. Similarly, the number of section 165 ‑ 70 indicates that the section is in Division 165.

2 ‑ 30 Gaps in the numbering
There are gaps in the numbering system to allow for the insertion of new Divisions and sections.

Table of sections

2 ‑ 35 Non ‑ operative material

2 ‑ 40 Guides

2 ‑ 45 Other material

2 ‑ 35 Non ‑ operative material
In addition to the operative provisions themselves, this Act contains other material to help you identify accurately and quickly the provisions that are relevant to you and to help you understand them.
This other material falls into 2 main categories.

2 ‑ 40 Guides
The first is the “Guides”. A Guide consists of sections under a heading indicating that what follows is a Guide to a particular Subdivision, Division etc.
Guides form part of this Act but are kept separate from the operative provisions. In interpreting an operative provision, a Guide may only be considered for limited purposes. These are set out in section 950 ‑ 150.

2 ‑ 45 Other material
The other category consists of material such as notes and examples. These also form part of the Act. They are distinguished by type size from the operative provisions, but are not kept separate from them.

Division 3 — What this Act is about

Table of sections

3 ‑ 5 Annual income tax

3 ‑ 10 Your other obligations as a taxpayer

3 ‑ 15 Your obligations other than as a taxpayer

3 ‑ 5 Annual income tax

Note 2: Income tax is imposed by the Income Tax Act 1986 and the other Acts referred to in the definition of income tax in section 995 ‑ 1.
(2) Most entities have to pay instalments of income tax before the income tax they actually have to pay can be worked out.
(3) This Act answers these questions:

1. What instalments of income tax do you have to pay? When and how do you pay them?
See Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .

2. How do you work out how much income tax you must pay?
See Division 4, starting at section 4 ‑ 1.

3. What happens if your income tax is more than the instalments you have paid? When and how must you pay the rest?

4. What happens if your income tax is less than the instalments you have paid? How do you get a refund?
See Division 3A of Part IIB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .

5. What are your other obligations as a taxpayer, besides paying instalments and the rest of your income tax?
See section 3 ‑ 10.

6. Do you have any other obligations under the income tax law?
See section 3 ‑ 15.

7. If a dispute between you and the Commissioner of Taxation cannot be settled by agreement, what procedures for objection, review and appeal are available?
See Part IVC (sections 14ZL to 14ZZS) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .

3 ‑ 10 Your other obligations as a taxpayer

Division 4 — How to work out the income tax payable on your taxable income

Table of sections

4 ‑ 1 Who must pay income tax

4 ‑ 5 Meaning of you

4 ‑ 10 How to work out how much income tax you must pay

4 ‑ 15 How to work out your taxable income

4 ‑ 25 Special provisions for working out your basic income tax liability

4 ‑ 1 Who must pay income tax
Income tax is payable by each individual and company, and by some other entities.
Note: The actual amount of income tax payable may be nil.
For a list of the entities that must pay income tax, see Division 9, starting at section 9 ‑ 1.

4 ‑ 5 Meaning of you
If a provision of this Act uses the expression you , it applies to entities generally, unless its application is expressly limited.
Note 1: The expression you is not used in provisions that apply only to entities that are not individuals.
Note 2: For circumstances in which the identity of an entity that is a managed investment scheme for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001 is not affected by changes to the scheme, see Subdivision 960 ‑ E of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 .

4 ‑ 10 How to work out how much income tax you must pay
(1) You must pay income tax for each * financial year.
(2) Your income tax is worked out by reference to your taxable income for the income year . The income year is the same as the * financial year, except in these cases:
(a) for a company, the income year is the previous financial year;
(b) if you have an accounting period that is not the same as the financial year, each such accounting period or, for a company, each previous accounting period is an income year.
Note 1: The Commissioner can allow you to adopt an accounting period ending on a day other than 30 June. See section 18 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 .
Note 2: An accounting period ends, and a new accounting period starts, when a partnership becomes, or ceases to be, a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP. See section 18A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 .
(3) Work out your income tax for the * financial year as follows:
Method statement
Step 1. Work out your taxable income for the income year.
To do this, see section 4 ‑ 15.
Step 2. Work out your basic income tax liability on your taxable income using:
(a) the income tax rate or rates that apply to you for the income year; and
(b) any special provisions that apply to working out that liability.
See the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 and section 4 ‑ 25.
Step 3. Work out your tax offsets for the income year. A tax offset reduces the amount of income tax you have to pay.
For the list of tax offsets, see section 13 ‑ 1.
Step 4. Subtract your * tax offsets from your basic income tax liability. The result is how much income tax you owe for the * financial year.
Note 1: Division 63 explains what happens if your tax offsets exceed your basic income tax liability. How the excess is treated depends on the type of tax offset.
Note 2: Section 4 ‑ 11 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 (which is about the temporary budget repair levy) may increase the amount of income tax worked out under this section.
Income tax worked out on another basis
(4) For some entities, some or all of their income tax for the * financial year is worked out by reference to something other than taxable income for the income year.
See section 9 ‑ 5.

4 ‑ 15 How to work out your taxable income
(1) Work out your taxable income for the income year like this:
Method statement
Step 1. Add up all your assessable income for the income year.
To find out about your assessable income, see Division 6.
Step 2. Add up your deductions for the income year.
To find out what you can deduct, see Division 8.
Step 3. Subtract your deductions from your assessable income (unless they exceed it). The result is your taxable income. (If the deductions equal or exceed the assessable income, you don’t have a taxable income.)
Note: If the deductions exceed the assessable income, you may have a tax loss which you may be able to utilise in that or a later income year: see Division 36.
(2) There are cases where taxable income is worked out in a special way:
Item
For this case ...
See:
1.
A company does not maintain continuity of ownership and control during the income year and does not satisfy the business continuity test

Subdivision 165 ‑ B

1B.
An entity is a * member of a * consolidated group at any time in the income year

Part 3 ‑ 90

2.
A company becomes a PDF (pooled development fund) during the income year, and the PDF component for the income year is a nil amountsection 124ZTA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
3.
A shipowner or charterer:
 has its principal place of business outside Australia; and
 carries passengers, freight or mail shipped in Australiasection 129 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
4.
An insurer who is a foreign resident enters into insurance contracts connected with Australiasections 142 and 143 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
5.
The Commissioner makes a default or special assessment of taxable incomesections 167 and 168 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
6.
The Commissioner makes a determination of the amount of taxable income to prevent double taxation in certain treaty casessection 24 of the International Tax Agreements Act 1953
Note: A life insurance company can have a taxable income of the complying superannuation class and/or a taxable income of the ordinary class for the purposes of working out its income tax for an income year: see Subdivision 320 ‑ D.

4 ‑ 25 Special provisions for working out your basic income tax liability
Subsection 392 ‑ 35(3) may increase your basic income tax liability beyond the liability worked out simply by applying the income tax rates to your taxable income.
Note: Subsection 392 ‑ 35(3) increases some primary producers’ tax liability by requiring them to pay extra income tax on their averaging components worked out under Subdivision 392 ‑ C.

5 ‑ 1 What this Division is about
If your assessed income tax liability exceeds the credits available to you under the PAYG system, this Division explains when you must pay the excess to the Commissioner.
If your assessment is amended so that you must pay income tax, or pay more income tax than under the previous assessment, this Division explains:
(a) when you must pay the additional tax; and
(b) when any associated interest charges must be paid.
Note: For provisions about the collection and recovery of income tax and other tax ‑ related liabilities, see Part 4 ‑ 15 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .

Subdivision 5 ‑ A — How to work out when to pay your income tax

Table of sections

5 ‑ 5 When income tax is payable

5 ‑ 10 When shortfall interest charge is payable

5 ‑ 15 General interest charge payable on unpaid income tax or shortfall interest charge

5 ‑ 5 When income tax is payable
Scope
(1) This section tells you when income tax you must pay for a * financial year is due and payable.
Note: The Commissioner may defer the time at which the income tax is due and payable: see section 255 ‑ 10 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .
(2) The income tax is only due and payable if the Commissioner makes an * assessment of your income tax for the year.
(3) However, if the Commissioner does make an * assessment of your income tax for the year, the tax may be taken to have been due and payable at a time before your assessment was made.
Note: This is to ensure that general interest charge begins to accrue from the same date for all like entities. General interest charge on unpaid income tax is calculated from when the tax is due and payable, not from when the assessment is made: see section 5 ‑ 15.
Original assessments—self ‑ assessment entities
(4) If you are a * self ‑ assessment entity, the income tax is due and payable on the first day of the sixth month after the end of the income year.
Example: If your income year is the same as the financial year, your income tax would be due and payable on 1 December.
Original assessments—other entities
(5) If you are not a * self ‑ assessment entity, the income tax is due and payable 21 days after the day (the return day ) on or before which you are required to lodge your * income tax return with the Commissioner.
Note: For rules about income tax returns and when they are due, see Part IV of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 .
(6) However, if you lodge your return on or before the return day and the Commissioner gives you a notice of * assessment (other than an amended assessment) after the return day, the income tax is due and payable 21 days after the Commissioner gives you the notice.
Amended assessments
(7) If the Commissioner amends your * assessment, any extra income tax resulting from the amendment is due and payable 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the amended assessment.
Note: Shortfall interest charge may be payable, on any amount of extra income tax payable as a result of the amended assessment, for each day in the period that:
(a) starts at the time income tax was due and payable on your original assessment; and
(b) ends the day before the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the amended assessment.

5 ‑ 10 When shortfall interest charge is payable
An amount of * shortfall interest charge that you are liable to pay is due and payable 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the charge.
Note: Shortfall interest charge is imposed if the Commissioner amends an assessment and the amended assessment results in an increase in some tax payable. For provisions about liability for shortfall interest charge, see Division 280 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .

5 ‑ 15 General interest charge payable on unpaid income tax or shortfall interest charge
If an amount of income tax or * shortfall interest charge that you are liable to pay remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, you are liable to pay the * general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:
(a) starts at the beginning of the day on which the amount was due to be paid; and
(b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:
(i) the income tax or shortfall interest charge;
(ii) general interest charge on any of the income tax or shortfall interest charge.
Note 1: The general interest charge is worked out under Part IIA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .
Note 2: Shortfall interest charge is worked out under Division 280 in Schedule 1 to that Act.

(1) Assessable income consists of ordinary income and statutory income.
(2) Some ordinary income, and some statutory income, is exempt income.
(3) Exempt income is not assessable income.
(4) Some ordinary income, and some statutory income, is neither assessable income nor exempt income.
For the effect of the GST in working out assessable income, see Division 17.
(5) An amount of ordinary income or statutory income can have only one status (that is, assessable income, exempt income or non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income) in the hands of a particular entity.

Operative provisions

6 ‑ 5 Income according to ordinary concepts ( ordinary income )
(1) Your assessable income includes income according to ordinary concepts, which is called ordinary income .
Note: Some of the provisions about assessable income listed in section 10 ‑ 5 may affect the treatment of ordinary income.
(2) If you are an Australian resident, your assessable income includes the * ordinary income you * derived directly or indirectly from all sources, whether in or out of Australia, during the income year.
(3) If you are a foreign resident, your assessable income includes:
(a) the * ordinary income you * derived directly or indirectly from all * Australian sources during the income year; and
(b) other * ordinary income that a provision includes in your assessable income for the income year on some basis other than having an * Australian source.
(4) In working out whether you have derived an amount of * ordinary income, and (if so) when you derived it, you are taken to have received the amount as soon as it is applied or dealt with in any way on your behalf or as you direct.

6 ‑ 10 Other assessable income ( statutory income )
(1) Your assessable income also includes some amounts that are not * ordinary income.
Note: These are included by provisions about assessable income. For a summary list of these provisions, see section 10 ‑ 5.
(2) Amounts that are not * ordinary income, but are included in your assessable income by provisions about assessable income, are called statutory income .
Note 1: Although an amount is statutory income because it has been included in assessable income under a provision of this Act, it may be made exempt income or non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income under another provision: see sections 6 ‑ 20 and 6 ‑ 23.
Note 2: Many provisions in the summary list in section 10 ‑ 5 contain rules about ordinary income. These rules do not change its character as ordinary income.
(3) If an amount would be * statutory income apart from the fact that you have not received it, it becomes statutory income as soon as it is applied or dealt with in any way on your behalf or as you direct.
(4) If you are an Australian resident, your assessable income includes your * statutory income from all sources, whether in or out of Australia.
(5) If you are a foreign resident, your assessable income includes:
(a) your * statutory income from all * Australian sources; and
(b) other * statutory income that a provision includes in your assessable income on some basis other than having an * Australian source.

6 ‑ 15 What is not assessable income
(1) If an amount is not * ordinary income, and is not * statutory income, it is not assessable income (so you do not have to pay income tax on it).
(2) If an amount is * exempt income, it is not assessable income .
Note: If an amount is exempt income, there are other consequences besides it being exempt from income tax. For example:
(3) If an amount is * non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income, it is not assessable income .
Note 1: You cannot deduct as a general deduction a loss or outgoing incurred in deriving an amount of non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income (see Division 8).
Note 2: Capital gains and losses on assets used to produce some types of non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income are disregarded (see section 118 ‑ 12).

6 ‑ 20 Exempt income
(1) An amount of * ordinary income or * statutory income is exempt income if it is made exempt from income tax by a provision of this Act or another * Commonwealth law.
For summary lists of provisions about exempt income, see sections 11 ‑ 5 and 11 ‑ 15.
(2) * Ordinary income is also exempt income to the extent that this Act excludes it (expressly or by implication) from being assessable income.
(3) By contrast, an amount of * statutory income is exempt income only if it is made exempt from income tax by a provision of this Act outside this Division or another * Commonwealth law.
(4) If an amount of * ordinary income or * statutory income is * non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income, it is not exempt income .
Note: An amount of non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income is not taken into account in working out the amount of a tax loss.

6 ‑ 23 Non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income
An amount of * ordinary income or * statutory income is non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income if a provision of this Act or of another * Commonwealth law states that it is not assessable income and is not * exempt income.
Note: Capital gains and losses on assets used to produce some types of non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income are disregarded (see section 118 ‑ 12).
For a summary list of provisions about non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income, see Subdivision 11 ‑ B.

6 ‑ 25 Relationships among various rules about ordinary income
(1) Sometimes more than one rule includes an amount in your assessable income:
For a summary list of the provisions about assessable income, see section 10 ‑ 5.
However, the amount is included only once in your assessable income for an income year, and is then not included in your assessable income for any other income year.
(2) Unless the contrary intention appears, the provisions of this Act (outside this Part) prevail over the rules about * ordinary income.
Note: This Act contains some specific provisions about how far the rules about ordinary income prevail over the other provisions of this Act.

Division 8 — Deductions

Table of sections

8 ‑ 1 General deductions

8 ‑ 5 Specific deductions

8 ‑ 10 No double deductions

8 ‑ 1 General deductions
(1) You can deduct from your assessable income any loss or outgoing to the extent that:
(a) it is incurred in gaining or producing your assessable income; or
(b) it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a * business for the purpose of gaining or producing your assessable income.
Note: Division 35 prevents losses from non ‑ commercial business activities that may contribute to a tax loss being offset against other assessable income.
(2) However, you cannot deduct a loss or outgoing under this section to the extent that:
(a) it is a loss or outgoing of capital, or of a capital nature; or
(b) it is a loss or outgoing of a private or domestic nature; or
(c) it is incurred in relation to gaining or producing your * exempt income or your * non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income; or
(d) a provision of this Act prevents you from deducting it.
For a summary list of provisions about deductions, see section 12 ‑ 5.
(3) A loss or outgoing that you can deduct under this section is called a general deduction .
For the effect of the GST in working out deductions, see Division 27.
Note If you receive an amount as insurance, indemnity or other recoupment of a loss or outgoing that you can deduct under this section, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20 ‑ A.

8 ‑ 5 Specific deductions
(1) You can also deduct from your assessable income an amount that a provision of this Act (outside this Division) allows you to deduct.
(2) Some provisions of this Act prevent you from deducting an amount that you could otherwise deduct, or limit the amount you can deduct.
(3) An amount that you can deduct under a provision of this Act (outside this Division) is called a specific deduction .
Note: If you receive an amount as insurance, indemnity or other recoupment of a deductible expense, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20 ‑ A.
For a summary list of provisions about deductions, see section 12 ‑ 5.

8 ‑ 10 No double deductions
If 2 or more provisions of this Act allow you deductions in respect of the same amount (whether for the same income year or different income years), you can deduct only under the provision that is most appropriate.

How much is included in your assessable income?

20 ‑ 35 If the expense is deductible in a single income year
(1) Your assessable income includes an * assessable recoupment of a loss or outgoing if:
(a) you can deduct the whole of the loss or outgoing for the * current year; or
(b) you have deducted or can deduct the whole of the loss or outgoing for an earlier income year.
Note 1: The operation of this section may be affected if a balancing charge has been included in your assessable income because of a deduction for the loss or outgoing: see section 20 ‑ 45.
Note 2: Recoupment of a loss or outgoing for which you can deduct amounts over more than one income year is covered by section 20 ‑ 40.
Note 3: Recoupment of a loss or outgoing that is only partially deductible is covered by section 20 ‑ 50.
Total assessed not to exceed the loss or outgoing
(2) The total of all amounts that subsection (1) includes in your assessable income for one or more income years in respect of a loss or outgoing cannot exceed the amount of the loss or outgoing.
Recoupment received before income year of the deduction
(3) If:
(a) you can deduct the whole of a loss or outgoing for the * current year; and
(b) before the current year you received an * assessable recoupment of the loss or outgoing;
your assessable income for the current year includes so much of the recoupment as subsection (1) would have included if you had instead received the recoupment at the start of the current year.

20 ‑ 40 If the expense is deductible over 2 or more income years
(1) This section includes an amount in your assessable income if:
(a) you receive in the * current year an * assessable recoupment of a loss or outgoing for which you can deduct amounts over 2 or more income years; or
(b) you received in an earlier income year an * assessable recoupment of a loss or outgoing of that kind (unless all of the recoupment has already been included in your assessable income for one or more earlier income years by this section or a * previous recoupment law).
(This section applies even if the recoupment was received before the first of those income years.)
Note: Recoupment of a loss or outgoing that is only partially deductible is covered by section 20 ‑ 50.
(2) Work out as follows how much is included in your assessable income for the * current year because of one or more * assessable recoupments of the loss or outgoing.
Note: The method statement ensures that assessable recoupments are included:
Method statement
Step 1. Add up all the * assessable recoupments of the loss or outgoing that you have received (in the * current year or earlier). The result is the total assessable recoupment .
Step 2. Add up the amounts (if any) included in your assessable income for earlier income years, in respect of the loss or outgoing, by this section or a * previous recoupment law. The result is the recoupment already assessed . (If no amount was included, the recoupment already assessed is nil.)
Step 3. Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total assessable recoupment. The result is the unassessed recoupment .
Step 4. Add up each amount that you can deduct for the loss or outgoing for the * current year, or you have deducted or can deduct for the loss or outgoing for an earlier income year. The result is the total deductions for the loss or outgoing .
Note: The total deductions may be reduced if an amount has been included in your assessable income because of a balancing adjustment: see section 20 ‑ 45.
Step 5. Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total deductions for the loss or outgoing. The result is the outstanding deductions .
Step 6. The unassessed recoupment is included in your assessable income, unless it is greater than the outstanding deductions. In that case, the amount of the outstanding deductions is included instead.
Example: At the start of the 2002 ‑ 03 income year, a company incurs $100,000 to start to hold a depreciating asset. The company uses the prime cost method, and the effective life is 10 years. $10,000 is deductible for the 2002 ‑ 03 income year and for each of the following 9 income years under section 40 ‑ 25.
In the 2002 ‑ 03 income year, the company receives $20,000 as recoupment. How much is assessable for the 2002 ‑ 03 income year?
Applying the method statement:
After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $20,000.
After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is nil.
After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is: total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed, i.e. $20,000 minus 0 = $20,000.
After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $10,000.
After step 5: the outstanding deductions are: total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already assessed, i.e. $10,000 minus 0 = $10,000.
After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $10,000.
Applying the method statement to the 2003 ‑ 04 income year: a further $10,000 is included in the company’s assessable income.

20 ‑ 45 Effect of balancing charge
(1) This section may affect the operation of section 20 ‑ 35 or 20 ‑ 40 (as appropriate) if:
(a) a balancing adjustment is required for the * current year (or for an earlier income year) because you have deducted or can deduct an amount for an income year for the loss or outgoing; and
(b) an amount (the balancing charge ) is included in your assessable income for the * current year (or for the earlier income year) because of the balancing adjustment.
To find out about balancing adjustments, see Subdivision 40 ‑ D.
Effect on section 20 ‑ 35
(2) In applying section 20 ‑ 35, treat each of the following as reduced by the balancing charge:
(a) the amount of the loss or outgoing;
(b) the total of what you can deduct for the loss or outgoing for the * current year, or have deducted or can deduct for an earlier income year.
Effect on section 20 ‑ 40
(3) In applying the method statement in subsection 20 ‑ 40(2), reduce the total deductions for the loss or outgoing by the balancing charge.
Example: Continuing the example in subsection 20 ‑ 40(2): at the start of the 2005 ‑ 06 income year, the company:
As a result of the sale, a balancing adjustment of $5,000 is included under section 40 ‑ 285 in the company’s assessable income for that income year.
How much of the recoupment amount received in the 2005 ‑ 06 income year is assessable for that income year?
Applying the method statement in subsection 20 ‑ 40(2):
After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $30,000 (received during 2002 ‑ 03 and 2005 ‑ 06).
After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is $20,000 (for 2002 ‑ 03 and 2003 ‑ 04).
After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is: total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed, i.e. $30,000 minus $20,000 = $10,000.
After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $30,000 ($10,000 for each of 2002 ‑ 03, 2004 ‑ 04 and 2004 ‑ 05), reduced by $5,000 (the amount included in assessable income for the balancing adjustment), i.e. $25,000.
After step 5: the outstanding deductions are: total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already assessed, i.e. $25,000 minus $20,000 = $5,000.
After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $5,000.

20 ‑ 50 If the expense is only partially deductible
(1) This section extends the operation of section 20 ‑ 35 or 20 ‑ 40 (as appropriate) to a case where the total of what you can deduct under a provision (the deduction provision ) for a loss or outgoing is limited to a proportion of the loss or outgoing.
(2) If you receive an * assessable recoupment of the loss or outgoing, section 20 ‑ 35 or 20 ‑ 40 applies as if:
(a) you had incurred only that proportion of the loss or outgoing, but could deduct the whole of that proportion under the deduction provision; and
(b) you had received only that proportion of the recoupment.
Example: You incur expenditure of $500. A provision listed in section 20 ‑ 30 entitles you to deduct 10% of the expenditure ($50) over 5 years. This means you can deduct $10 in each of the 5 years.
You recoup $300 of the expenditure. This section treats you as receiving only 10% of the recoupment. Therefore, $30 is dealt with by section 20 ‑ 40.

20 ‑ 55 Meaning of previous recoupment law
(1) Previous recoupment law means a provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 listed in this table.

What if you can deduct a loss or outgoing incurred by another entity?

20 ‑ 60 If you are the only entity that can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing
This Subdivision applies in a different way if:
(a) an entity (other than you) incurs a loss or outgoing; and
(b) you can deduct the whole of the loss or outgoing for an income year, or you can deduct amounts for the loss or outgoing over 2 or more income years; and
(c) no other entity can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing; and
(d) the entity that incurred the loss or outgoing receives one or more amounts as * recoupment of the loss or outgoing.
This Subdivision (except this section and section 20 ‑ 65) applies as if you had incurred the loss or outgoing and had also received the * recoupment.

20 ‑ 65 If 2 or more entities can deduct amounts for the loss or outgoing
(1) Special rules apply if:
(a) an entity (the first entity ) incurs a loss or outgoing; and
(b) 2 or more entities (the deducting entities , which may include the first entity) have deducted or can deduct amounts for the loss or outgoing (whether for the same income year or for different income years); and
(c) the first entity receives one or more amounts as * recoupment of the loss or outgoing.
(2) This Subdivision (except this section and section 20 ‑ 60) applies as if the first entity and the deducting entities together constituted a single entity (the notional entity ) that had:
(a) incurred the loss or outgoing; and
(b) received the amount or amounts as * recoupment; and
(c) included in its assessable income any amount included in the assessable income of any of the deducting entities under a * previous recoupment law or this Subdivision (except this section).
(3) If because of subsection (2) the notional entity’s assessable income for an income year (the assessment year ) would include an amount under this Subdivision (the assessable amount ), the amount reverses in the assessment year the deductions for the loss or outgoing, in accordance with the rules in subsection (5).
(4) The assessable income of each deducting entity for the assessment year includes the total amounts (if any) by which that entity’s actual deductions for the loss or outgoing are reversed in that income year.
(5) Deductions for the loss or outgoing are reversed in the assessment year as follows:
(a) the amounts by which deductions are reversed total the assessable amount (unless all the deductions have been reversed);
(b) a deduction for an income year is not reversed until all deductions for earlier income years have been reversed;
(c) a deduction is not reversed in the assessment year to the extent that it has already been reversed in an earlier year;
(d) if each of 2 or more entities can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing for the same income year, those deductions are reversed in the assessment year by amounts proportionate to the amounts of the deductions.

Subdivision 20 ‑ B — Disposal of a car for which lease payments have been deducted

Guide to Subdivision 20 ‑ B

20 ‑ 100 What this Subdivision is about
This Subdivision reverses the effect of deductions for lease payments for a car leased to you (or to your associate), but only if you make a profit by disposing of the car after acquiring it from the lessor. The smallest of these amounts is included in your assessable income:
 your profit on the disposal;
 the total deductible lease payments for the period of the lease;
 the total amounts you could have deducted for the car’s decline in value if, instead of leasing it, you had owned it and used it solely for the purpose of producing assessable income.

20 ‑ 160 Disposal of an interest in a car

20 ‑ 105 Map of this Subdivision
The usual case

20 ‑ 110 Disposal of a leased car for profit
(1) Your assessable income includes the * profit you make on disposing of a * car if:
(a) the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and
(b) the car was leased to you and has been leased to no ‑ one else; and
(c) you or another entity can deduct for the income year any of the lease payments paid or payable by you, or have deducted or can deduct any of them for an earlier income year, under this Act; and
(d) you acquired the car from the lessor.
Note 1: Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may still be included in your assessable income:
Note 2: In some cases you do not include an amount in your assessable income:
(2) However, the amount included cannot exceed the smaller of these limits:
(a) the total lease payments for the lease that you or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year;
(b) the amount of * notional depreciation for the lease period.
Note 1: If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the largest amount: see section 20 ‑ 130.
Note 2: In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:
(3) You increase those limits if you have previously leased the * car from the same lessor, or from an * associate of that lessor.
You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each previous lease of that kind that you or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year.
You increase the second limit by the amount of * notional depreciation for the period of each previous lease of that kind.

20 ‑ 115 Working out the profit on the disposal
(1) The profit on the disposal is the amount by which the * consideration receivable for the disposal exceeds:
plus:
(2) The consideration receivable is worked out using this table:
Consideration receivable for the disposal of the car
Item
In this situation:
the consideration receivable is:
1 you sell the * car for an amount specific to itthe proceeds of the sale, less the expenses of the sale
2 you sell the * car with other property without a specific amount being allocated to itthe part of the total proceeds of the sale that is reasonably attributable to the car less the part of the reasonably attributable expenses of the sale
3 you trade the * car in and buy another carthe value of the trade ‑ in, plus any other consideration you receive
4 you sell the * car and another entity buys another carthe amount by which the cost of the other car is reduced by the sale, plus any other consideration you receive
5 you dispose of the * car to an insurer because it is lost or destroyedthe amount or value received or receivable under the insurance policy
(3) However, if the disposal of the * car is a * taxable supply, the consideration receivable does not include an amount equal to the * GST payable on the supply.

20 ‑ 120 Meaning of notional depreciation
This is how to work out the notional depreciation for a lease period:
Method statement
Step 1. Compare:
• the * car’s * cost to the lessor for the purposes of Subdivision 40 ‑ C (which is about working out the cost of * depreciating assets);
with:
• the car’s * termination value for the purposes of section 40 ‑ 300 when the lessor disposed of it.
Step 2. If the car’s cost exceeds the car’s termination value, multiply the excess by:
• the number of days in the lease period;
divided by:
• the number of days the lessor owned the car.
Step 3. The result is the notional depreciation for the lease period.
Step 4. If the car’s cost does not exceed the car’s termination value, the notional depreciation for the lease period is zero.
Note 1: The notional depreciation for the lease period represents:
adjusted by:
Note 2: The car’s cost to the lessor is worked out differently if the lessor acquired it in the 1996 ‑ 97 income year or an earlier income year: see section 20 ‑ 105 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 .
Note 3: The car’s termination value is worked out differently if the lessor disposed of it in the 1996 ‑ 97 income year or an earlier income year: see section 20 ‑ 110 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 .

The associate case

20 ‑ 125 Disposal of a leased car for profit
(1) Your assessable income includes the * profit you make on disposing of a * car if:
(a) section 20 ‑ 110 does not include an amount in your assessable income because of the disposal; and
(b) the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and
(c) the car was leased to you or your * associate; and
(d) you, your associate or another entity can deduct for the income year any of the lease payments paid or payable by the lessee, or have deducted or can deduct any of them for an earlier income year, under this Act; and
(e) either:
(i) you, your associate, or entities including you or your associate, acquired the car from the lessor; or
(ii) another entity acquired the car from the lessor under an * arrangement that enabled you or your associate to acquire the car.
Note 1: Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may be included in your assessable income if you disposed of an interest in a car (rather than the car itself): see section 20 ‑ 160.
Note 2: In some cases you do not include an amount in your assessable income:
(2) However, the amount included cannot exceed the smallest of these limits:
(a) the total lease payments for the lease that you, your * associate or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year;
(b) the amount of * notional depreciation for the lease period;
(c) if an entity other than you, or if entities including you, acquired the * car from the lessor—the amount by which the * consideration receivable for the disposal of the car by you exceeds the total of:
(i) the car’s cost to that entity, or those entities; and
(ii) any capital expenditure that entity, or any of those entities, incurred on the car after that acquisition and before you acquired it.
Note 1: If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the largest amount: see section 20 ‑ 130.
Note 2: In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:
Example: Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it from the lessor for $4,000. Your associate sells it to you for $3,000. You sell it for $10,000.
Your profit is $10,000 (the consideration receivable) less $3,000 (the car’s cost to you) = $7,000.
The first 2 limits on the amount to be included in your assessable income are $9,000 (total deductible lease payments for the lease) and $8,000 (notional depreciation for the lease period).
Since your associate acquired the car from the lessor, the third limit is $10,000 (the consideration receivable by you) less $4,000 (the car’s cost to the associate) = $6,000.
The amount you include in your assessable income cannot exceed the smallest of the limits. So, you do not include your profit of $7,000. Instead, you include $6,000 (the smallest of the limits).
(3) You increase the first 2 limits if you, or your associate, have previously leased the * car from the same lessor, or from an associate of that lessor.
You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each previous lease of that kind that you, your * associate or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year.
You increase the second limit by the amount of * notional depreciation for the period of each previous lease of that kind.

Successive leases

20 ‑ 130 Successive leases
If, because of 2 or more leases of the * car, there are different amounts that could be included in your assessable income because of the disposal, only the largest of those amounts is included.

Previous disposals of the car

20 ‑ 135 No amount included if earlier disposal for market value
You do not include an amount in your assessable income because of the disposal if, after the lessor disposed of the * car and before you disposed of it, an entity other than you disposed of the car and:
(a) the * consideration receivable for that disposal was at least the * market value of the car at the time of that disposal; or
(b) because of that disposal, that market value was included, or an amount worked out using that market value was included, in the entity’s assessable income under this Act.

20 ‑ 140 Reducing the amount to be included if there has been an earlier disposal
Each limit on the amount to be included in your assessable income because of your disposal of the * car is reduced if, after the lease period began and before your disposal, the car, or an interest in it, was disposed of in one of these situations:
Reducing each limit on the amount to be included
Item
In this situation:
reduce each limit by:
1 Section 20 ‑ 110 or 20 ‑ 125 included an amount in your assessable income in respect of such an earlier disposal by youthat amount
2 Section 20 ‑ 110 or 20 ‑ 125 included an amount in another entity’s assessable income in respect of such an earlier disposal by the other entitythat amount
3 Section 20 ‑ 110 or 20 ‑ 125 would have included an amount in your assessable income in respect of such an earlier disposal by you but for the operation of section 20 ‑ 145
that amount
4 Section 20 ‑ 110 or 20 ‑ 125 would have included an amount in another entity’s assessable income in respect of such an earlier disposal by the other entity but for the operation of section 20 ‑ 145
that amount
5 Section 20 ‑ 150 reduced the amount to be included in your assessable income in respect of such an earlier disposal by youthe amount of the reduction
6 Section 20 ‑ 150 reduced the amount to be included in another entity’s assessable income in respect of such an earlier disposal by the other entitythe amount of the reduction
Examples: Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it. Your associate disposes of it to you and section 20 ‑ 110 includes $500 in your associate’s assessable income.
You later dispose of the car.
In working out the amount to include in your assessable income for your disposal, you can reduce each limit in subsection 20 ‑ 125(2) by $500 because the disposal by your associate occurred after the lease period began.
Contrast this case:
You lease a car for 5 years and then acquire it. You dispose of it to another entity and section 20 ‑ 110 includes $1,000 in your assessable income.
You lease the car from that entity for 2 years and then acquire it. You later dispose of it.
In working out the amount to include in your assessable income in respect of the second lease, you cannot reduce each limit in subsection 20 ‑ 110(2) by $1,000 because the first disposal did not occur after the start of that lease.
Note: If the earlier disposal occurred in the 1996 ‑ 97 income year or an earlier income year, each limit may be able to be reduced by a further amount: see section 20 ‑ 115 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 .

Miscellaneous rules

20 ‑ 145 No amount included if you inherited the car
You do not include an amount in your assessable income because of the disposal if you inherited the * car.

20 ‑ 150 Reducing the amount to be included if another provision requires you to include an amount for the disposal
The amount to be included in your assessable income because of the disposal is reduced by any amount that another provision of this Act (except sections 40 ‑ 285 and 40 ‑ 370) requires you to include in your assessable income because of the disposal.
Note: sections 40 ‑ 285 and 40 ‑ 370 are about including an amount after making a balancing adjustment on the disposal of a car.

20 ‑ 155 Exception for particular cars taken on hire
This Subdivision does not apply to these kinds of leases:
(a) letting a * car on hire under a * hire purchase agreement; or
(b) letting a * car on hire under an agreement of a kind ordinarily entered into by people who take cars on hire intermittently on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.

20 ‑ 157 Exception for small business entities
This Subdivision does not apply to you if, at any time in the income year in which you disposed of the * car, it was allocated to a pool of yours under Division 328.

Disposals of interests in a car: special rules apply

20 ‑ 160 Disposal of an interest in a car
(1) This Subdivision applies to the disposal of an interest in a * car in almost the same way as it does to the disposal of the car itself. The differences are set out below.
(2) Your assessable income includes so much of your * profit on the disposal as is reasonable. The limits in subsections 20 ‑ 110(2) and 20 ‑ 125(2) do not apply.
(3) The cost of the interest to you is taken to be a reasonable amount.
(4) Sections 20 ‑ 135 and 20 ‑ 140 do not apply to the disposal.
Note 1: Section 20 ‑ 135 says that you do not include an amount if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value.
Note 2: Section 20 ‑ 140 allows you to reduce the amount to be included if there has been an earlier disposal of the car.
(5) Section 20 ‑ 145 applies to the disposal if you inherited either the interest or the * car itself.
Note: Section 20 ‑ 145 says that you do not include an amount if you inherited the car.

Operative provisions

25 ‑ 5 Tax ‑ related expenses
(1) You can deduct expenditure you incur to the extent that it is for:
(a) managing your * tax affairs; or
(b) complying with an obligation imposed on you by a * Commonwealth law, insofar as that obligation relates to the * tax affairs of an entity; or
(ca) a penalty under Subdivision 162 ‑ D of the * GST Act; or
(cb) levy under the Major Bank Levy Act 2017 ; or
(d) obtaining a valuation in accordance with section 30 ‑ 212 or 31 ‑ 15; or
(e) managing your * Australian GloBE tax affairs; or
(f) complying with an obligation imposed on you by a * Commonwealth law, insofar as that obligation relates to the Australian GloBE tax affairs of an entity.
Note 1: To find out whether a trustee of a deceased estate can deduct expenditure under this section, see subsection 69(7) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 .
Note 2: If you receive an amount as recoupment of the expenditure, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20 ‑ A.
No deduction for certain expenditure
(2) You cannot deduct under subsection (1):
(a) * tax; or
(b) an amount withheld or payable under Part 2 ‑ 5 or Part 2 ‑ 10 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ; or
(c) expenditure for * borrowing money (including payments of interest) to pay an amount covered by paragraph (a) or (b); or
(d) expenditure for a matter relating to the commission (or possible commission) of an offence against an * Australian law or a * foreign law; or
(e) a fee or commission for advice about the operation of a * Commonwealth law relating to taxation, unless that advice is provided by a * recognised tax adviser.
No deduction for expenditure excluded from general deductions
(3) You cannot deduct expenditure under subsection (1) to the extent that a provision of this Act (except section 8 ‑ 1) expressly prevents or limits your deducting it under section 8 ‑ 1 (about general deductions). It does not matter whether the provision specifically refers to section 8 ‑ 1.
No deduction for capital expenditure
(4) You cannot deduct capital expenditure under subsection (1). However, for this purpose, expenditure is not capital expenditure merely because the * tax affairs or * Australian GloBE tax affairs concerned relate to matters of a capital nature.
Example: Under this section, you can deduct expenditure you incur in applying for a private ruling on whether you can depreciate an item of property.
Use of property taken to be for income producing purpose
(5) Under some provisions of this Act it is important to decide whether you used property for the * purpose of producing assessable income. For provisions of that kind, your use of property is taken to be for that purpose insofar as you use the property for:
(a) managing your * tax affairs; or
(b) complying with an obligation imposed on you by a * Commonwealth law, insofar as that obligation relates to the * tax affairs of another entity.
Example: You buy a computer to prepare your tax returns. The expenditure you incur in buying the computer is capital expenditure and cannot be deducted under this section.
However, to the extent that you use the computer in preparing your income tax return, you will be able to deduct the decline in value of your computer under Division 40. That is because, under this subsection, the computer is property that you are taken to use for the purpose of producing assessable income.
(6) If another provision of this Act expressly provides that a particular use of property is not taken to be for the * purpose of producing assessable income, that provision overrides subsection (5).
Expenditure by trustee of deceased estate
(8) If:
(a) after you die, the trustee of your deceased estate incurs expenditure; and
(b) had you incurred the expenditure before you died, you could have deducted it under subsection (1);
for the purposes of assessing the trustee for the income year in which you died, the expenditure is a deduction under that subsection.

25 ‑ 10 Repairs
(1) You can deduct expenditure you incur for repairs to premises (or part of premises) or a * depreciating asset that you held or used solely for the * purpose of producing assessable income.
Property held or used partly for that purpose
(2) If you held or used the property only partly for that purpose, you can deduct so much of the expenditure as is reasonable in the circumstances.
No deduction for capital expenditure
(3) You cannot deduct capital expenditure under this section.

25 ‑ 15 Amount paid for lease obligation to repair
You can deduct an amount that you pay for failing to comply with a lease obligation to make repairs to premises if you use or have used the premises for the * purpose of producing assessable income.
Note: The amount is assessable income of the entity to which you pay it: either as ordinary income under section 6 ‑ 5 or because it is included by section 15 ‑ 25.

25 ‑ 20 Lease document expenses
(1) You can deduct expenditure you incur for preparing, registering or stamping:
(a) a lease of property; or
(b) an assignment or surrender of a lease of property;
if you have used or will use the property solely for the * purpose of producing assessable income.
Property used partly for that purpose
(2) If you have used, or will use, the leased property only partly for that purpose, you can deduct the expenditure to the extent that you have used, or will use, the leased property for that purpose.

25 ‑ 25 Borrowing expenses
(1) You can deduct expenditure you incur for * borrowing money, to the extent that you use the money for the * purpose of producing assessable income. In most cases the deduction is spread over the * period of the loan.
For the cases where the deduction is not spread, see subsection (6).
Note: Your deductions under this section may be reduced if any of your commercial debts have been forgiven in the income year: see Subdivision 245 ‑ E.
Income year when money used solely for the purpose of producing assessable income
(2) You can deduct for an income year the maximum amount worked out under subsection (4) if you use the * borrowed money during that income year solely for the * purpose of producing assessable income.
Example: In 1997 ‑ 98 you borrow $100,000 and incur expenditure of $1,500 for the borrowing. You use the money to buy a house. Throughout 1998 ‑ 99 you rent the house to a tenant. You can deduct for the expenditure for 1998 ‑ 99 the maximum amount worked out under subsection (4).
Income year when borrowed money used partly for that purpose
(3) If you use the money only partly for that purpose during that income year, you can deduct the proportion of that maximum amount that is appropriate having regard to the extent that you used the * borrowed money for that purpose.
Note: You cannot deduct anything for that income year if you do not use the money for that purpose at all during that income year.
Maximum deduction for an income year
(4) You work out as follows the maximum amount that you can deduct for the expenditure for an income year:
Method statement
Step 1. Work out the remaining expenditure as follows:
• For the income year in which the * period of the loan begins, it is the amount of the expenditure.
• For a later income year, it is the amount of the expenditure reduced by the maximum amount that you can deduct for the expenditure for each earlier income year.
Step 2. Work out the remaining loan period as follows:
• For the income year in which the * period of the loan begins, it is the period of the loan (as determined at the end of the income year).
• For a later income year, it is the period from the start of the income year until the end of the period of the loan (as determined at the end of the income year).
Step 3. Divide the remaining expenditure by the number of days in the remaining loan period.
Step 4. Multiply the result from Step 3 by the number of days in the remaining loan period that are in the income year.
Example: To continue the example in subsection (2): suppose the original period of the loan is 4 years starting on 1 September 1997. What is the maximum amount you can deduct for the expenditure for 1997 ‑ 98?
Applying the method statement:
After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the expenditure).
After Step 2: the remaining loan period is 4 years from 1 September 1997 (1,461 days).
After Step 3: the result is $1,500 divided by 1,461 = $1.03.
After Step 4: the result is $1.03 multiplied by 302 days = $310.06.
Suppose you repay the loan early, on 31 December 1998. What is the maximum amount you can deduct for the expenditure for 1998 ‑ 99?
Applying the method statement:
After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the expenditure) reduced by $310.06 (the maximum amount you can deduct for 1997 ‑ 98) = $1,189.94.
After Step 2: the remaining loan period is the period from 1 July 1998 to 31 December 1998 (183 days).
After Step 3: the result is $1,189.94 divided by 183 days = $6.50.

The rules referred to in this subsection apply to that deduction.

25 ‑ 40 Loss from profit ‑ making undertaking or plan
(1) You can deduct a loss arising from the carrying on or carrying out of a profit ‑ making undertaking or plan if any profit from that plan would have been included in your assessable income by section 15 ‑ 15 (which is about profit ‑ making undertakings and plans).
When section does not apply
(2) You cannot deduct a loss under subsection (1) if the loss arises in respect of the sale of property acquired on or after 20 September 1985.
Note: If you sell property you acquired before 20 September 1985 for profit ‑ making by sale, you may be able to deduct a loss on the sale: see section 52 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 .
Notice to Commissioner
(3) You can deduct a loss under subsection (1), insofar as it arises in respect of property, only if:
(a) you notified the Commissioner that you acquired the property for the purpose of profit ‑ making by sale or for the carrying on or carrying out of any profit ‑ making undertaking or plan (however described); or
(b) the Commissioner is satisfied that you acquired the property for either of those purposes.
When notice must have been given
(4) The notice must have been given at or before the time you lodged your * income tax return:
(a) for the income year in which you acquired the property; or
(b) if you were not required to lodge an income tax return for that income year—for the first income year after that income year for which you were required to lodge one.

25 ‑ 45 Loss by theft etc.
You can deduct a loss in respect of money if:
(a) you discover the loss in the income year; and
(b) the loss was caused by theft, stealing, embezzlement, larceny, defalcation or misappropriation by your employee or * agent (other than an individual you employ solely for private purposes); and
(c) the money was included in your assessable income for the income year, or for an earlier income year.
Note: If you receive an amount as recoupment of the loss, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20 ‑ A.

25 ‑ 47 Misappropriation where a balancing adjustment event occurs
(1) You can deduct an amount if:
(a) a * balancing adjustment event occurs for a * depreciating asset you * held; and
(b) your employee or * agent misappropriates (whether by theft, embezzlement, larceny or otherwise) all or part of the amount applicable to you under:
(i) item 8 of the table in subsection 40 ‑ 300(2); or
(ii) item 1, 3, 4 or 6 of the table in subsection 40 ‑ 305(1);
in relation to the balancing adjustment event.
Note 1: The amount applicable to you under subsection 40 ‑ 300(2) or 40 ‑ 305(1) may be the market value of an asset or of a non ‑ cash benefit.
Note 2: If you receive an amount as recoupment of the amount misappropriated, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20 ‑ A.
(2) The amount you can deduct is so much of the amount misappropriated as represents an amount applicable to you under item 8 of the table in subsection 40 ‑ 300(2) or item 1, 3, 4 or 6 of the table in subsection 40 ‑ 305(1) in relation to the * balancing adjustment event.
(3) You can deduct the amount for the income year in which the misappropriation happens.
(4) You must reduce the amount you can deduct under this section if your deductions for the asset have been reduced under section 40 ‑ 25 because of use for a purpose other than a * taxable purpose. The reduction is by the same proportion you reduce the balancing adjustment amount for the asset under section 40 ‑ 290.
(4A) You must further reduce the amount you can deduct under this section if your deductions for the asset have been reduced under section 40 ‑ 27 (about second ‑ hand assets in residential property). The reduction is by the same proportion you reduce the balancing adjustment amount for the asset under section 40 ‑ 291.
(5) Section 170 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 does not prevent the amendment of an assessment for the purposes of giving effect to this section for an income year if:
(a) you discover the misappropriation after you lodged your * income tax return for the income year; and
(b) the amendment is made at any time during the period of 4 years starting immediately after you discover the misappropriation.

25 ‑ 50 Payments of pensions, gratuities or retiring allowances
(1) You can deduct a payment of a pension, gratuity or retiring allowance that you make to:
(a) an employee; or
(b) a former employee; or
(c) a dependant of an employee or a former employee.
(2) However, you can deduct it only to the extent that it is made in good faith in consideration of the past services of the employee, or former employee, in any * business that you carried on for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income.
(3) You cannot deduct a payment under this section if you can deduct it under any other provision of this Act.

25 ‑ 55 Payments to associations
(1) You can deduct a payment you make for membership of a trade, business or professional association.
Note: Alternatively, you can deduct the expense under section 8 ‑ 1 (which is about general deductions) if you satisfy the requirements of that section.
Maximum amount—$42
(2) However, $42 is the maximum amount you can deduct under this section for the payments that you make in the income year to any one association.
If you deduct under section 8 ‑ 1
(3) If you deduct a payment under section 8 ‑ 1 (which is about general deductions) instead of this section:
(a) the payment does not count towards the $42 limit; and
(b) the amount that you can deduct for the payment is not limited to $42.

25 ‑ 60 Parliament election expenses
(1) You can deduct expenditure you incur in contesting an election for membership of:
(a) the Parliament of the Commonwealth; or
(b) the Parliament of a State; or
(c) the Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory; or
(d) the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory of Australia.
Note 1: Entertainment expenses are excluded: see section 25 ‑ 70.
Note 2: If you receive an amount as recoupment of the expenditure, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20 ‑ A.

25 ‑ 65 Local government election expenses
(1) You can deduct expenditure you incur in contesting an election for membership of a * local governing body, but you cannot deduct more than $1,000 per election. You deduct the expenditure for the income year in which you incur it.
(2) However, you can deduct more than the $1,000 limit if:
(a) you have received an amount as * recoupment of the expenditure; and
(b) some or all of that amount is included in your assessable income for an income year; and
(c) the total of your deductions for the election would be less than the $1,000 limit if you disregarded so much (the assessed recoupment ) of the expenditure as equals the amount so included in your assessable income.
In that case:
(d) the assessed recoupment is disregarded in applying the $1,000 limit; and
(e) the further amount that you can deduct because of paragraph (d) is deducted for the income year referred to in paragraph (b).
Example: Chris is elected to the Bunyip Shire Council. In the 2007 ‑ 08 income year he incurs expenditure of $1,200 in contesting the election, of which he deducts $1,000 (the limit under subsection (1)).
In 2008 ‑ 09, Chris receives $360 as an assessable recoupment of the expenditure. $300 of that is included in his assessable income by section 20 ‑ 35 (as extended by section 20 ‑ 50).
Because of the assessable recoupment, $300 of the expenditure is disregarded under paragraph (2)(d) in applying the $1,000 limit. As a result, Chris’s deductions are treated as being only $700, which is less than the limit. This does not affect his original deduction for 2007 ‑ 2008, but it means he can deduct the previously undeducted $200, for 2008 ‑ 09 (see paragraph (2)(e)).
This triggers a further application of section 20 ‑ 35 (as extended by section 20 ‑ 50) to include the remaining $60 of the assessable recoupment in Chris’s assessable income for 2008 ‑ 09. His total deductions (net of recoupment included in assessable income) come to $840, which is the same as his original expenditure (net of recoupment).
Note: An amount you receive as recoupment of expenditure may be included in your assessable income as an assessable recoupment under Subdivision 20 ‑ A, as ordinary income under section 6 ‑ 5 or as statutory income under some other provision.

25 ‑ 70 Deduction for election expenses does not extend to entertainment
(1) To the extent that you incur expenditure in respect of providing * entertainment, you cannot deduct it under section 25 ‑ 60 or 25 ‑ 65.
(2) However, subsection (1) does not stop you deducting expenditure to the extent that you incur it in respect of:
(a) providing * entertainment that is available to the public generally; or
(b) providing food or drink to yourself, unless it would be concluded that you have a purpose of enabling or facilitating * entertainment to be provided to someone else.

25 ‑ 75 Rates and land taxes on premises used to produce mutual receipts
(1) An entity can deduct these amounts it pays for premises:
(a) rates which are annually assessed;
(b) land tax imposed under a * State law or * Territory law.
But only if it uses the premises:
(c) for the purpose of producing mutual receipts; or
(d) in carrying on a * business for the purpose of producing mutual receipts; or
(e) for the purpose of producing amounts to which section 59 ‑ 35 applies (amounts that would be mutual receipts but for prohibition on distributions to members or issue of MCIs); or
(f) in carrying on a * business for the purpose of producing amounts to which section 59 ‑ 35 applies.
Note: If the entity receives an amount as recoupment of the rates or land tax, the amount may be included in its assessable income: see Subdivision 20 ‑ A
When premises used only for deductible purposes
(2) The entity can deduct the whole of the rates or land tax if it uses the premises only in one or more of these ways:
(a) for the purpose of producing mutual receipts;
(b) in carrying on a * business for the purpose of producing mutual receipts;
(c) for the * purpose of producing assessable income.
When premises used partly for deductible purposes
(3) If the entity uses the premises partly in one or more of the ways referred to in subsection (2) and partly in some other way, it can deduct the rates or land tax to the extent that it uses the premises in one or more of the ways referred to in that subsection.
No deduction under section 8 ‑ 1
(4) The entity cannot deduct the rates or land tax under section 8 ‑ 1 (which is about general deductions).

25 ‑ 85 Certain returns in respect of debt interests
(1) This section deals with a * return that an entity pays or provides on a * debt interest.
(2) The * return is not prevented from being a * general deduction for an income year under section 8 ‑ 1 merely because:
(a) the return is * contingent on aspects of the economic performance (whether past, current or future) of:
(i) the entity or a part of the entity’s activities; or
(ii) a * connected entity of the entity or a part of the activities of a connected entity of the entity; or
(b) the return secures a permanent or enduring benefit for the entity or a connected entity of the entity.
(3) If the * return is a * dividend, the entity can deduct the return to the extent to which it would have been a * general deduction under section 8 ‑ 1 if:
(a) the payment of the return were the incurring by the entity of a liability to pay the same amount as interest; and
(b) that interest were incurred in respect of the finance raised by the entity and in respect of which the return was paid or provided; and
(c) the * debt interest retained its character as a debt interest for the purposes of subsection (2).
(4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to a * return to the extent to which it would be a * general deduction under section 8 ‑ 1 apart from this section.
(4A) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to a * return on a * debt interest that is a * Division 230 financial arrangement.
(5) Subject to regulations made for the purposes of subsection (6), subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to the return to the extent to which the annually compounded internal rate of return exceeds the * benchmark rate of return for the interest increased by 150 basis points.
(6) The regulations may provide that subsection (5) applies in the circumstances specified in the regulations as if the reference to 150 basis points were a reference to a greater or lesser number of basis points.

25 ‑ 90 Deduction relating to foreign non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income
An * Australian entity can deduct an amount of loss or outgoing from its assessable income for an income year if:
(a) the amount is incurred by the entity in deriving income from a foreign source; and
(b) the income is * non ‑ assessable non ‑ exempt income under section 768 ‑ 5, or section 23AI or 23AK of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ; and
(c) the amount is a cost in relation to a * debt interest issued by the entity that is covered by paragraph (1)(a) of the definition of debt deduction .
Note: This section does not apply to a Division 230 financial arrangement.

26 ‑ 47 Non ‑ business boating activities
Object
(1) The object of this section is to improve the integrity of the taxation system by preventing deductions from boating activities that are not carried on as a * business being offset against other assessable income.
Rule
(2) This Act applies to you as if so much of the amounts relating to using or * holding boats that you could otherwise deduct for an income year as exceeds your assessable income from using or holding boats for that year:
(a) were not deductible for that income year; and
(b) were an amount (a quarantined amount ) relating to using or holding boats that you can deduct for the next income year.
Note: A quarantined amount may be reduced under subsection (5) (for boat capital gains), reduced under subsection (7) (where you deduct part of a quarantined amount under subsection (6) for boat business profits), reduced under subsection (8) (about exempt income) or affected by subsection (10) (about bankruptcy).
Example: Ian does not use his boat in a business. In Year 1, Ian would be able to claim $100,000 in deductions for the boat (but for this subsection), including interest, depreciation and running costs. He earns only $40,000 of income from the boat. He can only deduct $40,000. He carries the remaining $60,000 forward to Year 2 (the quarantined amount).
In Year 2, Ian has $95,000 of expenses and $30,000 of income for the boat. He can deduct $30,000. The quarantined amount is now $125,000: the quarantined amount from Year 1 plus the excess of expenses over income from Year 2.
In Year 3, Ian has $60,000 of expenses and $150,000 of income from the boat. The expenses from Year 3 plus the quarantined amount is $185,000. Therefore, Ian claims a deduction of $150,000 and carries forward $35,000 to Year 4.
Exception: business use
(3) The rule in subsection (2) does not apply to amounts that are attributable to one or more of the following:
(a) * holding a boat as your * trading stock;
(b) using a boat (or holding it) mainly for letting it on hire in the ordinary course of a * business that you carry on;
(c) using a boat (or holding it) mainly for transporting the public or goods for payment in the ordinary course of a business that you carry on;
(d) using a boat for a purpose that is essential to the efficient conduct of a business that you carry on.
Note: Even if this exception applies to you, you may still have to quarantine losses under Division 35 (deferral of losses from non ‑ commercial business activities).
Exception: fringe benefits
(4) The rule in subsection (2) does not apply to so much of an amount you incur in * providing a * fringe benefit.
Modification if you have boat capital gains
(5) You reduce a quarantined amount you have for an income year by so much of that amount as is applied under section 118 ‑ 80 to reduce a * capital gain you have for the year in relation to a boat. You make this reduction before you deduct an amount under subsection (6).
Deduction if you have boat business profits
(6) You can deduct all or part of your remaining quarantined amount for an income year if your assessable income for the year from activities of a kind referred to in subsection (3) exceeds your deductions for the year relating to those activities. The amount you can deduct is the lesser of that excess and that remaining quarantined amount.
(7) You reduce your quarantined amount for the year by the amount you deduct. You make this reduction before a reduction under subsection (8).
Modification if you have exempt income
(8) You reduce any remaining quarantined amount you have for an income year by your * net exempt income for that year (after * utilising the net exempt income under section 35 ‑ 15 (about non ‑ commercial business activities) or section 36 ‑ 10 or 36 ‑ 15 (about tax losses)).
Modification if you become bankrupt
(9) The modification in subsection (10) has effect if:
(a) in an income year (the current year ) you become bankrupt or are released from a debt by the operation of an Act relating to bankruptcy; or
(b) you became bankrupt before the current year and:
(i) the bankruptcy is annulled in the current year under section 74 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 because your creditors have accepted a proposal for a composition or scheme of arrangement; and
(ii) under the composition or scheme of arrangement, you have been, will be or may be released from some or all of the debts from which you would have been released if you had instead been discharged from the bankruptcy.
(10) This Act applies to you as if any amount that:
(a) is a quarantined amount for you for the current year or was a quarantined amount for you for an earlier year; and
(b) has not been applied under section 118 ‑ 80 and that you have not yet deducted;
were not an amount relating to using or holding boats that you can deduct for the current year or a later year.

(c) on * in ‑ house software if the expenditure on the software is allocated to a software development pool; and
(d) on * project amounts if the amounts are allocated to a project pool.
Reduction to pools etc.
(2) There is a reduction under subsection (3) or (5) if:
(a) the pooled expenditure relates directly or indirectly to a * creditable acquisition or * creditable importation; and
(b) the entity is or becomes entitled to an * input tax credit in an income year (the credit year ) for the acquisition or importation and the credit year occurs after the income year in which the acquisition or importation occurred.
(2A) There is a reduction under subsection (4) if:
(a) the pooled expenditure relates directly or indirectly to a * creditable acquisition or * creditable importation; and
(b) the entity is or becomes entitled to an * input tax credit in an income year (the credit year ) for the acquisition or importation.
Reduced cost of assets allocated to a pool
(2B) A * depreciating asset’s * cost is reduced if:
(a) an entity’s acquisition or importation of the asset constitutes a * creditable acquisition or * creditable importation; and
(b) the entity is or becomes entitled to an * input tax credit for the acquisition or importation and the income year in which the acquisition or importation occurred is the same as the one in which the input tax credit arose; and
(c) the asset is allocated to a low ‑ value pool or a pool under Division 328 for or in that year.
The reduction is the amount of the input tax credit.
Low ‑ value pools
(3) For a low ‑ value pool, the * closing pool balance of the pool for:
(a) if the credit year is later than the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the income year before the credit year; or
(b) if the credit year is the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the credit year;
is reduced by an amount equal to the input tax credit.
Software development pools and project pools
(4) For a software development pool or a project pool, the expenditure in the pool for the credit year, or the * pool value for the credit year, is reduced by an amount equal to the * input tax credit.
Small business pools
(5) For a pool under Division 328, the * opening pool balance of the pool for the credit year is reduced by an amount equal to the input tax credit.
No reduction if market value
(5A) However, there is no reduction to the * cost of a * depreciating asset if its cost is modified under Division 40 to be its * market value.
Second element of cost
(6) There is a reduction under subsection (7) if:
(a) the entity incurs expenditure in an income year (also the credit year ) that is included in the second element of the * cost of a * depreciating asset allocated to a low ‑ value pool or a pool under Division 328 for or in the credit year; and
(b) the entity is or becomes entitled, after the credit year, to an * input tax credit for the expenditure.
(7) An amount equal to the amount of the * input tax credit is applied in reduction of:
(a) for a low ‑ value pool:
(i) if the credit year is later than the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the income year before the credit year; or
(ii) if the credit year is the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the credit year; or
(b) for a pool under Division 328—the * opening pool balance of the pool for the credit year.
(7A) There is a reduction to an amount of expenditure included in the second element of the * cost of a * depreciating asset if:
(a) the asset is allocated to a low ‑ value pool or a pool under Division 328 for or in the income year in which the expenditure was incurred; and
(b) the entity that incurred the expenditure is or becomes entitled to an * input tax credit for the expenditure; and
(c) the entitlement arises in the income year in which the expenditure was incurred.
The reduction is the amount of the input tax credit.
Increasing adjustments
(8) There is an increase under subsection (9) if the entity has an * increasing adjustment (except one that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the * GST Act) in an income year (the adjustment year ) that relates directly or indirectly to a * creditable acquisition or * creditable importation to which the pooled expenditure relates.
Note: For an increasing adjustment that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the GST Act, see section 27 ‑ 92.
(9) An amount equal to the amount of that * increasing adjustment is added to:
(a) for a low ‑ value pool:
(i) if the adjustment year is later than the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the income year before the adjustment year; or
(ii) if the adjustment year is the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the adjustment year; or
(b) for a pool under Division 328—the * opening pool balance of the pool for the adjustment year; or
(c) for * in ‑ house software—the amount of expenditure allocated to the software development pool for the adjustment year; or
(d) for a project pool—the * pool value for the adjustment year.
Decreasing adjustments
(10) There is a decrease under subsection (11) if the entity has a * decreasing adjustment (except one that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the * GST Act) in an income year (also the adjustment year ) that relates directly or indirectly to a * creditable acquisition or * creditable importation to which the pooled expenditure relates.
Note: For a decreasing adjustment that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the GST Act, see section 27 ‑ 87.
(11) An amount equal to the amount of the * decreasing adjustment is applied in reduction of:
(a) for a low ‑ value pool:
(i) if the adjustment year is later than the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the income year before the adjustment year; or
(ii) if the adjustment year is the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the adjustment year; or
(b) for a pool under Division 328—the * opening pool balance of the pool for the adjustment year; or
(c) for * in ‑ house software—the amount of expenditure allocated to the software development pool for the adjustment year; or
(d) for a project pool—the * pool value for the adjustment year.
(12) If the amount available for reduction under subsection (11) is more than the amount referred to in paragraph (11)(a), (b), (c) or (d) (whichever is applicable), the excess is included in the entity’s assessable income unless the entity is an * exempt entity.

27 ‑ 105 Other Division 40 expenditure
(1) This section applies to expenditure for which an entity can deduct amounts under Division 40 (but not under Subdivision 40 ‑ B or 40 ‑ E, or Subdivision 40 ‑ I to the extent that that Subdivision relates to project pools).
(2) The amount of the expenditure is reduced if the entity is or becomes entitled to an * input tax credit for a * creditable acquisition or * creditable importation to which the expenditure directly or indirectly relates. The reduction is the amount of the input tax credit that relates to that expenditure.
(3) If the entity has a * decreasing adjustment in an income year that relates directly or indirectly to the expenditure, an amount equal to the decreasing adjustment is included in the entity’s assessable income for that income year.
(4) If the entity has an * increasing adjustment in an income year that relates directly or indirectly to the expenditure, the entity can deduct an amount equal to the increasing adjustment for that income year.
(5) If the entity is a partnership and partners in that partnership can deduct amounts under Division 40 because section 40 ‑ 570 or 40 ‑ 665 applies, an amount equal to the * input tax credit, the * decreasing adjustment or the * increasing adjustment is apportioned to each of the partners as set out in subsection 40 ‑ 570(2) or 40 ‑ 665(2).
(6) However, this section does not apply to an * exempt entity.

27 ‑ 110 Input tax credit etc. relating to 2 or more things
This Subdivision applies to an * input tax credit, or an * increasing adjustment or * decreasing adjustment, that relates directly or indirectly to 2 or more things of which at least one is a * depreciating asset as if a reasonable proportion of the input tax credit or adjustment related directly or indirectly to each of those depreciating assets and each of those other things.

(1) This Division applies to an individual.
(2) It also applies to a partnership that includes at least one individual, as if the partnership were an individual.
(3) It does not apply to any other entity.

28 ‑ 12 Car expenses
(1) If you owned or leased a * car, you can deduct for the car’s expenses an amount or amounts worked out using one of 2 methods.
Note 1: For particular types of cars taken on hire you cannot use one of the 2 methods: see section 28 ‑ 165.
Note 2: In certain circumstances the lessee of a luxury car is taken to be its owner (see subsection 242 ‑ 15(2)).
Note 3: In certain circumstances (for example, under a hire purchase agreement) the notional buyer of property is taken to be its owner (see subsection 240 ‑ 20(2)).
(2) You must use one of the 2 methods unless an exception applies. If you can’t use either of the methods, you can’t deduct anything for the * car expenses.

28 ‑ 13 Meaning of car expense
(1) A car expense is a loss or outgoing to do with a * car.
(2) In addition, any of the following is a car expense:
(a) a loss or outgoing to do with operating a * car;
(b) the decline in value of a car.
(3) None of the following is a car expense:
(a) a loss or outgoing incurred, or a payment made, in respect of travel outside Australia;
(b) a taxi fare or similar loss or outgoing.

Operative provision

28 ‑ 20 Rules governing choice of method

28 ‑ 15 Choosing between the 2 methods
(1) Below is a diagram giving information about the 2 methods of calculating car expense deductions.
(2) The 2 methods give you the choice of which method best suits your situation and needs. For instance, one method may involve more paperwork than the other, but could give you bigger deductions.

Operative provision

28 ‑ 20 Rules governing choice of method
(1) You can choose only one method for all the * car expenses for the * car for the income year. Choosing one method precludes the other method.
(2) However, you can change your choice for the income year.
Example: You choose the “log book” method and deduct $1,000. On audit, the Commissioner finds that your claim is too high and should be reduced to $500. You would have been able to deduct $700 if you had chosen the “cents per kilometre” method. This rule lets you change your choice and deduct the $700.
(3) You can also choose different methods for the same * car for different income years and different methods for different cars for the same year.

Subdivision 28 ‑ C — The “cents per kilometre” method

Table of sections

28 ‑ 25 How to calculate your deduction

28 ‑ 30 Capital allowances

28 ‑ 35 Substantiation

28 ‑ 25 How to calculate your deduction
(1) To calculate your deduction using the “cents per kilometre” method, use this formula:
(2) But you can use this formula for the first 5,000 * business kilometres only. If the * car travelled more than 5,000 business kilometres, you must discard the kilometres in excess of 5,000.
Example: If the car travelled 5,085 business kilometres, you could claim for 5,000, and would lose the extra 85.
(3) Business kilometres are kilometres the * car travelled in the course of:
(a) producing your assessable income; or
(b) your * travel between workplaces.
You calculate the number of business kilometres by making a reasonable estimate.
(4) For the purposes of subsection (1), the Commissioner may, by legislative instrument, determine rates of cents per kilometre for cars for an income year.
(5) In determining a rate, the Commissioner must have regard to the average operating costs for the cars to be covered by that rate.
Note: Examples of operating costs include fixed costs such as registration, insurance and depreciation, and variable costs such as fuel and maintenance.

28 ‑ 30 Capital allowances
If a * balancing adjustment event occurs for the * car, you will need to refer to the capital allowances rules in Division 40 to find out how using this method affects the operation of those rules. See section 40 ‑ 370 (about balancing adjustments for some cars).

28 ‑ 35 Substantiation
To use this method, you do not need to substantiate the * car expenses for the * car.

Subdivision 28 ‑ F — The “log book” method

Table of sections

28 ‑ 90 How to calculate your deduction

28 ‑ 95 Eligibility

28 ‑ 100 Substantiation

28 ‑ 90 How to calculate your deduction
(1) To use the “log book” method, you multiply the amount of each * car expense by the * business use percentage.
The expense
(2) The expense must qualify as a deduction under some provision of this Act outside this Division (or would qualify if, while you * held the * car, you had used it only in producing your assessable income). If only part of the expense would qualify, you multiply that part by the * business use percentage.
Example: You borrow money to buy a car. You make repayments of principal and payments of interest.
You cannot deduct the repayments of principal because they are capital expenses.
The interest payments would be deductible in full if, throughout the income year, you had used the car only in producing your assessable income.
Using the “log book” method:
To find out whether an expense qualifies as a deduction under this Act, see Division 8 (Deductions).
The percentage
(3) The business use percentage is calculated by dividing:
 the number of * business kilometres that the * car travelled in the period when you * held it during the income year;
by
 the total number of kilometres that the car travelled in that period;
and expressing the result as a percentage.
(4) Business kilometres are kilometres the * car travelled in the course of:
(a) producing your assessable income; or
(b) your * travel between workplaces.
(5) You calculate the number of business kilometres by making a reasonable estimate. The estimate must take into account all relevant matters, including:
(a) any log books, odometer records or other records you have; and
(b) any variations in the pattern of use of the * car; and
(c) any changes in the number of cars you used in the course of producing your assessable income.
(6) You hold a * car while you own it, or it is leased to you, for use in the course of producing your assessable income, even if it is also used for some other purpose.
Note 1: In certain circumstances the lessee of a luxury car is taken to be its owner (see subsection 242 ‑ 15(2)).
Note 2: In certain circumstances the notional buyer of property is taken to be its owner (see subsection 240 ‑ 20(2)).

28 ‑ 95 Eligibility
You can use this method only if you * held the * car for some or all of the income year.

28 ‑ 100 Substantiation
(1) To use this method, you must substantiate the * car expenses under Subdivision 900 ‑ C.
(2) You must also keep a log book. Subdivision 28 ‑ G explains:
 how often you need to keep a log book;
 how to keep a log book.
The log book is relevant to estimating the number of business kilometres the * car travelled in the period when you * held it during the income year.
(3) You must keep odometer records for the period when you * held the * car during the income year. Subdivision 28 ‑ H tells you about odometer records, which document the total number of kilometres the car travelled in that period.
(4) You must record the following information, in writing, before you lodge your * income tax return:
(a) your estimate of the number of * business kilometres; and
(b) the * business use percentage.
However, the Commissioner may allow you to record the information later.
(5) You must retain the log book and the odometer records. Subdivision 28 ‑ I has the rules about this.

28 ‑ 125 How to keep a log book

28 ‑ 130 Replacing one car with another

28 ‑ 110 Steps for keeping a log book
There are 3 steps you need to follow in keeping a log book:
 identify an income year for which to keep a log book;
 choose a period of at least 12 weeks for the log book to cover;
 record journeys made in the car during the log book period in the course of producing your assessable income.

Operative provisions

28 ‑ 115 Income years for which you need to keep a log book
(1) You need to keep a log book for the first income year for which you use this method for the * car.
(2) Having kept a log book for one income year, you don’t need to keep a new one for the next 4 or more income years unless subsection (3) or (4) requires it. If you haven’t kept a new log book for 4 income years in a row, you must keep one for the next income year.
Example: If you keep a log book in 1997 ‑ 98, you would need to keep the next one in 2002 ‑ 2003, unless subsection (3) or (4) requires one sooner.
(3) You must keep a log book for an income year if the Commissioner sends you a notice before the year directing you to keep a log book for the * car for that year.
(4) You must keep a log book for an income year if, during that year, you get one or more additional * cars for which you want to use the “log book” method for that year.
(5) When you replace one * car with another, you might have a period when you * hold both the new car and the old car, or a period when you no longer * hold the old car but do not yet hold the new car. In both these cases, you are treated for the purposes of subsection (4) as if you held the one car continuously.
(6) You may choose to keep a log book for an income year even if you don’t need to; for example, because you want to establish a higher * business use percentage.

28 ‑ 120 Choosing the 12 week period for a log book
(1) The log book must cover a continuous period of at least 12 weeks throughout which you * held the * car. If you hold the car for less than 12 weeks, the period must be the entire period for which you held the car.
(2) The period may overlap the start or end of the income year, so long as it includes part of the year.
(3) If you want to use the “log book” method for 2 or more * cars for the same income year, the log books for those cars must cover periods that are concurrent.

28 ‑ 125 How to keep a log book
(1) It is in your interests to record in the log book any journey made in the * car during the log book period in the course of producing your assessable income. If a journey is not recorded, the log book will indicate a lower * business use percentage than is actually the case.
(2) A journey is recorded by making in the log book an entry specifying:
(a) the day the journey began and the day it ended;
(b) the * car’s odometer readings at the start and end of the journey;
(c) how many kilometres the car travelled on the journey;
(d) why the journey was made.
The record must be made at the end of the journey or as soon as possible afterwards.
(3) If 2 or more journeys in a row are made in the * car on the same day in the course of producing your assessable income, they can be recorded as a single journey.
(4) The following must be entered in the log book:
(a) when the log book period begins and ends;
(b) the * car’s odometer readings at the start and the end of the period;
(c) the total number of kilometres that the car travelled during the period;
(d) the number of kilometres that the car travelled, in the course of producing your assessable income, on journeys recorded in the log book;
(e) the number of kilometres referred to in paragraph (d), expressed as a percentage of the total number referred to in paragraph (c).
Each of the entries must be made at or as soon as possible after the start or end of the period, as appropriate.
(5) Each entry in the log book must be in English.

28 ‑ 130 Replacing one car with another
(1) For the purposes of using the “log book” method, you may nominate one * car as having replaced another car with effect from a day specified in the nomination.
(2) After the nomination takes effect, the replacement * car is treated as the original car, and the original car is treated as a different car. This means that you do not need to repeat for the replacement car the steps you have already taken for the original car under this Subdivision.
(3) You must record the nomination in writing before you lodge your * income tax return for the income year in which the nomination takes effect. However, the Commissioner may allow you to do it later.
(4) You must retain the nomination document until the end of the period for which you must retain the last log book that you began to keep for the original * car before the day of effect of the nomination.
(5) Section 28 ‑ 150 (which is about retaining log books) applies to the nomination document in the same way as it applies to that last log book.

Operative provision

28 ‑ 140 How to keep odometer records for a car for a period
(1) Odometer records for a period are kept in the form of a document in which the following are entered:
(a) the * car’s odometer readings at the start and the end of the period;
(b) if there is a nomination under section 28 ‑ 130 to replace the car with another * car with effect from a day in that period—the odometer readings, at the end of that day, of both cars affected by the nomination.
(2) Each entry under subsection (1) must be in English and must be made at or as soon as possible after the start or end of the period, or the end of the specified day, as appropriate.
(3) The following must also be entered in the document:
(a) the * car’s make, model and registration number (if any);
(b) if the car has an internal combustion engine—its engine capacity expressed in cubic centimetres;
(c) if there is a nomination under section 28 ‑ 130 to replace the car with another * car—the corresponding details for the other car affected by the nomination.
(4) Each entry under subsection (3) must be made in English and must be made before you lodge your * income tax return.
(5) The Commissioner may allow you to make an entry under this section after you lodge your * income tax return.

Subdivision 28 ‑ I — Retaining the log book and odometer records

Table of sections

28 ‑ 150 Retaining the log book for the retention period

28 ‑ 155 Retaining odometer records

28 ‑ 150 Retaining the log book for the retention period
(1) You must retain the log book:
(a) first, until the end of the latest income year for which you rely on the log book to support your calculation of the * business use percentage for the * car; and
(b) then for another 5 years.
The period for which you must retain the log book is called the retention period .
(2) The 5 years start on the due day for lodging your * income tax return for that latest income year. If you lodge your return later, the 5 years start on the day you lodge it.
(3) However, the * retention period is extended if, when the 5 years end, you are involved in a dispute with the Commissioner that relates to a deduction worked out using a * business use percentage that you are relying on the log book to support. See section 900 ‑ 170.
(4) If you do not retain the log book for the * retention period, you cannot deduct any amount worked out using a * business use percentage that you are relying on the log book to support. If you have already deducted such an amount, your assessment may be amended to disallow the deduction.
(5) For the purposes of the rules about retaining and producing records of expenses (see Subdivision 900 ‑ G), the log book is treated as a record of the * car expenses for each year for which you use a * business use percentage that you are relying on the log book to support.
(6) If you lose the log book, there are rules that might help you in section 900 ‑ 205. For the purposes of the rules about relief from the effects of failing to substantiate (see Subdivision 900 ‑ H), not doing something required by this Division is treated in the same way as not doing something necessary to follow the rules in Division 900.

28 ‑ 155 Retaining odometer records
(1) You must retain your odometer records relating to the period when you * held the * car in the income year.
(2) If you keep a log book for the income year, you must retain the odometer records for the same period as the log book, and section 28 ‑ 150 applies to them in the same way as it applies to the log book.
(3) If you don’t keep a log book for the income year, you must retain the odometer records for the same period as written evidence of a * car expense for the * car for the income year, and section 900 ‑ 75 applies to them in the same way as it applies to written evidence of an expense.
Note: Section 900 ‑ 75 is about retaining written evidence of a car expense.

28 ‑ 165 Exception for particular cars taken on hire
(1) For particular types of * cars taken on hire you cannot use one of the 2 methods to calculate your deductions for * car expenses.
(2) Instead, you must calculate the deductions under the normal principles governing deductions, including the rules for apportioning a loss or outgoing that is only partly attributable to producing assessable income.
(3) This section applies to a taxi taken on hire.
(4) It also applies to a * motor vehicle taken on hire under an agreement of a kind ordinarily entered into by people who take motor vehicles on hire intermittently, as the occasion requires, on an hourly, daily, weekly or short term basis, except if the motor vehicle:
(a) has been taken on hire under successive agreements of a kind that result in substantial continuity of the motor vehicle being taken on hire; or
(b) it is reasonable to expect that the motor vehicle will be taken on hire under successive agreements of a kind that will so result.

28 ‑ 170 Exception for particular cars used in particular ways
(1) For particular types of * cars used in particular ways you don’t need to use one of the 2 methods to calculate your deductions for * car expenses.
(2) You may use one of the 2 methods, or you may instead calculate the deductions under the normal principles governing deductions, including the rules for apportioning a loss or outgoing that is only partly attributable to producing assessable income.
(3) This section applies if, whenever you used the * car in the income year:
(a) the car was covered by the description in column 2 of an item in the table below; and
(b) you used the car as described in column 3 of that item.

As an employer, you provided the car for the exclusive use of one or more of the following:
(a) your employees;
(b) their * relatives;
in circumstances where one or more of them was entitled to use the car for private purposes.
Note: This Subdivision also applies to entities that are not employers, but pay (or are liable to pay) withholding payments covered by subsection 28 ‑ 185(3).

28 ‑ 175 Further miscellaneous exceptions
(1) This section lists some miscellaneous cases where you don’t need to use one of the 2 methods to calculate your deductions for * car expenses.
(2) You may use one of the 2 methods, or you may instead calculate the deductions under the normal principles governing deductions, including the rules for apportioning a loss or outgoing that is only partly attributable to producing assessable income.
(3) The cases are as follows:
(a) the * car was unregistered throughout the period when you * held it during the income year, and during that period you used it principally in the course of producing your assessable income; or
(b) at some time during the income year the * car was part of the * trading stock of a * business of selling cars that you carried on, and you didn’t use the car at any time during that year; or
(c) the expense is to do with repairs to or other work on the * car, and you incurred it in the course of a * business that you carried on of doing repairs or other work on cars.
In applying paragraph (a), the car is taken to be registered in a particular place while it is lawful to drive the car on a public road there.

28 ‑ 180 Car expenses related to award transport payments
(1) Subdivision 900 ‑ I (Award transport payments) allows certain losses or outgoings to be deducted without getting written evidence. The losses or outgoings are * transport expenses related to an allowance or reimbursement paid or payable to you by your employer under an * industrial instrument that was in force on 29 October 1986.
Note: This Subdivision also applies to entities that are not employers, but pay (or are liable to pay) withholding payments covered by subsection 28 ‑ 185(3).
(2) If that Subdivision lets you deduct * car expenses, or parts of * car expenses, without getting written evidence, you don’t need to use any of the 2 methods to calculate your deductions for those expenses or parts of expenses.
(3) However, your use of the 2 methods for other * car expenses you incur for the * car for the income year is affected, unless you elect not to rely on Subdivision 900 ‑ I. Section 900 ‑ 250 deals with this matter.

28 ‑ 185 Application of Subdivision 28 ‑ J to recipients and payers of certain withholding payments

30 ‑ 10 Index

30 ‑ 5 How to find your way around this Division
(1) You should start at Subdivision 30 ‑ A unless you are making a contribution or gift to a political party, independent candidate or member.
Note: Subdivision 30 ‑ DA deals with the deductibility of contributions and gifts to political parties, independent candidates and members.
(2) Subdivision 30 ‑ A contains a table of all the gifts and contributions that you can deduct. You need to look at the table to see whether the type of gift or contribution you are making is covered by it.
(3) In some cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30 ‑ B. It has a number of tables that list particular funds, authorities or institutions that deductible gifts can be made to.
(4) In other cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30 ‑ C. It contains rules that apply to particular gifts of property.
(4AA) Subdivision 30 ‑ BA provides for the Commissioner to endorse as a deductible gift recipient an entity that is, or operates, a fund, authority or institution. The relevance of the Subdivision to you is that generally you can deduct only a gift you make to a recipient that is endorsed or named in:
(a) this Division; or
(b) regulations made for the purposes of this Division.
Note: The fact that gifts to a recipient registered in the Australian Business Register are deductible will be shown in the Register.
(4AB) Subdivision 30 ‑ CA sets out administrative rules which do not directly affect whether you can deduct a gift you make. The rules require:
(a) a receipt issued by an entity for a gift to the entity or to a fund, authority or institution operated by the entity to show the entity’s ABN; and
(b) the Australian Business Registrar to enter in the Australian Business Register a statement in relation to an entity entered in the Register if:
(i) gifts to the entity are deductible; or
(ii) gifts to a fund, authority or institution operated by the entity are deductible.
(4B) Subdivision 30 ‑ DB allows you to spread deductions for certain gifts and covenants over up to 5 income years.

Valuation requirements

30 ‑ 200 Getting written valuations
(1) You satisfy the valuation requirements if you get 2 or more written valuations of the gift you made.
Note 1: In most cases, you need to get these written valuations to be able to deduct a gift of property that you make to a recipient covered by item 4, 5 or 6 of the table in section 30 ‑ 15.
Note 2: You do not need to get written valuations in the circumstances set out in section 30 ‑ 205.
(2) The valuations must be by different individuals, each of whom is an approved valuer of the kind of property you are giving away.
Note: Section 30 ‑ 210 deals with how an individual becomes an approved valuer.
(3) Each valuation must state the amount that, in the opinion of the valuer, was:
(a) the * GST inclusive market value of the property on the day you made the gift; or
(b) the * GST inclusive market value of the property on the day the valuation was made.
(4) If a valuation states the * GST inclusive market value of the property on the day the valuation was made, it must have been made within 90 days before or after the gift was made. However, the Commissioner may allow a longer period than this.

30 ‑ 205 Proceeds of the sale would have been assessable
(1) You do not need to get written valuations of the gift you made if:
(a) no amount is included in your assessable income in respect of the gift you made; but
(b) an amount would have been included in your assessable income if you had sold the property instead of making the gift.
(2) However, this section does not apply if, apart from the operation of subsection 118 ‑ 60(2), an amount would have been included in your assessable income in respect of the gift you made.

30 ‑ 210 Approved valuers
(1) The * Arts Secretary may approve an individual as a valuer of a particular kind of property. The approval must be in writing, signed by the Secretary.
(2) The Secretary must, in deciding whether to approve an individual, have regard to:
(a) the individual’s qualifications, experience and knowledge in valuing that kind of property; and
(b) the individual’s knowledge of the current * GST inclusive market value of that kind of property; and
(c) the individual’s standing in the professional community.

30 ‑ 212 Valuations by the Commissioner
(1) If you make a gift or contribution that is covered by a provision of this Division that refers to the value of property as determined by the Commissioner, you must seek the valuation from the Commissioner.
(2) The Commissioner may charge you the amount worked out in accordance with the regulations for making the valuation.

Working out the amount you can deduct for a gift of property

30 ‑ 215 How much you can deduct
(1) This section contains the rules for working out how much you can deduct for a gift of property that you make to a recipient covered by item 4, 5 or 6 of the table in section 30 ‑ 15.
(2) The general rule is that the amount you can deduct for a gift of this kind is the average of the * GST inclusive market values (as reduced under subsection 30 ‑ 15(3) if that subsection applies) specified in the written valuations you got from the approved valuers.
Note: In some situations you must reduce the amount you can deduct: see section 30 ‑ 220.
(3) The exceptions to the general rule are set out in this table:
Amount you can deduct for a gift of property
Item
In this case:
The amount you can deduct is:
1 Section 30 ‑ 205 (which is about the proceeds of the sale being assessable) applies, and you bought the propertythe amount you paid for the property, reduced by the amount of any * input tax credit to which you are or were entitled for your * acquisition of the property
2 Section 30 ‑ 205 (which is about the proceeds of the sale being assessable) applies, and you created or produced the propertyso much of the cost of creation or production as you would have been able to deduct if you had sold the property, reduced by the amount of any * input tax credit to which you are or were entitled for your * acquisitions to the extent that they were made for the purpose of creating or producing the property
3 Neither of cases 1 and 2 applies, and you acquired the property:
(a) less than one year before making the gift (otherwise than by inheriting it); or
(b) for the purpose of giving it away; or
(c) subject to an * arrangement that the property would be given awaythe lesser of the amount you paid for the property and:
(a) if the average of the written valuations you got fairly represents the * GST inclusive market value (as reduced under subsection (4) if that subsection applies) of the property on the day you made the gift—that average; or
(b) if it does not—the * GST inclusive market value (as reduced under subsection (4) if that subsection applies) of the property on the day you made the gift
4 None of cases 1 to 3 applies, and the average of the written valuations you got does not fairly represent the * market value of the property on the day you made the giftthe * GST inclusive market value (as reduced under subsection (4) if that subsection applies) of the property on the day you made the gift
(4) For the purposes of items 3 and 4 of the table in subsection (3), the * GST inclusive market values of the property in question are reduced by 1 / 11 if you would have been entitled to an * input tax credit if:
(a) you had * acquired the property at the time you made the gift; and
(b) your acquisition had been for a * creditable purpose.

30 ‑ 220 Reducing the amount you can deduct
(1) The amount you can deduct is reduced by a reasonable amount if:
(a) the terms and conditions on which the gift is made are such that the recipient:
(i) does not receive immediate custody and control of the property; or
(ii) does not have the unconditional right to retain custody and control of the property in perpetuity; or
(iii) does not obtain an immediate, indefeasible and unencumbered legal and equitable title to the property; or
(b) the custody, control or use of the property by the recipient is affected by an * arrangement entered into in respect of the making of the gift.
(2) In deciding what is a reasonable amount, have regard to the effect of those terms and conditions, or that * arrangement, on the * GST inclusive market value of the gift.

Joint ownership of property

30 ‑ 225 Gift of property by joint owners
If:
(a) you own property jointly with one or more other entities; and
(b) you and the other entities make a gift of the property; and
(c) you would have been able to deduct the gift under section 30 ‑ 15 because of item 4, 5 or 6 of the table in that section if you had made a gift of the property as sole owner of it;
you can deduct so much of the gift as is reasonable, having regard to your interest in the property.

You cannot deduct costs of providing entertainment. Nor can you deduct amounts for property that you use for providing entertainment. But there are exceptions.

Table of sections

32 ‑ 5 No deduction for entertainment expenses

32 ‑ 10 Meaning of entertainment

32 ‑ 15 No deduction for property used for providing entertainment

32 ‑ 5 No deduction for entertainment expenses
To the extent that you incur a loss or outgoing in respect of providing * entertainment, you cannot deduct it under section 8 ‑ 1. However, there are exceptions, which are set out in Subdivision 32 ‑ B.
Note 1: Under section 8 ‑ 1 you can deduct a loss or outgoing that you incur for the purpose of producing assessable income.
Note 2: If you have used your property in providing entertainment, you may not be able to deduct an amount for the property: see section 32 ‑ 15.
Note 3: Section 32 ‑ 75 deals with arrangements to avoid the operation of this section.

(b) accommodation or travel to do with providing entertainment by way of food, drink or * recreation.
(2) You are taken to provide entertainment even if business discussions or transactions occur.
Note: These are some examples of what is entertainment:
These are some examples of what is not entertainment:

32 ‑ 15 No deduction for property used for providing entertainment
To the extent that you use property in providing * entertainment, your use of the property is taken not to be for the * purpose of producing assessable income if section 32 ‑ 5 would stop you deducting a loss or outgoing if you incurred it in the income year in providing the entertainment.
Note: Under some provisions of this Act, in order to deduct an amount for your property, you must have used the property for the purpose of producing assessable income.

32 ‑ 20 The main exception—fringe benefits
Section 32 ‑ 5 does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing to the extent that you incur it in respect of providing * entertainment by way of * providing a * fringe benefit.
But this exception does not apply to the extent that the taxable value of the * fringe benefit is reduced under section 63A of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986.

Note 2: There are other exceptions for a loss or outgoing you incur in providing a benefit that would be a fringe benefit if it were not an exempt benefit: see items 1.6 and 1.7 of the table in section 32 ‑ 30.

Section 32 ‑ 5 does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing to the extent that you incur it in respect of providing * entertainment as described in column 2 of an item of a table in this Subdivision.

Subdivision 32 ‑ D — In ‑ house dining facilities (employer expenses table item 1.2)

Table of sections

32 ‑ 70 $30 is assessable for each meal provided to non ‑ employee in an in ‑ house dining facility

32 ‑ 70 $30 is assessable for each meal provided to non ‑ employee in an in ‑ house dining facility
(1) Your assessable income includes $30 for a meal you provide in an * in ‑ house dining facility in the income year to an individual other than your employee, but only if:
(a) you incur a loss or outgoing in respect of providing the meal; and
(b) because of item 1.2 of the table in section 32 ‑ 30, section 32 ‑ 5 does not stop you deducting the loss or outgoing under section 8 ‑ 1 (which deals with general deductions); and
(c) the loss or outgoing is one that you can deduct under section 8 ‑ 1 for the income year or some other income year.
(2) However, you can choose not to include in your assessable income $30 for each meal you provide in the * in ‑ house dining facility in the income year to an individual other than your employee.
Note: If you do choose, you cannot rely on item 1.2 of the table in section 32 ‑ 30 as a basis for deducting a loss or outgoing you incur in respect of providing a meal.
(3) You must choose by the day you lodge your * income tax return for the income year, or within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

Subdivision 32 ‑ E — Anti ‑ avoidance

Table of sections

32 ‑ 75 Commissioner may treat you as having incurred entertainment expense

32 ‑ 75 Commissioner may treat you as having incurred entertainment expense
If:
(a) you incur a loss or outgoing under an * arrangement; and
(b) someone provides * entertainment under the arrangement to you or someone else; and
(c) section 32 ‑ 5 would have stopped you deducting the loss or outgoing under section 8 ‑ 1 (which deals with general deductions) if you had incurred it in respect of providing that entertainment;
this Division applies to you as if you had incurred the loss or outgoing in providing that entertainment, to the extent (if any) that the Commissioner thinks reasonable.
Note: This means that section 32 ‑ 5 will prevent you from deducting the loss or outgoing under section 8 ‑ 1 unless an exception applies.
Example: A company pays $1,000 to sponsor a football game. Under the same arrangement, the company is given a viewing box at the game. To the extent the Commissioner thinks reasonable, he or she can treat the company as having incurred the $1,000 in providing entertainment.

(a) your employer; or
(b) a group consisting of your employer and one or more of your employer’s * associates.

Division 35 — Deferral of losses from non ‑ commercial business activities

Guide to Division 35

35 ‑ 1 What this Division is about
This Division prevents losses of individuals from non ‑ commercial business activities being offset against other assessable income in the year the loss is incurred. The loss is deferred.
It sets out an income requirement and a series of tests to determine whether a business activity is treated as being non ‑ commercial.
The deferred losses may be offset in later years against profits from the activity. They may also be offset against other income if the income requirement and one of the other tests are satisfied, or if the Commissioner exercises a discretion.

Operative provisions

35 ‑ 5 Object
(1) The object of this Division is to improve the integrity of the taxation system by:
(a) preventing losses from non ‑ commercial activities that are carried on as * businesses by individuals (alone or in partnership) being offset against other assessable income; and
(b) preventing pre ‑ business capital expenditure and post ‑ business capital expenditure by individuals (alone or in partnership) in relation to non ‑ commercial activities being deductible under section 40 ‑ 880 (business related costs);
unless certain exceptions apply.
(2) This Division is not intended to apply to activities that do not constitute carrying on a * business (for example, the receipt of income from passive investments).

35 ‑ 10 Deferral of deductions from non ‑ commercial business activities
(1) The rule in subsection (2) applies for an income year to each * business activity you carried on in that year if you are an individual, either alone or in partnership (whether or not some other entity is a member of the partnership), unless:
(a) you satisfy subsection (2E) for that year, and one of the tests set out in any of the following provisions is satisfied for the business activity for that year:
(i) section 35 ‑ 30 (assessable income test);
(ii) section 35 ‑ 35 (profits test);
(iii) section 35 ‑ 40 (real property test);
(iv) section 35 ‑ 45 (other assets test); or
(b) the Commissioner has exercised the discretion set out in section 35 ‑ 55 for the business activity for that year; or
(c) the exception in subsection (4) applies for that year.
Note: This section covers individuals carrying on a business activity as partners, but not individuals merely in receipt of income jointly. Compare the definition of partnership in subsection 995 ‑ 1(1).
Rules
(2) If the amounts attributable to the * business activity for that income year that you could otherwise deduct under this Act for that year exceed your assessable income (if any) from the business activity for that year, or your share of it, this Act applies to you as if the excess:
(a) were not incurred in that income year; and
(b) were an amount attributable to the activity that you can deduct from assessable income from the activity for the next income year in which the activity is carried on.
Note 1: There are modifications of this rule if you have exempt income (see section 35 ‑ 15) or you become bankrupt (see section 35 ‑ 20).
Note 2: This rule does not apply if your excess is solely due to deductions under Division 41 (see section 35 ‑ 10 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 ).
Example: Jennifer has a salaried job, and she also carries on a business activity consisting of selling lingerie.
Jennifer starts that activity on 1 July 2002, and for the 2002 ‑ 03 income year, the activity produces assessable income of $8,000 and deductions of $10,000. The activity does not pass any of the tests and the discretion is not exercised so the $2,000 excess is carried over to the next income year in which the activity is carried on.
For the 2003 ‑ 04 income year, the activity produces assessable income of $9,000 and deductions of $10,000 (excluding the $2,000 excess from 2002 ‑ 03). Again, no tests passed and no exercise of discretion.
$3,000 is carried over to the next income year (comprising the $1,000 excess for the current year, plus the previous year’s $2,000 excess) when the activity is carried on.
(2A) You cannot deduct an amount under section 40 ‑ 880 (business related costs) for expenditure in relation to a * business activity you used to carry on if you are an individual, either alone or in partnership (whether or not some other entity is a member of the partnership) unless:
(a) you satisfied subsection (2E), and one of the tests set out in any of the following provisions was satisfied for the business activity:
(i) section 35 ‑ 30 (assessable income test);
(ii) section 35 ‑ 35 (profits test);
(iii) section 35 ‑ 40 (real property test);
(iv) section 35 ‑ 45 (other assets test); or
(b) the Commissioner has exercised the discretion set out in section 35 ‑ 55 for the business activity; or
(c) the exception in subsection (4) applied;
for the income year in which the business activity ceased to be carried on or an earlier income year.
(2B) If you are an individual, either alone or in partnership (whether or not some other entity is a member of the partnership), you cannot deduct an amount under section 40 ‑ 880 (business related costs) for expenditure in relation to a * business activity:
(a) you propose to carry on; or
(b) another entity proposes to carry on if the other entity is not an individual, either alone or in partnership;
for an income year before the one in which the business activity starts to be carried on.
(2C) This section applies to an amount that you could have deducted, apart from paragraph (2B)(a), as if it were an amount attributable to the * business activity that you can deduct from assessable income from the activity for the income year in which the business activity starts to be carried on.
(2D) You can deduct expenditure covered by paragraph (2B)(b) for the income year in which the * business activity starts to be carried on.
Income requirement
(2E) You satisfy this subsection for an income year if the sum of the following is less than $250,000:
(a) your taxable income for that year, disregarding your * assessable FHSS released amount for that year;
(b) your * reportable fringe benefits total for that year;
(c) your * reportable superannuation contributions for that year;
(d) your * total net investment losses for that year.
For the purposes of paragraph (a), when working out your taxable income, disregard any excess mentioned in subsection (2) for any * business activity for that year that you could otherwise deduct under this Act for that year.
Grouping business activities
(3) In applying this Division, you may group together * business activities of a similar kind.
Exceptions
(4) The rule in subsection (2), (2A) or (2B) does not apply to a * business activity for an income year if:
(a) the activity is a * primary production business, or a * professional arts business; and
(b) your assessable income for that year (except any * net capital gain) from other sources that do not relate to that activity is less than $40,000.
(5) A professional arts business is a * business you carry on as:
(a) the author of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or
Note: The expression “author” is a technical term from copyright law. In general, the “author” of a musical work is its composer and the “author” of an artistic work is the artist, sculptor or photographer who created it.
(b) a * performing artist; or
(c) a * production associate.

35 ‑ 15 Modification if you have exempt income
(1) The rule in subsection 35 ‑ 10(2) may be modified for an income year if you * derived * exempt income in that year.
(2) Any amount to which paragraph 35 ‑ 10(2)(b) would otherwise apply for an income year for you is reduced by your * net exempt income for that year (after * utilising the net exempt income under section 36 ‑ 10 or 36 ‑ 15 (about tax losses)). This reduction is made before you apply the paragraph 35 ‑ 10(2)(b) amount against assessable income from the * business activity.

35 ‑ 20 Modification if you become bankrupt
(1) The rule in subsection 35 ‑ 10(2) or (2A) is modified as set out in subsection (3) for an income year if in that year (the current year ) you become bankrupt or are released from a debt by the operation of an Act relating to bankruptcy.
(2) The rule is also modified as set out in subsection (3) if:
(a) you became bankrupt before the current year; and
(b) the bankruptcy is annulled in the current year under section 74 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 because your creditors have accepted a proposal for a composition or scheme of arrangement; and
(c) under the composition or scheme of arrangement, you have been, will be or may be released from some or all of the debts from which you would have been released if you had instead been discharged from the bankruptcy.
(3) This Act applies to you as if any amount that:
(a) paragraph 35 ‑ 10(2)(b) had applied to for an income year before the current year for you; and
(b) you have not yet deducted;
were not an amount attributable to the * business activity that you can deduct for the current year or a later income year.

35 ‑ 25 Application of Division to certain partnerships
For the purpose of applying the tests in sections 35 ‑ 30, 35 ‑ 40 and 35 ‑ 45 where you carry on a * business activity in an income year as a partner, ignore:
(a) any part of the assessable income from the business activity for the year that is attributable to the interest of a partner that is not an individual in the partnership net income or partnership loss for the year; and
(b) any part of the assessable income from the business activity for the year that is * derived from the activity by another partner otherwise than as a member of the partnership; and
(c) any part of the * reduced cost bases or other values of assets of the partnership used in carrying on the activity in that year that is attributable to the interest of a partner that is not an individual in those assets; and
(d) any part of the reduced cost bases or other values of assets owned or leased by another partner that are not partnership assets and used in carrying on the activity in that year.

35 ‑ 30 Assessable income test
The rules in section 35 ‑ 10 do not apply to a * business activity for an income year if:
(a) the amount of assessable income from the business activity for the year; or
(b) you started to carry on the business activity, or stopped carrying it on, during the year—a reasonable estimate of what would have been the amount of that assessable income if you had carried on that activity throughout the year;
is at least $20,000.

35 ‑ 35 Profits test
(1) The rules in section 35 ‑ 10 do not apply to a * business activity (except an activity carried on by one or more individuals as partners, whether or not some other entity is a member of the partnership) for an income year (the current year ) if, for each of at least 3 of the past 5 income years (including the current year) the sum of the deductions attributable to that activity for that year (apart from the operation of subsections 35 ‑ 10(2) and (2C)) is less than the assessable income from the activity for that year.
(2) For a * business activity you carried on with one or more others as partners, the rules in section 35 ‑ 10 do not apply to you for the current year if, for each of at least 3 of the past 5 income years (including the current year) the sum of your deductions (including your share of the partnership deductions) attributable to that activity for that year (apart from the operation of subsections 35 ‑ 10(2) and (2C)) is less than your assessable income (including your share of the partnership’s assessable income) from the activity for that year.

35 ‑ 40 Real property test
(1) The rules in section 35 ‑ 10 do not apply to a * business activity for an income year if the total * reduced cost bases of real property or interests in real property used on a continuing basis in carrying on the activity in that year is at least $500,000.
(2) You may use the * market value of the real property or interest if that value is more than its * reduced cost base.
(3) The * reduced cost base or * market value is worked out:
(a) as at the end of the income year; or
(b) if you stopped carrying on the * business activity during the year:
(i) as at the time you stopped; or
(ii) if you disposed of the asset before that time in the course of stopping carrying on the activity—as at the time you disposed of it.
(4) However, these assets are not counted for this test:
(a) a * dwelling, and any adjacent land used in association with the dwelling, that is used mainly for private purposes;
(b) fixtures owned by you as a tenant.

35 ‑ 45 Other assets test
(1) The rules in section 35 ‑ 10 do not apply to a * business activity for an income year if the total values of assets that are counted for this test (see subsections (2) and (4)) and that are used on a continuing basis in carrying on the activity in that year is at least $100,000.
(2) The assets counted for this test, and their values for this test, are set out in this table:

The sum of the amounts of the future lease payments for the asset to which you are irrevocably committed, less an appropriate amount to reflect any interest component for those lease payments
4 Trade marks, patents, copyrights and similar rights
Their * reduced cost base
(3) The value of such an asset is worked out:
(a) as at the end of the income year; or
(b) if you stopped carrying on the * business activity during the year:
(i) as at the time you stopped; or
(ii) if you disposed of the asset before that time in the course of stopping carrying on the activity—as at the time you disposed of it.
(4) However, these assets are not counted for this test:
(a) assets that are real property or interests in real property that are taken into account for that year under section 35 ‑ 40;
(b) * cars, motor cycles and similar vehicles.

35 ‑ 50 Apportionment
If an asset that is being taken into account under section 35 ‑ 40 or 35 ‑ 45 is used during an income year partly in carrying on the relevant * business activity and partly for other purposes, only that part of its * reduced cost base, * market value or other value that is attributable to its use in carrying on the business activity in that year is taken into account for that section.

35 ‑ 55 Commissioner’s discretion
(1) The Commissioner may, on application, decide that the rule in subsection 35 ‑ 10(2) does not apply to a * business activity for one or more income years (the excluded years ) if the Commissioner is satisfied that it would be unreasonable to apply that rule because:
(a) the business activity was or will be affected in the excluded years by special circumstances outside the control of the operators of the business activity, including drought, flood, bushfire or some other natural disaster; or
Note: This paragraph is intended to provide for a case where a business activity would have satisfied one of the tests if it were not for the special circumstances.
(b) for an applicant who carries on the business activity who satisfies subsection 35 ‑ 10(2E) (income requirement) for the most recent income year ending before the application is made—the business activity has started to be carried on and, for the excluded years:
(i) because of its nature, it has not satisfied, or will not satisfy, one of the tests set out in section 35 ‑ 30, 35 ‑ 35, 35 ‑ 40 or 35 ‑ 45; and
(ii) there is an objective expectation, based on evidence from independent sources (where available) that, within a period that is commercially viable for the industry concerned, the activity will either meet one of those tests or will produce assessable income for an income year greater than the deductions attributable to it for that year (apart from the operation of subsections 35 ‑ 10(2) and (2C)); or
(c) for an applicant who carries on the business activity who does not satisfy subsection 35 ‑ 10(2E) (income requirement) for the most recent income year ending before the application is made—the business activity has started to be carried on and, for the excluded years:
(i) because of its nature, it has not produced, or will not produce, assessable income greater than the deductions attributable to it; and
(ii) there is an objective expectation, based on evidence from independent sources (where available) that, within a period that is commercially viable for the industry concerned, the activity will produce assessable income for an income year greater than the deductions attributable to it for that year (apart from the operation of subsections 35 ‑ 10(2) and (2C)).
Note: Paragraphs (b) and (c) are intended to cover a business activity that has a lead time between the commencement of the activity and the production of any assessable income. For example, an activity involving the planting of hardwood trees for harvest, where many years would pass before the activity could reasonably be expected to produce income.
(2) The Commissioner may, on application, decide that the rule in subsection 35 ‑ 10(2B) does not apply to a * business activity for an income year if the Commissioner is satisfied that it would be unreasonable to apply that rule because special circumstances of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a) of this section prevented the activity from starting.
Note: This subsection is intended to provide for a case where a business activity would have begun to be carried on and satisfied one of the tests if it were not for the special circumstances.
(3) An application for a decision by the Commissioner under this section must be made in the * approved form.

36 ‑ 25 Special rules about tax losses

36 ‑ 10 How to calculate a tax loss for an income year
(1) Add up the amounts you can deduct for an income year (except * tax losses for earlier income years).
(2) Subtract your total assessable income.
(3) If you * derived * exempt income, also subtract your * net exempt income (worked out under section 36 ‑ 20).
(4) Any amount remaining is your tax loss for the income year, which is called a loss year .
Note 1: Some deductions are limited so that they cannot contribute to a tax loss. See section 26 ‑ 55 (Limit on certain deductions).
Note 2: The meanings of tax loss and loss year are modified by section 36 ‑ 55 for a corporate tax entity that has an amount of excess franking offsets.
(5) For subsection (3), if you have * exempt income under section 51 ‑ 100 (about shipping), disregard 90% of so much of your * net exempt income as directly relates to that exempt income.

36 ‑ 15 How to deduct tax losses of entities other than corporate tax entities
(1) Your * tax loss for a * loss year is deducted in a later income year as follows if you are not a * corporate tax entity at any time during the later income year.
Note 1: See section 36 ‑ 17 for the deduction of a tax loss of an entity that is a corporate tax entity at any time during the later income year.
Note 2: A tax loss can be deducted only to the extent that it has not already been utilised: see subsection 960 ‑ 20(1).
If you have no net exempt income
(2) If your total assessable income for the later income year exceeds your total deductions (other than * tax losses), you deduct the tax loss from that excess.
If you have net exempt income
(3) If you have * net exempt income for the later income year and your total assessable income (if any) for the later income year exceeds your total deductions (except * tax losses), you deduct the tax loss:
(a) first, from your net exempt income; and
(b) secondly, from the part of your total assessable income that exceeds those deductions.
(4) However, if you have * net exempt income for the later income year and those deductions exceed your total assessable income, then:
(a) subtract that excess from your net exempt income; and
(b) deduct the tax loss from any net exempt income that remains.
To work out your net exempt income: see section 36 ‑ 20.
General
(5) If you have 2 or more * tax losses, you deduct them in the order in which you incurred them.

36 ‑ 17 How to deduct tax losses of corporate tax entities
(1) A * tax loss of an entity for a * loss year is deducted in a later income year as follows if the entity is a * corporate tax entity at any time during the later income year.
Note 1: A tax loss can be deducted under this section only to the extent that it has not already been utilised: see subsection 960 ‑ 20(1).
Note 2: A corporate tax entity may also, in the 2020 ‑ 21, 2021 ‑ 22 or 2022 ‑ 23 income year, be able to carry a loss back to the 2018 ‑ 19, 2019 ‑ 20, 2020 ‑ 21 or 2021 ‑ 2022 income year: see Division 160.
If the entity has no net exempt income
(2) If the entity’s total assessable income for the later income year exceeds the entity’s total deductions (except * tax losses), the entity is to deduct from that excess so much of the tax loss as the entity chooses. The entity may choose a nil amount.
If the entity has net exempt income
(3) If the entity has * net exempt income for the later income year and the entity’s total assessable income (if any) for that year exceeds the entity’s total deductions (except * tax losses), the entity is to:
(a) first, deduct the tax loss from the net exempt income; and
(b) secondly, deduct from the part of the total assessable income that exceeds those deductions so much of the undeducted amount of the tax loss (if any) as the entity chooses.
The entity may choose a nil amount under paragraph (b).
Note: To work out the corporate tax entity’s net exempt income: see section 36 ‑ 20.
(4) However, if the entity has * net exempt income for the later income year and those deductions exceed the entity’s total assessable income, the entity is to:
(a) subtract that excess from the net exempt income; and
(b) deduct the * tax loss from any net exempt income that remains.
Note: This means there is no choice available under this subsection.
(4A) For subsection (3) or (4), if the entity has * exempt income under section 51 ‑ 100 (about shipping) for the later income year, disregard 90% of so much of the entity’s * net exempt income for the later income year as directly relates to that exempt income.
Limit to how much the entity can choose
(5) The choice that the entity has under subsection (2) or (3) for the later income year is subject to both of the following:
(a) the entity must choose a nil amount if, disregarding the * tax loss and other tax losses of the entity, the entity would have an amount of * excess franking offsets for that year;
(b) if, disregarding the tax loss and other tax losses of the entity, the entity would not have an amount of excess franking offsets for that year—the entity must not choose an amount that would result in the entity having an amount of excess franking offsets for that year.
Example: For the 2017 ‑ 18 income year, Company A (which is not a base rate entity) has:
The tax offset of $30 from the franking credit is not stated in Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules.
Company A would not have an amount of excess franking offsets for that year if the tax loss were disregarded (see section 36 ‑ 55). This is because the tax offset of $30 is less than $60, the amount of income tax that Company A would have to pay if it did not have the tax offset and the tax loss. Paragraph (a) therefore does not apply.
If Company A chooses to deduct the full amount of the tax loss, it would have an amount of excess franking offsets of $15:
Company A therefore cannot make this choice because of paragraph (b).
However, if Company A chooses to deduct $100 of the tax loss, it would not have an amount of excess franking offsets:
Company A therefore can choose to deduct $100 of the tax loss.
(6) The entity must state its choice under subsection (2) or (3) in its * income tax return for the later income year.
General
(7) If the entity has 2 or more * tax losses, the entity is to deduct them in the order in which the entity incurred them.
Recalculation of amounts resulting in a choice or a change of a choice
(10) Subsection (11) or (12) applies if at least one of the following amounts is recalculated after an entity has lodged its * income tax return for an income year:
(a) the amount of a * tax loss that the entity can * utilise in that year;
(b) the amount of the difference between the entity’s total assessable income for that year and the entity’s total deductions (other than * tax losses) for that year;
(c) the amount of the entity’s * net exempt income for that year;
whether or not the amount is recalculated in an amendment of the entity’s assessment for that year, and whether or not the amount was a nil amount before the recalculation (or has become a nil amount after the recalculation).
(11) If:
(a) before the recalculation, a choice under subsection (2) or (3) for the income year was not available to the entity; but
(b) as a result of the recalculation, the choice has (apart from subsection (6)) become available to the entity;
the entity can make that choice by written notice given to the Commissioner.
(12) If:
(a) the entity made a choice under subsection (2) or (3) for the income year; but
(b) as a result of the recalculation, the entity wishes to change that choice;
the entity can do so by written notice given to the Commissioner.
(13) Subsections (10) to (12) have effect subject to section 170 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (about amendment of assessments).

36 ‑ 20 Net exempt income
(1) If you are an Australian resident, your net exempt income is the amount by which your total * exempt income from all sources exceeds the total of:
(a) the losses and outgoings (except capital losses and outgoings) you incurred in deriving that exempt income; and
(b) any taxes payable outside Australia on that exempt income.
(2) If you are a foreign resident, your net exempt income is the amount (if any) by which the total of:
(a) your * exempt income * derived from sources in Australia; and
(b) your exempt income to which section 26AG (Certain film proceeds included in assessable income) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 applies;
exceeds the total of:

36 ‑ 35 No deduction for tax loss incurred before bankruptcy
(1) If:
(a) you became bankrupt; or
(b) you were released from a debt by the operation of an Act relating to bankruptcy;
before the income year, you cannot deduct a * tax loss that you incurred before the day on which you either became bankrupt or were released.
(2) If:
(a) you became bankrupt before the income year; and
(b) the bankruptcy is later annulled under section 74 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 because your creditors have accepted your proposal for a composition or scheme of arrangement; and
(c) under the composition or scheme of arrangement, you have been, will be or may be released from some or all of the debts from which you would have been released if you had instead been discharged from the bankruptcy;
you cannot deduct a * tax loss that you incurred before the day on which you became bankrupt.

36 ‑ 40 Deduction for amounts paid for debts incurred before bankruptcy
Tax losses generally
(1) If:
(a) you pay an amount in the income year for a debt that you incurred in an earlier income year; and
(b) you have a * tax loss covered by section 36 ‑ 35 for that earlier income year;
you can deduct the amount paid, but only to the extent that it does not exceed so much of the debt as the Commissioner is satisfied was taken into account in calculating the amount of the tax loss.

(2) If:
(a) you pay an amount in the income year for a debt that you incurred in an earlier income year; and
(b) you incurred the debt in the course of deriving or gaining * assessable film income or * exempt film income; and

you can deduct the amount paid, but only to the extent that it does not exceed so much of the debt as the Commissioner is satisfied was taken into account in calculating the amount of the film loss.
(3) A film loss is the * film component (if any) of a * tax loss.
(4) Your * tax loss for an income year has a film component if your * film deductions for the year exceed the sum of:
(a) your * assessable film income for the year; and
(b) your * net exempt film income for the year.
The amount of the film component is the excess or the tax loss, whichever is lesser.
(5) However, if your * tax loss worked out under a provision listed in the table, the film component is what that tax loss would have been if:
(a) your * film deductions for the * loss year had been your only deductions; and
(b) your * assessable film income for the loss year had been your only assessable income; and
(c) your * net exempt film income for the loss year had been your only * net exempt income.

Subdivision 36 ‑ C — Excess franking offsets

Guide to Subdivision 36 ‑ C

36 ‑ 50 What this Subdivision is about
Amounts of tax offsets to which a corporate tax entity is entitled under Division 207 and Subdivision 210 ‑ H may in some circumstances be converted into an amount of a tax loss for the entity.
Table of sections
Operative provision

36 ‑ 55 Converting excess franking offsets into tax loss
Operative provision

36 ‑ 55 Converting excess franking offsets into tax loss
Excess franking offsets
(1) An entity that is a * corporate tax entity at any time during an income year has an amount of excess franking offsets for that year if:
(a) the total amount of * tax offsets to which the entity is entitled for that year under Division 207 and Subdivision 210 ‑ H (except those that are subject to the refundable tax offset rules because of section 67 ‑ 25);
exceeds:
(b) the amount of income tax that the entity would have to pay on its taxable income for that year if:
(i) it did not have those tax offsets; and
(ii) it did not have any tax offsets that are subject to the tax offset carry forward rules or the refundable tax offset rules; and
(iii) it did not have any tax offset under section 205 ‑ 70;
but had all its other tax offsets.
The excess is the amount of excess franking offsets .
Note: Division 65 sets out the tax offset carry forward rules. Division 67 sets out which tax offsets are subject to the refundable tax offset rules.
Example: For the 2017 ‑ 18 income year, Company E (which is not a base rate entity) has:
The tax offset of $60 from the franking credit is not stated in Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules.
Disregarding the tax offset of $60 from the franking credit, the amount of income tax that Company E would have to pay is $30:
This amount is $30 less than the tax offset of $60. Company E therefore has an amount of excess franking offsets of $30 for that year.
How to work out the amount of the tax loss
(2) For the purposes of this Act, if:
(a) an entity has an amount of * excess franking offsets for an income year; and
(b) the result of applying the following method statement is a positive amount;
then:
(c) the entity is taken to have a * tax loss for that year equal to that positive amount (instead of an amount of tax loss worked out under section 36 ‑ 10, 165 ‑ 70, 175 ‑ 35 or 701 ‑ 30); and
(d) that year is taken to be a * loss year for the entity if the entity would not otherwise have a tax loss for that year.
Method statement
Step 1. Work out the amount (if any) that would have been the entity’s * tax loss for that year under section 36 ‑ 10, 165 ‑ 70, 175 ‑ 35 or 701 ‑ 30 if the entity’s * net exempt income for that year (if any) were disregarded.
Note: See section 36 ‑ 20 for the calculation of net exempt income.
Step 2. Divide the amount of * excess franking offsets by the entity’s * corporate tax rate for imputation purposes for that year.
Step 3. Add the results of steps 1 and 2.
Step 4. Reduce the result of step 3 by the entity’s * net exempt income for that year (if any).
The result of this step is taken to be the entity’s * tax loss for that year. However, if the result of this step is nil or a negative amount, the company does not have any tax loss for that year.
Example: Assume that company E did not derive any exempt income for the 2017 ‑ 2018 income year and that it would not otherwise have any tax loss for that year under section 36 ‑ 10, 165 ‑ 70, 175 ‑ 35 or 701 ‑ 30.
Applying the method statement, the amount of excess franking offsets of $30 generates a tax loss of $100 for that year, which can be deducted in a later income year under section 36 ‑ 15 or 36 ‑ 17.
