[31. Deleted: Act No. 15 of 2010 s. 37.]

32. Business kilometres, methods for calculating

(a) has not previously paid a vehicle allowance for the vehicle; or
(b) has been using only the averaging method for the vehicle for 5 years and has not completed a further continuous recording period; or
(c) the Commissioner gives the employer a direction under regulation 36.

(a) the employer has used the continuous recording method for the vehicle for at least 12 consecutive weeks immediately before changing to the averaging method; and
(b) the employer has kept a record of the vehicle’s odometer readings at the beginning and end of the continuous recording period; and

(2) To establish the BK percentage, the employer must —
(a) select a recording period of at least 12 consecutive weeks under regulation 36; and
(b) determine the number of business kilometres travelled by the vehicle during the recording period using the records of the odometer readings made during the recording period; and
(c) calculate the percentage of the kilometres travelled during the recording period that were business kilometres in accordance with the following formula —
where —
BK is the number of business kilometres travelled by the vehicle in the recording period; and
TK is the total number of kilometres travelled by the vehicle in the recording period.
(3) When the BK percentage has been established, the average number of business kilometres travelled by the vehicle during a return period is calculated using the following formula —
where —
Average BK is the average number of business kilometres travelled by the vehicle in the recording period; and
BK% is the BK percentage established under subregulation (2); and
TK is the total number of kilometres travelled by the vehicle in the return period based on records of the vehicle’s odometer readings made by the employer at the beginning and end of the return period.

(b) the employer uses the continuous recording method to determine the number of business kilometres travelled by the vehicle.
(2) If an employer is directed by the Commissioner to select another recording period, the period must be selected from the current period in which the employer has been using the continuous recording method.

37. Replacing one motor vehicle with another
(1) If a person who is paid a motor vehicle allowance ceases to use a motor vehicle for business journeys and commences using another motor vehicle in its place, the employer may nominate the second motor vehicle as a replacement for the first.
(2) When a nomination has been made under subregulation (1) —
(a) the replacement motor vehicle is to be treated as the original motor vehicle; and
(b) if the employer is using the averaging method, the employer may continue to do so until the employer would have been required to revert to the continuous recording method under another provision of these regulations even if the original vehicle had not been replaced; and
(c) the employer must —
(i) record the odometer readings of both vehicles at the time of the replacement; and
(ii) take those readings into account when calculating the number of kilometres travelled during the return period in which the replacement occurred.
(3) The employer must record the nomination in writing during the return period in which the replacement occurs.
(4) The employer must retain all records made under this regulation for 5 years from the end of the last return period during which any allowance relating to journeys made before the replacement is paid.
