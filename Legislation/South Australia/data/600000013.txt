Part 3A—Transfer of estate assets and liabilities

25 A—Interpretation
(1)	In this Part—
ASIC means the Australian Securities and Investments Commission;
authorised ASIC officer means a person authorised under section 25D to issue certificates under that section;
certificate of transfer—see section 25B(2);
receiving company—see section 25B(2);
State tax means—
(a)	stamp duty; or
(b)	any other tax, duty or impost that would, apart from an exemption under this Part, be payable in respect of the transaction under the law of the State;
transferring company—see section 25B(2).
(2)	If an expression is defined in the Commonwealth Act and is also used in this Part, the expression as used in this Part has, unless the contrary intention appears, the same meaning as in that Act.

25 B—Purpose and application of Part
(1)	The purpose of this Part is to facilitate transfers of estate assets and liabilities under Part 5D.6 of the Commonwealth Act.
(2)	This Part applies if ASIC—
(a)	makes a determination under section 601WBA of the Commonwealth Act that there is to be a transfer of estate assets and liabilities from a specified trustee company (the transferring company) to another trustee company (the receiving company); and
(b)	issues a certificate of transfer under section 601WBG of the Commonwealth Act stating that the transfer is to take effect.
Note—
Section 601WBA of the Commonwealth Act enables ASIC to make a transfer determination if—
(a)	ASIC cancels the licence of the transferring company (in which case the determination is a compulsory transfer determination); or
(b)	the transferring company applies to ASIC for a transfer determination (in which case the determination is a voluntary transfer determination).

25 C—Transfer of transferring company's estate assets and liabilities
(1)	From the time a certificate of transfer comes into force in respect of the transfer of estate assets and liabilities from a transferring company to a receiving company, the receiving company is to be taken to be the successor in law of the transferring company, to the extent of the transfer.
(2)	If the transfer of estate assets and liabilities is a total transfer, all the assets and liabilities of the transferring company become respectively the assets and liabilities of the receiving company without any transfer, conveyance or assignment.
(3)	If the transfer of estate assets and liabilities is a partial transfer, all the assets and liabilities of the transferring company that are included in the list (referred to in section 601WBG(2)(c) of the Commonwealth Act) included in, or attached to, the certificate of transfer become respectively assets and liabilities of the receiving company without any transfer, conveyance or assignment.
(4)	To the extent of the transfer of estate assets and liabilities, the duties, obligations, immunities, rights and privileges applying to the transferring company apply to the receiving company and, in particular—
(a)	an appointment of the transferring company in a will, order of a court or instrument of any kind is to be taken to be an appointment of the receiving company (whether the appointment was made before, on or after the commencement of this Part and whether the appointment is in effect on that date, takes effect after that date or has taken effect previously but some further act or thing is necessary to perfect the appointment or undertaking of the office); and
(b)	in each case where the transferring company is acting as a trustee, the receiving company is appointed as the trustee in place of the transferring company and the receiving company—
(i)	is entitled to exercise any rights, powers, capacities or authorities in respect of or arising from each such appointment; and
(ii)	to the extent provided in this Act, is obliged to discharge the liabilities and obligations of the transferring company in respect of and arising from each such appointment.
(5)	If the certificate of transfer includes provisions of a kind referred to in section 601WBG(3) of the Commonwealth Act—
(a)	specifying that particular things are to happen or are taken to be the case, those things are taken to happen, or to be the case, in accordance with those provisions; or
(b)	specifying a mechanism for determining things that are to happen or are taken to be the case, things determined in accordance with that mechanism are taken to happen, or to be the case, as determined in accordance with that mechanism.

25 D—Certificates evidencing operation of Part
(1)	An authorised ASIC officer may, by a certificate in writing signed by the officer, certify that a specified asset or liability of the transferring company has become an asset or liability of the receiving company under this Part.
(2)	For all purposes and in all proceedings, a certificate purporting to be issued under subsection (1) is evidence of the matters certified.
(3)	ASIC is empowered to authorise, in writing, a person who is a member of ASIC, or of its staff, to issue certificates under this section.

25 E—Registration or record of transfer
The Registrar‑General or any other person or authority required or authorised under a law of the State to register or record transactions affecting assets or liabilities, or documents relating to such transactions, must, on application under this section accompanied by a certificate issued under section 25D, register or record in an appropriate manner the transfer or transfers to which the certificate relates.

25 F—Exemption from State taxes
No State taxes are chargeable under any Act in respect of a transfer of estate assets or liabilities facilitated under this Part.

25 H—Relationship of Part with other laws
(1)	This Part has effect despite anything in a contract, deed, undertaking, agreement, will or other instrument.
(2)	Nothing done by or under this Part—
(a)	places a receiving company, a transferring company or another person in breach of contract or confidence or otherwise makes any of them guilty of a civil wrong; or
(b)	places a receiving company, a transferring company or another person in breach of—
(i)	a law of the State; or
(ii)	a contractual provision prohibiting, restricting or regulating the assignment or transfer of an asset or liability or the disclosure of information; or
(c)	releases a surety, wholly or partly, from all or any of the surety's obligations.
(3)	Without limiting subsection (1), if, apart from this section, the advice or consent of a person would be necessary in a particular respect, the advice is taken to have been obtained or the consent is taken to have been given.

Part 4—Miscellaneous

26—False or misleading statements
A trustee company must not make or include in any document required by or for the purposes of this Act any statement that is false or misleading in a material particular.
Maximum penalty: $20 000.

28—Evidentiary provision

is, notwithstanding any other law, sufficient evidence that the company is authorised to act as executor of the will, or administrator of the estate, of the deceased person, or in that other capacity.
(3)	A certificate under subsection (2) is equivalent, for registration purposes, to the probate, letters of administration, trust instrument or other order or document of appointment.

29—Act not to affect other Acts or remedies
(1)	The provisions of this Act are in addition to, and do not derogate from, the provisions of any other Act.
(2)	Nothing in this Act derogates from any right of action or other right or remedy that a person has apart from this Act.
