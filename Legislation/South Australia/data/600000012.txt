(2)	This section applies to investments made before or after the commencement of the Trustee (Investment Powers) Amendment Act 1995.

(c)	whether the trust investments have been made pursuant to an investment strategy formulated in accordance with the duty of a trustee under this Part; and
(d)	the extent the trustee acted on the independent and impartial advice of a person competent (or apparently competent) to give the advice.

13 D—Power of court to set off gains and losses arising from investment
(1)	The court may, when considering an action for breach of trust arising out of or in respect of an investment by a trustee where a loss has been or is expected to be sustained by the trust, set off all or part of the loss resulting from that investment against all or part of the gain resulting from any other investment whether in breach of trust or not.
(2)	The power of set off conferred by subsection (1) is in addition to any other power or entitlement to set off all or part of any loss against any property.
