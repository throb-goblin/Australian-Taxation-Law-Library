13—Duties of Minister and Registrar-General
(1)	Where the land sold is under the Real Property Act 1886, the transfer shall, after payment to the Minister of the purchase money payable and of the necessary fees and charges for the stamping and registration of the transfer, be executed by the Minister and shall be in the Form No 3 in the Schedule, or in a form to the like effect.

(2)	Where the land sold is not under the Real Property Act 1886—
(a)	the conveyance shall, after payment to the Minister of the purchase money payable and of the necessary fees for stamping the conveyance and the other fees and charges necessary to be paid as provided by subsection (3), be executed by the Minister;

(3)	The Registrar-General shall, on receipt of any such conveyance and request and upon payment of such fees and charges as would have been payable if the request had been an application to bring the land conveyed under the Real Property Act 1886 and without any further evidence of title or the necessity of publishing any notice of the said request, forthwith issue to the purchaser a certificate of title as aforesaid.
Before issuing a certificate of title as aforesaid the Registrar-General may require the Director of Lands to deposit with him a plan or map of the land conveyed, as if the request had been an application to bring the land conveyed under the Real Property Act 1886.

(5)	If any land so sold is comprised in a limited certificate of title within the meaning of the Real Property (Registration of Titles) Act 1945, and issued pursuant to that Act, the Registrar-General may, before issuing therefor an ordinary certificate of title within the meaning of that Act, require the deposit of such plans of survey or otherwise as he deems necessary.
