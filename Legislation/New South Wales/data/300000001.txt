An Act to provide for the administration and operation of State taxing laws that are applied as Commonwealth laws in relation to Commonwealth places; and for related purposes.

Part 2 Administration and operation of State taxing laws as applied laws in relation to Commonwealth places

5 Arrangements with Commonwealth
(1) The Governor may make an arrangement with the Governor-General of the Commonwealth in relation to the exercise or performance of a power, duty or function (not being a power, duty or function involving the exercise of judicial power) by a State authority under an applied law.
(2) The Governor may arrange with the Governor-General for the variation or revocation of an arrangement made under this section.
For an arrangement under this section see Commonwealth Gazette No GN 7 of 20.2.2002, p 590

6 Exercise of powers etc by State authorities

7 Modified operation of State taxing laws
(1) If, in relation to a State taxing law, there is a corresponding applied law, the State taxing law is to be read and construed with any modifications that are necessary or convenient:
for the purpose of enabling the effective operation of the State taxing law in conjunction with the corresponding applied law, orfor the purpose of enabling the State taxing law to operate so that a taxpayer has a combined liability under:
the State taxing law, andthe corresponding applied law,
that is as nearly as possible the same as the taxpayer’s liability would be under the State taxing law alone if the Commonwealth places in the State were not Commonwealth places.
(2) Regulations may prescribe particular modifications that are to have effect under subsection (1).
(3) Modifications prescribed under subsection (2):
may be expressed to take effect from a day that is earlier than the day on which the regulations are published in the Gazette (but not earlier than 6 October 1997), andmay deal with the circumstances in which the modifications apply, and with matters of a transitional or savings nature.
