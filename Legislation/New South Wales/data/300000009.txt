3A Special trust—meaning
(1) For the purposes of this Act, a trust is a special trust if—
the trust property includes land, andthe trustee of the trust is the owner of the legal estate in the land, andthe trust is not a fixed trust.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a trust is a fixed trust if the equitable estate in all of the land that is the subject of the trust is owned by a person or persons who are owners of the land for land tax purposes (disregarding section 25 (3)).
(3) For the purpose of determining whether a trust is a fixed trust under this section, any equitable interest of the trustee as trustee of the trust is to be disregarded.
(3A)

If a trust satisfies the relevant criteria, the persons who are beneficiaries of the trust under the trust deed are taken to be owners of an equitable estate in the land that is the subject of the trust and, accordingly, the trust is taken to be a fixed trust.
Under section 25, owners of an equitable estate or interest in land are liable in respect of land tax as if they were legal owners of the land. Owners of an equitable estate in land are treated as secondary taxpayers.
(3B)

For the purposes of this section, the relevant criteria are as follows—
the trust deed specifically provides that the beneficiaries of the trust—
are presently entitled to the income of the trust, subject only to payment of proper expenses by and of the trustee relating to the administration of the trust, andare presently entitled to the capital of the trust, and may require the trustee to wind up the trust and distribute the trust property or the net proceeds of the trust property,
the entitlements referred to in paragraph (a) cannot be removed, restricted or otherwise affected by the exercise of any discretion, or by a failure to exercise any discretion, conferred on a person by the trust deed,
if the trust is a unit trust—
there must be only one class of units issued, andthe proportion of trust capital to which a unit holder is entitled on a winding up or surrender of units must be fixed and must be the same as the proportion of income of the trust to which the unit holder is entitled.
(4) A trust is not a special trust —
if the trust is solely a charitable trust, orif clause 9 of Schedule 1A applies in respect of the land that is the subject of the trust, orif the trust is a concessional trust, orin relation to any land tax year in which it is a superannuation trust, orif the trust is established by will, but only during the period ending on the expiration of 2 years after the date of death of the testator, orin relation to any land tax year in which it is a family unit trust, as provided by Schedule 1AA.
(5) For the purposes of this section, a trust is a superannuation trust in relation to a land tax year if—
the trust was established on or before 30 June in the year before that land tax year and, in relation to the year of income ending in that year, the trust is—
a complying superannuation fund (within the meaning of section 42 or 42A of the Commonwealth Act), ora complying approved deposit fund (within the meaning of section 43 of the Commonwealth Act), ora pooled superannuation trust (within the meaning of section 44 of the Commonwealth Act), orthe trust was established after 30 June in the year before that land tax year and, as at midnight on 31 December in that year, the trust is—
a regulated superannuation fund (within the meaning of the Commonwealth Act) or is taken to be a regulated superannuation fund under that Act, oran approved deposit fund (within the meaning of the Commonwealth Act), ora pooled superannuation trust (within the meaning of the Commonwealth Act).
(6) Despite anything to the contrary in this section, a trust is taken to be a special trust in relation to a land tax year if the trust is classified as a special trust in respect of that land tax year under section 25A, and the classification has effect in respect of that land tax year.
(7) In this section—
Commonwealth Act means the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 of the Commonwealth.

a person under the age of 18 years, ora person in respect of whom a guardianship order is in force under the Guardianship Act 1987 , ora person in the relevant group within the meaning of the Coroners Act 2009 .
(2) For the purposes of this section, a person is a beneficiary of a trust if the person is a person, or a member of a class of persons—
in whose favour, by the terms of the trust, capital or income the subject of the trust may be applied—
in the event of the exercise of a power or discretion in favour of the person, orin the event that a discretion conferred under the trust is not exercised, orentitled or permitted, under the terms of the trust, to use and occupy land that is the subject of the trust.

Part 3 Land tax

7 Land tax on taxable value of land
Land tax at such rates as may be fixed by any Act is to be levied and paid on the taxable value of all land situated in New South Wales which is owned by taxpayers (other than land which is exempt from taxation under this Act).
s 7: Am 1981 No 119, Sch 1; 1985 No 147, Sch 1 (2). Subst 1992 No 84, Sch 1 (2); 2006 No 50, Sch 3 [1].

8 Date of ownership for purposes of land tax
Land tax shall be charged on land as owned at midnight on the thirty-first day of December immediately preceding the year for which the land tax is levied.
In this section year means the period of twelve months commencing on the first day of January.
s 8: Am 1973 No 70, sec 3 (a).

9 Taxable value
(1) Land tax is payable by the owner of land on the taxable value of all the land owned by that owner which is not exempt from taxation under this Act.
(2) The taxable value of that land is the total sum of the average value of each parcel of that land.
(3) The average value of a parcel of land is to be calculated, as provided for by section 9AA, on the basis of the land value of the land.
(4) The land value of land, in relation to a land tax year, is the value entered in the Register as the land value of the land as at 1 July in the previous year.
(5) The fact that there is no land value entered in the Register on 31 December in a year as the land value of the land as at 1 July in that year does not prevent land tax being levied and charged and becoming payable for any following tax year once that land value is entered in the Register and the average value is ascertained.
s 9: Am 1960 No 35, sec 2 (1) (a); 1961 No 32, sec 2; 1963 No 40, sec 2 (a); 1964 No 40, sec 2; 1965 No 33, First Sch (am GG No 120 of 4.11.1966, p 4516 (as on and from 14.2.1966)); 1967 No 59, sec 2 (1); 1968 No 62, sec 2 (b); 1969 No 69, sec 2 (b); 1970 No 64, sec 2 (a); 1971 No 48, sec 2 (a); 1972 No 75, sec 3; 1973 No 70, sec 4; 1975 No 97, Sch 3 (1); 1981 No 119, Sch 1; 1983 No 14, Sch 1 (5); 1983 No 171, Sch 1 (2); 1984 No 129, Sch 1 (1); 1985 No 147, Sch 1 (2); 1988 No 128, Sch 1 (3). Subst 1992 No 84, Sch 1 (3). Am 1997 No 37, Sch 3 [1]; 1998 No 79, Sch 2.3 [2]; 2000 No 106, Sch 3 [2]; 2006 No 50, Sch 3 [2].

9AA Average value of land
(1) For the purposes of this Act, the average value of a parcel of land is the average of the land value of the land in relation to the year for which the average value is being ascertained (the current land tax year ) and the land value of the land in relation to the 2 preceding land tax years (the preceding land tax years ).
(2) If a land value adjustment is required in relation to a parcel in the current land tax year, the average value is to be determined before that land value adjustment is made (that is, on the basis of the land value without that land value adjustment) and, despite any other provision of this Act, the Valuation of Land Act 1916 or the Heritage Act 1977 , the land value adjustment is to be applied, for the purpose of assessing land tax, to the average value of the land for that land tax year (and not the land value).
(3) For the purposes of this section, a land value adjustment is—
a land value reduction , being any reduction that is required to be made to the land value of land under this Act for the purpose of assessing land tax, ora special allowance , being any allowance made in respect of the land value of land under Division 3 or 4 of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 .
(4) In the case of a land value reduction, the land value adjustment is to be applied to the average value of land by applying any provision of this Act that specifies that the land value is to be reduced for the purpose of assessing land tax as if a reference to the land value of land were a reference to the average value of land.
For example, the reductions provided for by sections 9A, 9BA, 9C, 9D, 9E, 10 (2), (2A) and (2C), 10Q (4) and 10R (3) will now apply to the average value of the land in a land tax year and not to the land value of the land.
(5)
(6) In the case of a special allowance, the land value adjustment is to be applied to the average value of the land by deducting the allowance from the average value.
(7) If a parcel of land did not exist on 31 December immediately before either or both of the preceding land tax years, the average value of the land is taken to be—
if the parcel did exist on 31 December immediately before one of the preceding land tax years—the average of the land value of the land in relation to the current land tax year and the land value of the land in relation to the preceding land tax year immediately before which it did exist, orin any other case—the land value of the land in relation to the current land tax year.
(8) Subsection (2) applies in relation to an average value determined as provided for by subsection (7) in the same way as it applies to an average value determined as provided for by subsection (1).
For example, if the newly created parcel qualifies for an allowance for subdivision under Division 4 of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 in the current land tax year, the allowance would be applied to the average value calculated as provided for by subsection (7).
(9) The average value of a parcel of land that is heritage-protected, and that was not heritage-protected on 31 December immediately before either or both of the preceding land tax years, is to be determined as provided for by subsection (7) (as if the parcel did not exist on the date or dates of 31 December on which it was not heritage-protected).
(10) If the land value of land in relation to a land tax year is altered (whether as a result of being reascertained or on objection or appeal or for the correction of a clerical error or misdescription), the average value of the land must be reascertained on the basis of the altered land value.
(11) If the average value of a parcel of land, after applying a land value adjustment, is less than zero, the average value of the parcel is taken to be zero.
(12) For the purposes of this section, land is heritage-protected if it is either heritage restricted (within the meaning of section 14G of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 ) or the subject of a heritage valuation under Division 6 of Part 6 of the Heritage Act 1977 , or both.
s 9AA: Ins 2006 No 50, Sch 3 [3]. Am 2006 No 87, Sch 2 [4]–[7]; 2020 No 19, Sch 3[1].

9A Concession for unutilised land value
(1) This section applies to land if an unutilised value allowance (as ascertained under Division 3 of Part 7) is entered in the Register in respect of the land.
(2) For the purpose of assessing land tax, the land value of the land is to be reduced by the unutilised value allowance.
(3) However, if the land is sold or otherwise disposed of or it ceases to be used or occupied solely as the site of a single dwelling-house, a person whose liability to pay land tax in respect of the land has been assessed in accordance with this section must, within 1 month, inform the Chief Commissioner of the date on which the land was sold or otherwise disposed of or ceased to be so used or occupied.
(4) Liability for land tax in respect of the year in which the land is sold, disposed of, or ceases to be used or occupied solely as the site of a single dwelling-house, and in each of the preceding years (up to a maximum of 4 preceding years) in which the person’s liability to pay land tax was assessed in accordance with this section is to be reassessed as if subsection (2) had not applied to the land.
(5) For the purposes of section 9 (3) (c) of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 , any such reassessment is authorised to be made more than 5 years after the initial assessment.
(6) Any such re-assessment is not a relevant land tax assessment for the purposes of section 35 (1) (b) of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 if it is based on the same land value or average value on which the original land tax assessment was based (before the reduction was made under subsection (2) of this section).
(7) In this section, single dwelling-house has the same meaning as in Division 2 of Part 8 of Chapter 15 of the Local Government Act 1993 .

9B Strata
(1) Land tax, in the case of land subject to the Strata Schemes Development Act 2015 , is to be levied and paid in respect of each lot comprised in a parcel.
(2) For the purposes of this Act—
the land value of a lot comprised in a parcel is an amount that bears to the land value of the parcel (within the meaning of section 9 (4)) the same proportion as the unit entitlement of the lot bears to the aggregate unit entitlement, andthe average value of the lot is to be ascertained on the basis of the land value of the lot, as determined under paragraph (a).
(3) Expressions used in this section have the same meanings as in the Strata Schemes Development Act 2015 .

9BA Colliery holdings

s 9BA: Ins 2006 No 50, Sch 3 [7].

9C Reduction in land value for flats on mixed development land or mixed use land
(1) For the purpose of assessing land tax, the land value of mixed development land or mixed use land on which is situated a flat is to be reduced by the allowable proportion in relation to the flat.
(2) The allowable proportion for a flat is as determined in accordance with whichever of the following paragraphs is applicable in the particular case—
if there is an apportionment factor entered in the Register in respect of that land value—the proportion determined in accordance with the following calculation—
if paragraph (a) is not applicable—the proportion specified in an application for a reduction under this section as the fair and reasonable proportion of the land value of the land to be attributed to the flat, subject to subsections (2A) and (2AA).
(2A)

If there is no apportionment factor entered in the Register in respect of the land value of the land, the Chief Commissioner may request the Valuer-General to determine the apportionment factor in respect of the land concerned.
(2AA)

If a request is made under subsection (2A)—
the Valuer-General must determine the apportionment factor concerned and enter it in the Register, andthe allowable proportion for the flat must be determined in accordance with subsection (2) (a).
(2AB)

Apportionment factors for the purposes of this section are to be ascertained in accordance with Division 5 or Division 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 , as appropriate to the land concerned. If such an apportionment factor is expressed as a percentage, the apportionment factor is, for the purposes of this section, to be converted to a fraction.
Divisions 5 and 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 allow objections to be made against the amount of an apportionment factor.
(2AC)
(3) The reduction under this section applies only if the following requirements are satisfied—
the flat must be used and occupied by the owner of the land (or one of the owners) as his or her principal place of residence and for no other purpose, in which connection the use of the land for the purpose of one, but not more than one, residential occupancy other than that of the owner under lease or licence from the owner may be disregarded if it is an excluded residential occupancy (within the meaning of clause 4 of Schedule 1A),
an owner of the land who occupies the flat must not be an owner merely because of being a trustee,
the land must not be owned, or jointly owned, by a person in the person’s capacity as trustee of a special trust,
the owner of the land must not be a company or company jointly with another person or other persons, except in either case a trustee company acting in its representative capacity.
(4) For the purposes of determining whether a flat has been used and occupied by an owner of land as his or her principal place of residence under subsection (3) (a), clauses 8, 9 and 10 of Schedule 1A apply in respect of the flat, and that part of the land on which the flat is situated, in the same way as they apply in respect of land under the principal place of residence exemption.
The effect of this provision is to deem a flat to be used and occupied by the owner of the land as a principal place of residence in certain circumstances, similar to the principal place of residence exemption. As a consequence, the land value of the mixed development land or mixed use land on which the flat is situated can be reduced by the allowable proportion under this section.
(5) Unless the land concerned is land to which subsection (2) (a) applies, there is to be no reduction under this section unless—
application has been made for the reduction by all the owners of the land, specifying the proportion that in their opinion is a fair and reasonable proportion of the land value of the land to be attributed to the flat, andthe application is made in a form approved by the Chief Commissioner.
(6) There is to be no reduction under this section if the building on the land, or the buildings on the land together, comprise 2 flats and the land is exempted from taxation under this Act.
(6A)

For avoidance of doubt, if a reduction in the land value of land is required under this section and the land is jointly owned, then, for the purposes of section 27 (3) (a), the individual interest of each of the owners of the land (including the owner who occupies the flat) is to be assessed on the basis of the land value of the land as reduced under this section.
(7) This section does not apply to land to which section 9D or 21B applies.
(8) In this section—
mixed development land has the same meaning as in Division 5 of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 .
mixed use land has the same meaning as in Division 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 .

9D Reduction in land value for single dwellings on mixed use land
(1) For the purpose of assessing land tax, the land value of mixed use land on which is situated one single dwelling is to be reduced by the allowable proportion in relation to the dwelling.
(2) The allowable proportion for the dwelling is to be determined in accordance with whichever of the following paragraphs is applicable in the particular case—
if there is an apportionment factor entered in the Register in respect of that land value—the proportion determined by deducting that apportionment factor from 1,
if paragraph (a) is not applicable—the proportion specified in an application for a reduction under this section as the fair and reasonable proportion of the land value of the land to be attributed to the dwelling, subject to subsections (3) and (4).
(3) If there is no apportionment factor entered in the Register in respect of the land value of the land, the Chief Commissioner may request the Valuer-General to determine the apportionment factor in respect of the land concerned.
(4) If a request is made under subsection (3)—
the Valuer-General must determine the apportionment factor concerned and enter it in the Register, andthe allowable proportion for the dwelling must be determined in accordance with subsection (2) (a).
(5) Apportionment factors for the purposes of this section are to be ascertained in accordance with Division 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 . If such an apportionment factor is expressed as a percentage, the apportionment factor is, for the purposes of this section, to be converted to a fraction.

Division 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 allows objections to be made against the amount of an apportionment factor.

(6) The reduction under this section applies only if the following requirements are satisfied—
the single dwelling must be used and occupied by the owner of the land (or one of the owners) as his or her principal place of residence and for no other purpose, in which connection the use of the land for the purpose of one, but not more than one, residential occupancy other than that of the owner under lease or licence from the owner may be disregarded if it is an excluded residential occupancy (within the meaning of clause 4 of Schedule 1A),
an owner of the land who occupies the dwelling must not be an owner merely because of being a trustee,
the owner of the land must not be a company or company jointly with another person or other persons, except in either case a trustee company acting in its representative capacity.
(6A)

For the purposes of determining whether a single dwelling has been used and occupied by an owner of land as his or her principal place of residence under subsection (6) (a), clauses 8, 9 and 10 of Schedule 1A apply in respect of the single dwelling, and that part of the land on which the dwelling is situated, in the same way as they apply in respect of land under the principal place of residence exemption.
The effect of this provision is to deem a single dwelling to be used and occupied by the owner of the land as a principal place of residence in certain circumstances, similar to the principal place of residence exemption. As a consequence, the land value of the mixed use land on which the single dwelling is situated can be reduced by the allowable proportion under this section.
(7) Unless the land concerned is land to which subsection (2) (a) applies, there is to be no reduction under this section unless—
application has been made for the reduction by all the owners of the land, specifying the proportion that in their opinion is a fair and reasonable proportion of the land value of the land to be attributed to the dwelling, andthe application is made in a form approved by the Chief Commissioner.
(8) For avoidance of doubt, if a reduction in the land value of land is required under this section and the land is jointly owned, then, for the purposes of section 27 (3) (a), the individual interest of each of the owners of the land (including the owner who occupies the dwelling) is to be assessed on the basis of the land value of the land as reduced under this section.
(9) For the purposes of applying this section in respect of land on which there is a single dwelling and a residential occupancy other than that of the owner, the use of the land for the purpose of that other residential occupancy may be disregarded if that residential occupancy may be disregarded under the principal place of residence exemption under Schedule 1A.
(10) This section does not apply to land to which section 21B applies.
(11) In this section—
mixed use land has the same meaning as in Division 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 .
single dwelling has the same meaning as it has in Division 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 .

21B Joint owners of block of flats deemed to be owners of lots
(1) This section applies to land if—
the land is owned by joint owners, andthe ownership of an interest in the jointly owned land gives the owner an exclusive right to occupy part of a building on the land (whether jointly with one or more of the co-owners or not), andpart or all of the building comprises at least one flat, andthe Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the whole of the land is reasonably used in connection with the occupation of the building.
(2) For the purposes of assessing land tax in respect of land to which this section applies—

21C Liability of lessees of land owned by Crown or local government bodies
(1) The Crown, a local council, a county council or a joint organisation is not liable for land tax in respect of land it owns (except as specifically provided by Part 3).
(2) A lessee (other than a sub-lessee) of land or part of land owned by the Crown, a local council, a county council or a joint organisation is for land tax purposes deemed to be the owner of a parcel of land ( the notional parcel ) consisting of the land or part leased. The Crown, local council, county council or joint organisation is then not to be considered owner of the notional parcel.
(3) If there are joint lessees, they are deemed to be joint owners of the notional parcel.
(4) For the purposes of determining the lessee’s land tax liability when the notional parcel consists of a part of land, the land value of the notional parcel is the land value of the entire parcel multiplied by the apportionment factor.
(4A)

For the purposes of this section, the apportionment factor is the proportion that the rental value of the notional parcel bears to the rental value of the entire parcel.
(4B)

The Chief Commissioner may request the Valuer-General to determine the land value of the notional parcel.
(4BA)

If a request is made under subsection (4B)—
the Valuer-General must determine the land value of the notional parcel, andthe land value so determined is, subject to subsection (4C), the value of the notional parcel for land tax purposes, and is to be entered in the Register accordingly.
(4BB)

For the purpose of determining the average value of the notional parcel under section 9AA, if the notional parcel was not leased on 31 December immediately before either or both of the preceding land tax years (within the meaning of section 9AA (1)), the average value of the notional parcel is to be determined as provided for by section 9AA (7) (as if the notional parcel did not exist on the date or dates of 31 December on which it was not leased).
(4C)

Part 3 (Notices and objections) and Part 4 (Appeals to Land and Environment Court) of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 apply in respect of the apportionment factor determined under subsection (4BA) in the same way as those Parts apply in respect of a valuation under that Act.

the lessee has failed to pay the land tax amount, andif the land tax amount is not paid by the date specified in the notice, the lessor will be liable for the land tax amount.
(2) The date specified must be at least 21 days after service of the notice.
(3) If the land tax amount is not paid by the date specified in the notice, the non-complying lessor is jointly and severally liable with the lessee to pay the land tax amount.

25A Classification of trust as special trust
(1) If land is subject to a trust, the Chief Commissioner may classify the trust as a special trust for land tax purposes—
on the application of the trustee of the trust, oron the Chief Commissioner’s own motion.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1) (b), the Chief Commissioner may classify a trust as a special trust in relation to a land tax year if any information required to be provided for that land tax year in relation to the trust, the land that is the subject of the trust or the beneficiaries of the trust is not provided as required under this Act.
(3) A classification of a trust as a special trust that is made on the application of the trustee of a trust has effect in respect of any assessment of land tax liability (being an initial assessment of land tax liability) that is made on or after the date on which the trust is classified as a special trust, and does not affect any assessment of land tax liability made before that classification.
(4) However, if an application for classification of a trust as a special trust is duly made by the trustee within the period allowed for the lodging of an objection to a notice of assessment of land tax liability (being a notice that relates to an initial assessment of land tax liability)—
the classification of the trust as a special trust is taken to extend to the land tax year in respect of which that notice of assessment was issued, andliability for that land tax is to be re-assessed accordingly.
(5) The Chief Commissioner may revoke the classification of a trust as a special trust—
on the application of the trustee of the trust, oron the Chief Commissioner’s own motion.
(6) The Chief Commissioner must revoke the classification of a trust as a special trust if the trust was classified as a special trust on the application of the trustee and an application for revocation is duly made by the trustee of the trust.
(7) A revocation of a classification that is made on the application of the trustee of a trust has effect in respect of any assessment of land tax liability (being an initial assessment of land tax liability) that is made on or after the date on which the classification is revoked, and does not affect any assessment of land tax liability that was made before that revocation.
(8) However, if an application for revocation is duly made by the trustee within the period allowed for the lodging of an objection to a notice of assessment of land tax liability (being an initial assessment of land tax liability), and the Chief Commissioner revokes the classification—
the revocation is taken to extend to the land tax year in respect of which that notice of assessment was issued, andliability for land tax is to be re-assessed accordingly.
(9) An application under this section is to be made in a form approved by the Chief Commissioner, and is to include such supporting information as the Chief Commissioner requires.
(10) The Chief Commissioner may, despite anything to the contrary in this section—
reject any application under this section if it is made in contravention of the trust or trust deed that declares the trust concerned, andreject any application for revocation of the classification of a trust as a special trust if any information required to be provided in relation to the trust, the land that is the subject of the trust or the beneficiaries of the trust has not been provided as required under this Act or the Taxation Administration Act 1996 , andassess or re-assess any land tax liability for land the subject of a trust that is not a fixed trust on the basis of the trust being a special trust, including land tax liability in respect of land tax years that commenced or occurred before the trust was classified as a special trust.
(11) In this section—
fixed trust has the meaning given by section 3A.

(2) If land, not being land under the provisions of the Real Property Act 1900 , is the subject of an agreement for sale that has not been completed by conveyance of the land, the vendor of the land is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be the owner of the land, to the exclusion of the liability of the purchaser.
(3) However, the purchaser under the agreement for sale is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be the owner of the land (to the exclusion of the liability of the registered proprietor or vendor) if under the terms of the agreement for sale—
the purchaser is entitled to receive, if the land is let to a tenant, any rents and profits derived from the tenancy, orthe purchaser is entitled to exclusive possession of the land and has taken possession of the land.

(2A)

Where a joint owner of land is—
a trustee under a special trust to which the land is subject, ora company classified under section 29 as a non-concessional company,
no regard shall be had to the existence of the special trust or classification, as the case may be, in relation to the joint assessment and liability of the joint owners of the land as referred to in subsection (2), but regard shall be had to the existence of the special trust or classification, as the case may be, in relation to the separate assessment and liability of the joint owners as referred to in subsection (3).
(3) Each joint owner of land shall in addition be separately assessed and liable in respect of—
his or her individual interest in the land (as if he or she were the owner of a part of the land in proportion to his or her interest), together withany other land owned by him or her in severalty, andhis or her individual interests in any other land.
(3A)
(4) The joint owners in respect of their joint assessment shall be deemed to be the primary taxpayer, and each joint owner in respect of his or her separate assessment to be a secondary taxpayer; and from the land tax payable in respect of his or her interest in the land by each joint owner under subsection (3) there shall be deducted such amount (if any) as is necessary to prevent double taxation.
(5) A joint owner of land who is not otherwise exempt from taxation under this Act is not exempt merely because the person is a joint owner with the Commonwealth, and the person is to be assessed and liable under this section accordingly (with the interest of the Commonwealth being treated as the interest of a joint owner exempt from taxation under this Act).

a parcel of land used or occupied solely as the site of a single dwelling-house and which is, under an environmental planning instrument, zoned or otherwise designated for use for the purposes of industry, commerce or the erection of residential flat buildings,
a parcel of land (which may comprise one or more lots or portions in a current plan within the meaning of the Conveyancing Act 1919 ) used or occupied solely as the site of a single dwelling-house and which is, under an environmental planning instrument, zoned or otherwise designated, so as to permit its subdivision for residential purposes.

(2) However, no account is to be taken of any portion of the land which is in excess of that which is reasonably necessary to be occupied or used in conjunction with the single dwelling-house.
s 62L: Ins 1992 No 84, Sch 1 (19).

62M Unutilised value allowance to be reascertained in certain cases
If the land value of land in respect of which an unutilised value allowance was ascertained is altered (whether as the result of being reascertained or on objection or appeal or for the correction of a clerical error or misdescription), the Valuer-General must reascertain an unutilised value allowance for that land value.
s 62M: Ins 1992 No 84, Sch 1 (19). Am 2000 No 106, Sch 3 [13].

62N Unutilised value allowance can be objected to

(3) Nothing in this clause affects, or is affected by, clause 3.

6 Concession for unoccupied land intended to be owner’s principal place of residence
(1) An owner of unoccupied land is entitled to claim the land as the owner’s principal place of residence if the owner intends to use and occupy the land solely as the owner’s principal place of residence. In such a case, the owner is taken, for the purpose of the principal place of residence exemption, to use and occupy the unoccupied land as the owner’s principal place of residence.
It is an offence under section 55 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 to make a statement to a tax officer, or give information to a tax officer, orally or in writing, knowing that it is false or misleading in a material particular.
(2) This clause does not apply unless—
the land is unoccupied because the owner intends to carry out, or is carrying out, building or other works necessary to facilitate the owner’s intended use and occupation of the land as a principal place of residence, andif those building or other works have physically commenced on the land, no income has been derived from the use and occupation of the land since that commencement, andthe intended use and occupation of the land is not unlawful.

(4) Without limiting subclause (3) (a)—
this clause does not apply in respect of the assessment of a person’s ownership of land in a period referred to in subclause (3) (b) unless the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that, by the end of the first of the 4 tax years concerned—
the building or other works will be, or have been, physically commenced, orsignificant steps will be, or have been, taken to enable those works to physically commence, andif the building or other works are not physically commenced by the end of that tax year (or the Chief Commissioner is not satisfied that, by the end of that tax year, significant steps have been taken to enable those works to physically commence)—
the principal place of residence exemption applying by operation of this clause to the land is taken not to have applied to the land in respect of that tax year (unless subclause (3) (a) applied to the assessment in that tax year), andland tax liability is to be assessed or reassessed accordingly.
(5) If the principal place of residence exemption applies by operation of this clause to land not actually used and occupied by a person as the person’s principal place of residence on a taxing date, that exemption is revoked if the person fails to actually use and occupy the land as the person’s principal place of residence by the end of the period in which this clause applies in respect of the assessment of the person’s ownership of the land and to continue to so use and occupy the land for at least 6 months.
(6) The effect of the revocation is that the principal place of residence exemption is taken not to have applied to the land in respect of any tax year to which, but for the revocation, it would have applied. Land tax liability is to be assessed or reassessed accordingly.

(7A)

The Chief Commissioner may extend the period of 4 tax years in subclause (3)(a) or (b) to a period of up to 6 tax years if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied—
there has been a delay in the completion of the building or other works necessary to facilitate the owner’s intended use and occupation of the land as a principal place of residence, andthe delay is due primarily to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the owner, andthe delay could not reasonably have been avoided by the owner.
(7B)

The Treasurer may, for the purposes of subclause (7A), approve guidelines by publishing the guidelines in the Gazette.
(7C)

The Chief Commissioner must, when making a decision under subclause (7A), consider any guidelines approved under subclause (7B).

a person is the owner of land ( the former residence ) that was the principal place of residence of the person on the relevant taxing date or was the principal place of residence of the person on the preceding taxing date, andthe person is the owner of other land ( the new residence ) that is being or is intended to be used and occupied by the person as the person’s principal place of residence,
both the former residence and the new residence are taken, for the purpose of the principal place of residence exemption, to be used and occupied by the person as the person’s principal place of residence on the relevant taxing date.
(2) This clause applies in respect of land owned by a person only if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that—
the former residence has not been used or occupied except as the person’s principal place of residence, and no income has been derived from the use or occupation of the residence, since the preceding 1 July, except—
income derived from an excluded residential occupancy (within the meaning of clause 4), orincome derived under a lease or licence entered into by the purchaser under a contract for the sale of the former residence for a period pending completion of the sale, andthe person became the owner of the new residence within the period of 6 months before the relevant taxing date, andsince the person became owner of the new residence the new residence has not been used or occupied except—
as the person’s principal place of residence, orby a tenant under a lease entered into by the previous owner.
(3) The principal place of residence exemption cannot be claimed for both a former residence and a new residence under this clause for more than one taxing date.
(3A)

A principal place of residence exemption that applies, by operation of this clause, to land not actually used and occupied by a person at the relevant taxing date is revoked if the person is not actually using and occupying the new residence as the person’s principal place of residence by the next taxing date immediately following the relevant taxing date.
(4) The effect of the revocation is that the principal place of residence exemption is taken not to have applied in respect of the tax year to which, but for the revocation, it would have applied. Land tax liability is to be assessed or reassessed accordingly.
(5) 8 Concession for absences from former residence
(1) A person is taken, for the purpose of the principal place of residence exemption, to continue to use and occupy land formerly used and occupied by the person as a principal place of residence (a former residence ), after the person ceases to so use and occupy the former residence, if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that—
the person used and occupied the former residence as a principal place of residence for a continuous period of at least 6 months, andthe person does not own any other land used and occupied by the person as a principal place of residence.
(2) The maximum period for which a person may be taken, under this clause, to continue to use and occupy a former residence as a principal place of residence is 6 years starting at the end of the last period (of at least 6 months) during which the former residence was used and occupied by the person as a principal place of residence (not including any period for which the person may be taken, under clause 7 or this clause, to have used and occupied the former residence as a principal place of residence).
(3) If the principal place of residence exemption applies to the former residence of a person by operation of this clause, the exemption ceases to have effect if the person is the owner of the former residence at the end of the 6-year period referred to in subclause (2) and fails—
to resume actual use and occupation of the residence as a principal place of residence by the end of that period, andto continue that use and occupation for at least 6 months.
(3A)

The principal place of residence exemption also ceases to have effect if the land ceases to be capable of being used and occupied as a residence and remains incapable of being so used and occupied for a period exceeding 4 years.
(4) Any period during which a person is in full time care is not to be counted toward the maximum period referred to in subclause (2). Accordingly, a person who is in full time care may continue to be taken to use and occupy the person’s former residence as the person’s principal place of residence during any period in which he or she is in full time care.
(5) For the purposes of this clause, a person is in full time care during any period in which the person—

Part 4 Restrictions

To avoid doubt, land that is taken to be owned by more than one person under this Act is taken, for the purposes of this clause, to be jointly owned by them.
See, for example, sections 20 and 25.
(6) This clause does not prevent the principal place of residence exemption applying to land owned by a company if a provision of this Act deems a natural person to be the owner of the land, to the exclusion of the company.
Section 20 provides for circumstances in which a life tenant is taken to be the owner of land, to the exclusion of another owner (including a company). Section 21A provides that a company title unit is not to be regarded as being owned by the company in which the relevant shares are held.
