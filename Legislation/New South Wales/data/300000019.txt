34A Transfer determinations

ASIC issues a certificate of transfer under section 601WBG of that Act for the transfer, andeither the transferring company or the receiving company (or both) is registered in New South Wales.

(3) Without limiting subsection (2):
if the transfer is a total transfer—all of the assets and liabilities of the transferring company become assets and liabilities of the receiving company (without the need for any further conveyance, transfer, assignment or assurance), andif the transfer is a partial transfer—the assets and liabilities listed as referred to in section 601WBG (2) (c) of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth of the transferring company become assets and liabilities of the receiving company (without the need for any further conveyance, transfer, assignment or assurance), andto the extent of the transfer, the duties, obligations, immunities, rights and privileges applying to the transferring company apply to the receiving company, andif the certificate includes provisions of the kind referred to in section 601WBG (3) of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth specifying:
that particular things are to happen or are taken to be the case—those things are, by force of this section, taken to happen, or to be the case, in accordance with those provisions, anda mechanism for determining things that are to happen or are taken to be the case—things determined in accordance with the mechanism are, by force of this section, taken to happen, or to be the case, as determined in accordance with that mechanism.
(4) The operation of this section is not to be regarded as:
a breach of contract or confidence or otherwise as a civil wrong, ora breach of any instrument (including, without limitation, any provision prohibiting, restricting or regulating the assignment or transfer of assets or liabilities), oran event of default under any contract or other instrument, orgiving rise to any remedy by a party to a contract or other instrument, or as causing or permitting the termination of, or exercise of rights under, any contract or other instrument.
