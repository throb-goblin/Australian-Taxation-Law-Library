(4) The Principal Act applies to surcharge land tax in respect of residential land owned by a foreign person subject to the following—
surcharge land tax is payable as if the residential land were the only land owned by the foreign person,
if the residential land is also owned by a person who is not a foreign person, the taxable value of the land is to be reduced to the proportionate value of the interest in the land of the foreign person,
if the foreign person is a joint owner of the residential land, the person is to be individually (and not jointly) assessed and is liable in respect of the value of the person’s proportionate interest in the land as if the person were the owner of a part of the land in proportion to the person’s interest (and accordingly section 27 (2)–(4) of the Principal Act does not apply),

the person is exempt from liability to pay surcharge land tax in respect of the land for a land tax year because the land is the principal place of residence of the foreign person (and accordingly sections 9C and 9D of the Principal Act operate to reduce the land value of the land if it is the principal place of residence of the person) only if the person is eligible for the exemption under section 5B,
the tax thresholds under Division 4A of Part 7 of the Principal Act do not apply to surcharge land tax,
any other modification prescribed by the regulations under the Principal Act applies to surcharge land tax.

if the foreign person is a beneficiary of a trust relating to the land concerned—the trustee (whether or not a foreign person) is, on being served with a notice by the Chief Commissioner requiring payment of the unpaid surcharge land tax, responsible for its payment and the unpaid tax may be recovered from that trustee as if he or she were the defaulting taxpayer,
all payments made under this subsection by that other joint owner or that trustee are taken to be made on behalf of the defaulting taxpayer,
