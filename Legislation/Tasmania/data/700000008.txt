Division 2 - Taxable wages

10. What are taxable wages?

(1) For the purposes of this Act, " taxable wages " are wages that are taxable in this jurisdiction. (2) However, exempt wages are not taxable wages.

11. Wages that are taxable in this jurisdiction

(1) For the purposes of this Act, wages are taxable in this jurisdiction if – (a) wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in relation to services performed by an employee wholly in this jurisdiction; or (b) wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in relation to services performed by an employee in 2 or more Australian jurisdictions, or partly in one or more Australian jurisdictions and partly outside all Australian jurisdictions, and – (i) the employee is based in this jurisdiction; or (ii) the employer is based in this jurisdiction (in a case where the employee is not based in an Australian jurisdiction); or (iii) the wages are paid or payable in this jurisdiction (in a case where both the employee and the employer are not based in an Australian jurisdiction); or (iv) the wages are paid or payable for services performed mainly in this jurisdiction (in a case where both the employee and the employer are not based in an Australian jurisdiction and the wages are not paid or payable in an Australian jurisdiction); or (c) the wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in relation to services performed by an employee wholly outside all Australian jurisdictions and are paid or payable in this jurisdiction. Note: Section 66A provides an exemption for wages paid or payable for services performed wholly in one or more other countries for a continuous period of more than 6 months. (2) The question of whether wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during the month in which the wages are paid or payable, subject to this section. (3) Any wages paid or payable by an employer in respect of an employee in a particular month are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during that month. Note: For example, if wages paid in a month are paid to an employee for services performed over several months, the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid. The services performed in previous months are disregarded. (The services performed in previous months will be relevant to the question of whether wages paid in those previous months are taxable in this jurisdiction.) (4) If no services are performed by an employee in respect of an employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable to or in relation to the employee – (a) the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during the most recent prior month in which the employee performed services in respect of the employer; and (b) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during that most recent prior month. (5) If no services were performed by an employee in respect of an employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable to or in relation to the employee or in any prior month – (a) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable; and (b) the services are taken to have been performed at a place or places where it may be reasonably expected that the services of the employee in respect of the employer will be performed. (6) All amounts of wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer in respect of the same employee are to be aggregated for the purposes of determining whether they are taxable in this jurisdiction (as if they were paid or payable for all services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable, or the most recent prior month, as the case requires). Note: For example, if one amount of wages is paid by an employer in a particular month for services performed in this jurisdiction, and another amount of wages is paid by the same employer in the same month for services performed by the same employee in another Australian jurisdiction, the wages paid are to be aggregated (as if they were paid for all services performed by the employee in that month). Accordingly, subsection (1)(b) would be applied for the purpose of determining whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction. (7) If wages are paid in a different month from the month in which they are payable, the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference to the earlier of the relevant months.
(a) wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in relation to services performed by an employee wholly in this jurisdiction; or (b) wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in relation to services performed by an employee in 2 or more Australian jurisdictions, or partly in one or more Australian jurisdictions and partly outside all Australian jurisdictions, and – (i) the employee is based in this jurisdiction; or (ii) the employer is based in this jurisdiction (in a case where the employee is not based in an Australian jurisdiction); or (iii) the wages are paid or payable in this jurisdiction (in a case where both the employee and the employer are not based in an Australian jurisdiction); or (iv) the wages are paid or payable for services performed mainly in this jurisdiction (in a case where both the employee and the employer are not based in an Australian jurisdiction and the wages are not paid or payable in an Australian jurisdiction); or (c) the wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in relation to services performed by an employee wholly outside all Australian jurisdictions and are paid or payable in this jurisdiction. Note: Section 66A provides an exemption for wages paid or payable for services performed wholly in one or more other countries for a continuous period of more than 6 months.
(i) the employee is based in this jurisdiction; or (ii) the employer is based in this jurisdiction (in a case where the employee is not based in an Australian jurisdiction); or (iii) the wages are paid or payable in this jurisdiction (in a case where both the employee and the employer are not based in an Australian jurisdiction); or (iv) the wages are paid or payable for services performed mainly in this jurisdiction (in a case where both the employee and the employer are not based in an Australian jurisdiction and the wages are not paid or payable in an Australian jurisdiction); or
Note: Section 66A provides an exemption for wages paid or payable for services performed wholly in one or more other countries for a continuous period of more than 6 months.
Note: For example, if wages paid in a month are paid to an employee for services performed over several months, the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid. The services performed in previous months are disregarded. (The services performed in previous months will be relevant to the question of whether wages paid in those previous months are taxable in this jurisdiction.)
(a) the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during the most recent prior month in which the employee performed services in respect of the employer; and (b) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during that most recent prior month.
(a) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable; and (b) the services are taken to have been performed at a place or places where it may be reasonably expected that the services of the employee in respect of the employer will be performed.
Note: For example, if one amount of wages is paid by an employer in a particular month for services performed in this jurisdiction, and another amount of wages is paid by the same employer in the same month for services performed by the same employee in another Australian jurisdiction, the wages paid are to be aggregated (as if they were paid for all services performed by the employee in that month). Accordingly, subsection (1)(b) would be applied for the purpose of determining whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction.

11 A. Jurisdiction in which employee is based

(1) For the purposes of this Act, the jurisdiction in which an employee is based is the jurisdiction in which the employee's principal place of residence is located. (2) The jurisdiction in which an employee is based is to be determined by reference to the state of affairs existing during the month in which the relevant wages are paid or payable. (3) If more than one jurisdiction would qualify as the jurisdiction in which an employee is based during a month, the jurisdiction in which the employee is based is to be determined by reference to the state of affairs existing on the last day of that month. (4) An employee who does not have a principal place of residence is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be an employee who is not based in an Australian jurisdiction. (5) In the case of wages paid or payable to a corporate employee, the jurisdiction in which the employee is based is to be determined in accordance with section 11B instead of this section (as if a reference in section 11B to an employer were a reference to an employee). (6) In this section, a " corporate employee " is a company that is taken to be an employee under section 34 or 39 or a company to whom a payment is made that is taken to be wages payable to an employee under section 42 or 47 .

11 B. Jurisdiction in which employer is based

(1) For the purposes of this Act, the jurisdiction in which an employer is based is – (a) the jurisdiction in which the employer's registered business address is located (if the employer has an ABN); or (b) the jurisdiction in which the employer's principal place of business is located (in any other case). (2) If wages are paid or payable in connection with a business carried on by an employer under a trust, the employer's registered business address is the registered business address of the trust or, if the trust does not have an ABN, the registered business address of the trustee of the trust. (3) If an employer has registered business addresses located in different jurisdictions at the same point in time, the jurisdiction in which the employer is based at that point in time is the jurisdiction in which the employer's principal place of business is located. (4) The jurisdiction in which an employer is based is to be determined by reference to the state of affairs existing during the month in which the relevant wages are paid or payable. (5) If more than one jurisdiction would qualify as the jurisdiction in which an employer is based during a month, the jurisdiction in which the employer is based is to be determined by reference to the state of affairs existing on the last day of that month. (6) An employer who has neither a registered business address nor a principal place of business is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be an employer who is not based in an Australian jurisdiction.
(a) the jurisdiction in which the employer's registered business address is located (if the employer has an ABN); or (b) the jurisdiction in which the employer's principal place of business is located (in any other case).

11 C. Place and date of payment of wages

(1) For the purposes of this Act, wages are taken to have been paid at a place if, for the purpose of the payment of those wages – (a) an instrument is sent or given or an amount is transferred by an employer to a person or a person's agent at that place; or (b) an instruction is given by an employer for the crediting of an amount to the account of a person or a person's agent at that place. (2) The wages are taken to have been paid on the date that the instrument was sent or given, the amount was transferred or the account credited in accordance with the instruction (as the case requires). (3) Wages are taken to be payable at the place at which they are paid, subject to this section. (4) Wages that are not paid by the end of the month in which they are payable are taken to be payable at – (a) the place where wages were last paid by the employer to the employee; or (b) if wages have not previously been paid by the employer to the employee – the place where the employee last performed services in respect of the employer before the wages became payable. (5) If wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer in respect of the same employee are paid or payable in more than one Australian jurisdiction, the wages paid or payable in that month are taken to be paid or payable in the Australian jurisdiction in which the highest proportion of the wages are paid or payable. Note: Section 11 requires all wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer in respect of the same employee to be aggregated for the purpose of determining whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction. The above provision ensures only one Australian jurisdiction can be considered to be the jurisdiction in which the wages are paid or payable.
(a) an instrument is sent or given or an amount is transferred by an employer to a person or a person's agent at that place; or (b) an instruction is given by an employer for the crediting of an amount to the account of a person or a person's agent at that place.

Division 3 - Business groups – tracing of interests in corporations

75. Application

This Division applies for the purposes of section 73 (Groups arising from tracing of interests in corporations).

76. Direct interest

(1) An entity has a " direct interest " in a corporation if – (a) in the case of an entity that is a person, the person can, directly or indirectly, exercise, control the exercise of, or substantially influence the exercise of, the voting power attached to any voting shares issued by the corporation; or (b) in the case of an entity that is 2 or more persons who are associated persons, each of the associated persons can, directly or indirectly, exercise, control the exercise of, or substantially influence the exercise of, the voting power attached to any voting shares issued by the corporation. (2) The value of the direct interest of the entity in the corporation is the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of the voting power of all voting shares issued by the corporation that – (a) in the case of an entity that is a person, the person can directly or indirectly exercise, control the exercise of, or substantially influence the exercise of, as referred to in subsection (1) ; or (b) in the case of an entity that is 2 or more persons who are associated persons, the associated persons can, if acting together, directly or indirectly exercise, control the exercise of, or substantially influence the exercise of, as referred to in subsection (1) .
(a) in the case of an entity that is a person, the person can, directly or indirectly, exercise, control the exercise of, or substantially influence the exercise of, the voting power attached to any voting shares issued by the corporation; or (b) in the case of an entity that is 2 or more persons who are associated persons, each of the associated persons can, directly or indirectly, exercise, control the exercise of, or substantially influence the exercise of, the voting power attached to any voting shares issued by the corporation.
(a) in the case of an entity that is a person, the person can directly or indirectly exercise, control the exercise of, or substantially influence the exercise of, as referred to in subsection (1) ; or (b) in the case of an entity that is 2 or more persons who are associated persons, the associated persons can, if acting together, directly or indirectly exercise, control the exercise of, or substantially influence the exercise of, as referred to in subsection (1) .

77. Indirect interest

(1) An entity has an " indirect interest " in a corporation if the corporation is linked to another corporation (the " directly controlled corporation " ) in which the entity has a direct interest. (2) A corporation is linked to a directly controlled corporation if the corporation is part of a chain of corporations – (a) that starts with the directly controlled corporation; and (b) in which a link in the chain is formed if a corporation has a direct interest in the next corporation in the chain. (3) The following are examples of how subsections (1) and (2) work (the examples are cumulative): (a) corporation A (a directly controlled corporation) has a direct interest in corporation B. Corporations A and B form part of a chain of corporations, and corporation B is linked to corporation A. Accordingly, an entity that has a direct interest in corporation A also has an indirect interest in corporation B; (b) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation C. In this case, corporations A, B and C form part of a chain of corporations. Both corporations B and C are linked to corporation A. The entity that has a direct interest in corporation A has an indirect interest in both corporations B and C; (c) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation D. There are now 2 chains of corporations, one consisting of A, B and C, and one consisting of A, B and D. Corporations B, C and D are all linked to corporation A and an entity that has a direct interest in corporation A would have an indirect interest in corporations B, C and D. An entity that has a direct interest in corporation B would have an indirect interest in corporations C and D. However, an entity that has a direct interest in corporation C only would not have an indirect interest in corporation D, as corporation D is not linked to corporation C. (4) The value of the indirect interest of an entity in a corporation (an " indirectly controlled corporation " ) that is linked to a directly controlled corporation is calculated by multiplying together the following: (a) the value of the direct interest of the entity in the directly controlled corporation; (b) the value of each direct interest that forms a link in the chain of corporations by which the indirectly controlled corporation is linked to the directly controlled corporation. (5) The following are examples of how subsection (4) works (the examples are cumulative): (a) an entity has a direct interest (with a value of 80%) in corporation A. Corporation A has a direct interest (with a value of 70%) in corporation B. The value of the indirect interest of the entity in corporation B is 80% × 70% (that is, 56%). Accordingly, in this example the entity has a controlling interest (within the meaning of section 73 (Groups arising from tracing of interests in corporations)) in corporation B; (b) corporation B also has a direct interest (with a value of 40%) in corporation C. The value of the indirect interest of the entity in corporation C is 80% × 70% × 40% (that is, 22.4%). Accordingly, in this example the entity does not have a controlling interest in corporation C. (6) It is possible for an entity to have more than one indirect interest in a corporation. This may occur if the corporation is linked to more than one corporation in which the entity has a direct interest, or if the corporation is linked to only one corporation in which the entity has a direct interest but is linked through more than one chain of corporations. In that case, the entity has an aggregate interest in the corporation (see section 78 (Aggregation of interests)).
(a) that starts with the directly controlled corporation; and (b) in which a link in the chain is formed if a corporation has a direct interest in the next corporation in the chain.
(a) corporation A (a directly controlled corporation) has a direct interest in corporation B. Corporations A and B form part of a chain of corporations, and corporation B is linked to corporation A. Accordingly, an entity that has a direct interest in corporation A also has an indirect interest in corporation B; (b) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation C. In this case, corporations A, B and C form part of a chain of corporations. Both corporations B and C are linked to corporation A. The entity that has a direct interest in corporation A has an indirect interest in both corporations B and C; (c) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation D. There are now 2 chains of corporations, one consisting of A, B and C, and one consisting of A, B and D. Corporations B, C and D are all linked to corporation A and an entity that has a direct interest in corporation A would have an indirect interest in corporations B, C and D. An entity that has a direct interest in corporation B would have an indirect interest in corporations C and D. However, an entity that has a direct interest in corporation C only would not have an indirect interest in corporation D, as corporation D is not linked to corporation C.
(a) the value of the direct interest of the entity in the directly controlled corporation; (b) the value of each direct interest that forms a link in the chain of corporations by which the indirectly controlled corporation is linked to the directly controlled corporation.
(a) an entity has a direct interest (with a value of 80%) in corporation A. Corporation A has a direct interest (with a value of 70%) in corporation B. The value of the indirect interest of the entity in corporation B is 80% × 70% (that is, 56%). Accordingly, in this example the entity has a controlling interest (within the meaning of section 73 (Groups arising from tracing of interests in corporations)) in corporation B; (b) corporation B also has a direct interest (with a value of 40%) in corporation C. The value of the indirect interest of the entity in corporation C is 80% × 70% × 40% (that is, 22.4%). Accordingly, in this example the entity does not have a controlling interest in corporation C.

78. Aggregation of interests

(1) An entity has an " aggregate interest " in a corporation if – (a) the entity has a direct interest and one or more indirect interests in the corporation; or (b) the entity has more than one indirect interest in the corporation. (2) The value of the aggregate interest of an entity in a corporation is the sum of the following: (a) the value of the direct interest (if any) of the entity in the corporation; (b) the value of each indirect interest of the entity in the corporation. (3) For example: (a) an entity has a direct interest (with a value of 40%) in corporation B; (b) the entity also has a direct interest (with a value of 25%) in corporation A, which in turn has a direct interest (with a value of 60%) in corporation B. Accordingly, the entity also has an indirect interest in corporation B with a value of 15% (that is, 25% x 60%); (c) the value of the entity's aggregate interest in corporation B is the sum of the direct interest (40%) and the indirect interest (15%), which is 55%; (d) accordingly, in this example, the entity has a controlling interest in corporation B (within the meaning of section 73 (Groups arising from tracing of interests in corporations)).
(a) the entity has a direct interest and one or more indirect interests in the corporation; or (b) the entity has more than one indirect interest in the corporation.
(a) the value of the direct interest (if any) of the entity in the corporation; (b) the value of each indirect interest of the entity in the corporation.
(a) an entity has a direct interest (with a value of 40%) in corporation B; (b) the entity also has a direct interest (with a value of 25%) in corporation A, which in turn has a direct interest (with a value of 60%) in corporation B. Accordingly, the entity also has an indirect interest in corporation B with a value of 15% (that is, 25% x 60%); (c) the value of the entity's aggregate interest in corporation B is the sum of the direct interest (40%) and the indirect interest (15%), which is 55%; (d) accordingly, in this example, the entity has a controlling interest in corporation B (within the meaning of section 73 (Groups arising from tracing of interests in corporations)).

PART 6 - Adjustments of Tax

82. Determination of correct amount of payroll tax

(1) For the purposes of this Part, the " correct amount of payroll tax " payable by an employer in respect of a financial year is the amount determined in accordance with Schedule 1 in respect of that financial year. (2) This Part applies in respect of payroll tax paid or payable whether as a group employer or as an individual employer. (3) If an employer is liable for payroll tax both as an individual employer and as a group employer (for different periods in the same financial year) separate adjustments are to be made under this Part in respect of any period as a group employer and any period as an individual employer (and for that purpose separate determinations of the correct amount of payroll tax payable by the employer are to be made). (4) In this Part – group employer means an employer who is a member of a group; individual employer means an employer who is not a member of a group.
group employer means an employer who is a member of a group;
individual employer means an employer who is not a member of a group.

83. Annual adjustment of payroll tax

(1) If the amount of payroll tax paid or payable by an employer when the employer made the returns relating to a financial year is greater than the correct amount of payroll tax payable by the employer in respect of the financial year, the Commissioner (on application by the employer) is to refund to that employer an amount equal to the difference. (2) If the amount of payroll tax paid or payable by an employer when the employer made the returns relating to a financial year is less than the correct amount of payroll tax payable by the employer in respect of the financial year, the employer must pay to the Commissioner as payroll tax an amount equal to the difference. (3) Any amount payable by an employer under this section in respect of a financial year must be paid within the period during which the employer is required to lodge a return under this Act in respect of the return period that is or includes the month of June in that financial year. (4) The amount of any refund payable to an employer in respect of a financial year under this section is to be reduced by the amount of any other refund of payroll tax made in respect of that financial year to that employer (whether under this section or otherwise) before the time of the refund under this section.

84. Adjustment of payroll tax when employer changes circumstances

(1) If an employer changes their circumstances during a financial year, the employer must, if the amount of payroll tax paid or payable by the employer when the employer made returns relating to the relevant period prior to the change of circumstances is less than the correct amount of payroll tax payable by the employer in respect of the financial year, pay to the Commissioner as payroll tax an amount equal to the difference. (2) A " change of circumstances " occurs when the employer – (a) ceases to pay or be liable to pay taxable wages and interstate wages; or (b) becomes a group employer (following a period as an individual employer); or (c) ceases to be a group employer (and becomes an individual employer). (3) The " relevant period " prior to a change of circumstances is the period prior to the change (during the financial year concerned and since any prior change of circumstances) for which the employer paid or was liable to pay taxable wages or interstate wages. (4) In calculating for the purposes of this section the correct amount of payroll tax payable by the employer, it is to be assumed that the wages paid or payable by the employer during the relevant period are the only wages paid or payable by the employer during the financial year concerned. (5) Any amount payable by an employer under this section in respect of a relevant period must be paid within the period during which the employer is required to lodge a return under this Act relating to that relevant period or the last return under this Act relating to the relevant period. (6) Any payroll tax paid or payable by an employer under this section is to be included as payroll tax paid or payable by the employer for the purposes of the annual adjustment of payroll tax under this Part. Note: If an employer ceases to be a group employer during a financial year an adjustment will be made under this section. If later in that financial year the employer ceases to pay wages there will be a further adjustment under this section. The first adjustment will adjust payroll tax paid for the period as a group employer against the correct amount of tax that should have been paid (based on the assumption that the period as a group employer is the only period for which the employer paid wages throughout the year). The second adjustment will adjust payroll tax paid for the period as an individual employer against the correct amount of tax that should have been paid (based on the assumption that the period as an individual employer is the only period for which the employer paid wages throughout the year). Any amount of payroll tax paid under this section is taken into account for the purposes of the annual adjustment of payroll tax.
(a) ceases to pay or be liable to pay taxable wages and interstate wages; or (b) becomes a group employer (following a period as an individual employer); or (c) ceases to be a group employer (and becomes an individual employer).
Note: If an employer ceases to be a group employer during a financial year an adjustment will be made under this section. If later in that financial year the employer ceases to pay wages there will be a further adjustment under this section. The first adjustment will adjust payroll tax paid for the period as a group employer against the correct amount of tax that should have been paid (based on the assumption that the period as a group employer is the only period for which the employer paid wages throughout the year). The second adjustment will adjust payroll tax paid for the period as an individual employer against the correct amount of tax that should have been paid (based on the assumption that the period as an individual employer is the only period for which the employer paid wages throughout the year). Any amount of payroll tax paid under this section is taken into account for the purposes of the annual adjustment of payroll tax.

85. Special provision where wages fluctuate

If a person who did not pay and was not liable to pay taxable wages or interstate wages for any part of a financial year satisfies the Commissioner that, by reason of the nature of the person's trade or business, the taxable wages and interstate wages, if any, paid or payable by the person fluctuate with different periods of the financial year, the Commissioner may determine that the person is to be treated for the purposes of this Part – (a) if the person has conducted that trade or business in Australia during the whole of the financial year, as an employer who pays or is liable to pay taxable wages throughout the financial year; or (b) if the person has conducted that trade or business in Australia during part only of the financial year, as an employer who pays or is liable to pay taxable wages throughout that last-mentioned part of the financial year. Note: The effect of such a determination is that when the correct amount of payroll tax is calculated (for the purposes of a tax adjustment provided for by this Part) the employer may receive the benefit of the thresholds in Schedule 1 for the period for which the employer is to be treated as paying wages, and not just for the period for which the employer actually pays wages. Without such a determination, an employer may only receive the benefit of a proportion of the thresholds that is equivalent to the proportion of the whole financial year for which the employer actually pays wages.
(a) if the person has conducted that trade or business in Australia during the whole of the financial year, as an employer who pays or is liable to pay taxable wages throughout the financial year; or (b) if the person has conducted that trade or business in Australia during part only of the financial year, as an employer who pays or is liable to pay taxable wages throughout that last-mentioned part of the financial year.
