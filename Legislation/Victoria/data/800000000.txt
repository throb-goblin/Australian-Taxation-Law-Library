10 Aggregation of interests acquired under qualifying dutiable transactions
S. 10(1) amended by No. 48/2025 s. 6.
(1) For the purposes of section 8(1)(c)(ii), an interest in land obtained by a person under a qualifying dutiable transaction must be aggregated with another interest in the land obtained under another qualifying dutiable transaction if—
(a) those dutiable transactions are aggregated under section 24 of the Duties Act 2000; or
(b) the dutiable transactions occur within a 3 year period and either—
(i) the transferee under each dutiable transaction is the same person; or
(ii) the transferees under the dutiable transactions are associated persons.
Example
Person A is the transferee under a transfer of land occurring on 1 July 2024 relating to a 35% interest in the land (qualifying dutiable transaction A).  Person B is the transferee under a transfer of land occurring on 1 July 2026 relating to a 15% interest in the same land (qualifying dutiable transaction B).  Persons A and B are associated persons.  The interests they acquired in the land are aggregated and together amount to a qualifying interest.  This means qualifying dutiable transaction B is the entry transaction for the land.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a person is not an associated person of another person if the Commissioner is satisfied that the interests of the persons—
(a) were acquired, and will be used, independently; and
(b) were not acquired, and will not be used, for a common purpose.
(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the persons are associated persons because they are related bodies corporate.

11 What is a qualifying landholder transaction?
(1) A transaction is a qualifying landholder transaction if—
(a) the transaction is a relevant acquisition; and
(b) at the time of the relevant acquisition, the landholder holds an interest in land described in section 10(1)(a) of the Duties Act 2000; and
S. 11(1)(c) substituted by No. 48/2025 s. 7.
(c) duty is chargeable on the relevant acquisition under the Duties Act 2000; and
(d) the relevant acquisition is not an eligible transaction within the meaning of section 250A of the Duties Act 2000.
(2) However, a relevant acquisition is not a qualifying landholder transaction if the relevant acquisition is made pursuant to an agreement or arrangement that was entered into before the commencement of this Act.
(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), the interest the landholder holds in land is to be determined in accordance with Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Duties Act 2000.
(4) An interest in land is to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) if the Commissioner determines under section 89I of the Duties Act 2000 that the land was not, at the time of the relevant acquisition, a land holding of the landholder.

12 Determination of interest acquired under qualifying landholder transaction
(1) The interest in land that a person is taken to have acquired under a qualifying landholder transaction is the interest calculated in accordance with the following formula—
where—
Ais the interest acquired in the landholder under the qualifying landholder transaction on which duty is chargeable under Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Duties Act 2000;
Bis the interest the landholder holds in the land at the time the relevant acquisition is made.
(2) For the purposes of the variable B, the interest the landholder holds in land is to be determined in accordance with Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Duties Act 2000.
(3) If, at the time of a relevant acquisition described in section 11(1), a landholder holds more than one interest in land described in section 11(1)(b), the relevant acquisition is taken to be a separate qualifying landholder transaction in respect of each interest in land held by the landholder.

13 Aggregation of interests acquired under qualifying landholder transactions
S. 13(1) amended by No. 48/2025 s. 8.
(1) For the purposes of section 8(1)(c)(ii), an interest in land obtained by a person under a qualifying landholder transaction must be aggregated with another interest in the land obtained under another qualifying landholder transaction if—
(a) the qualifying landholder transactions occur within a 3 year period; and
(b) under each qualifying landholder transaction, a relevant acquisition is made in the same landholder; and
(c) the relevant acquisitions in the landholder are made by the same person or associated persons.
Example
Person A obtains a 20% interest in land under a qualifying landholder transaction occurring on 1 December 2024 (qualifying landholder transaction A).  Person B obtains a 40% interest in the land under a qualifying landholder transaction occurring on 1 July 2026 (qualifying landholder transaction B).  Person A and Person B are associated persons.  The interests Persons A and B acquired in the land are aggregated and together amount to a qualifying interest.  This means qualifying landholder transaction B is the entry transaction for the land.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a person is not an associated person of another person if the Commissioner is satisfied that the interests of the persons—
(a) were acquired, and will be used, independently; and
(b) were not acquired, and will not be used, for a common purpose.
(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the persons are associated persons because they are related bodies corporate.

Example to s. 15 amended by No. 48/2025 s. 9.
Example
A plan of subdivision is registered on 1 January 2025 in relation to a parcel of land that is tax reform scheme land (Land A) and another parcel of land that is not tax reform scheme land (Land B).

INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA)
Style changes
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in Schedule 1 to that Act.
References to ILA s. 39B
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or clause.
Interpretation
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the following effects:
•Headings
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A).
•Examples, diagrams or notes
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).
•Punctuation
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Act.  See section 36(3B).
•Provision numbers
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  See section 36(3C).
•Location of "legislative items"
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B.
•Other material
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.  See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
