# Optional extras
#
# Inscriptis provides higher-quality HTML-to-text with better preservation of
# spacing/indentation/tables, but it depends on `lxml`.
# On Windows with very new Python versions (e.g. 3.14), `lxml` wheels may not yet
# be available, and installing it can require Microsoft C++ Build Tools.
