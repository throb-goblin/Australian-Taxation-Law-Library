TRUSTEE COMPANIES ACT 1964
Section 34A
Transfer determinations
 
 
34A Transfer determinations
     (1) This section applies if:
          (a) the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (
          "ASIC") makes a determination under section 601WBA of the
          Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth that there is to
          be a transfer of estate assets and liabilities from a
          specified trustee company (the
          "transferring company") to another licensed trustee company
          (the
          "receiving company"), and
          (b) ASIC issues a certificate of transfer under section
          601WBG of that Act for the transfer, and
          (c) either the transferring company or the receiving
          company (or both) is registered in New South Wales.
          Note--: Section 601WBA of the Corporations Act 2001 of the
          Commonwealth enables ASIC to make a transfer determination
          if:
               (a) ASIC has cancelled the licence of the
               transferring company (in which case the
               determination is called a
               "compulsory transfer determination"), or
               (b) the transferring company has applied for such
               a determination (in which case the determination
               is called a
               "voluntary transfer determination").
     (2) When the certificate of transfer comes into force, the receiving
     company is taken to be the successor in law in relation to estate
     assets and liabilities of the transferring company, to the extent of
     the transfer.
          Note--: Section 601WBG of the Corporations Act 2001 of the
          Commonwealth requires the certificate of transfer to state
          when it is to come into force.
     (3) Without limiting subsection (2):
          (a) if the transfer is a total transfer--all of the assets
          and liabilities of the transferring company become assets
          and liabilities of the receiving company (without the need
          for any further conveyance, transfer, assignment or
          assurance), and
          (b) if the transfer is a partial transfer--the assets and
          liabilities listed as referred to in section 601WBG (2) (c)
          of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth of the
          transferring company become assets and liabilities of the
          receiving company (without the need for any further
          conveyance, transfer, assignment or assurance), and
          (c) to the extent of the transfer, the duties, obligations,
          immunities, rights and privileges applying to the
          transferring company apply to the receiving company, and
          (d) if the certificate includes provisions of the kind
          referred to in section 601WBG (3) of the Corporations Act
          2001 of the Commonwealth specifying:
               (i) that particular things are to happen or are
               taken to be the case--those things are, by force
               of this section, taken to happen, or to be the
               case, in accordance with those provisions, and
               (ii) a mechanism for determining things that are
               to happen or are taken to be the case--things
               determined in accordance with the mechanism are,
               by force of this section, taken to happen, or to
               be the case, as determined in accordance with
               that mechanism.
     (4) The operation of this section is not to be regarded as:
          (a) a breach of contract or confidence or otherwise as a
          civil wrong, or
          (b) a breach of any instrument (including, without
          limitation, any provision prohibiting, restricting or
          regulating the assignment or transfer of assets or
          liabilities), or
          (c) an event of default under any contract or other
          instrument, or
          (d) giving rise to any remedy by a party to a contract or
          other instrument, or as causing or permitting the
          termination of, or exercise of rights under, any contract
          or other instrument.
