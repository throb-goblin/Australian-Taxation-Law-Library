Method statementStep 1. Take the person&#39;s *accumulated HELP debt for the immediately preceding financial year. (This amount is taken to be zero if the person has no accumulated HELP debt for that financial year.)Step 2. Take the HELP debts (if any) that the person incurred during the last 6 months of the immediately preceding financial year. Group them according to whether the debts are in relation to: (a) units undertaken with a higher education provider that formed part of one particular *course of study with that provider; or (b) units undertaken with a higher education provider that formed part of one particular course of study with another higher education provider; or (c) units that formed part of one particular *bridging course for overseas-trained professionals; or (d) units access to which was provided by *Open Universities Australia; or (e) *OS-HELP assistance, the entitlement to which relates to the person&#39;s enrolment in a *course of study with one particular higher education provider (see paragraph 118-1(1)(c)); or (ea) *SA-HELP assistance for *student services and amenities fees imposed on the person by one particular higher education provider; or (eb) *STARTUP-HELP assistance for an *accelerator program course provided by one particular higher education provider; or (f) units undertaken with a *VET provider that formed part of one particular *VET course of study with that provider; or (g) units undertaken with a VET provider that formed part of one particular VET course of study with another VET provider; or (h) a *VET student loan in relation to one particular course of study. Note: There will be more than one group of debts under paragraph (a) if the person incurred debts in relation to more than one course of study with a provider. Similarly, there could be more than one group of debts under paragraph (b), (c), (e), (ea), (eb), (f), (g) or (h).Step 2A. Work out the total for each group of debts. If the total for a particular group is an amount consisting of a number of whole dollars and a number of cents, the total for that group is taken to be the number of whole dollars. If the total for a group is an amount of less than one dollar, the total for the group is taken to be zero.Step 2B. If there is more than one group of debts for the person, add together the totals for all of the groups. Step 2C. Add the amount worked out under step 2A or 2B (as the case requires) to the amount referred to in step 1.Step 3. Subtract the sum of the amounts by which the person&#39;s debts referred to above are reduced because of any *voluntary repayments that have been made during the period: (a) starting on 1 June in the immediately preceding financial year; and (b) ending immediately before the next 1 June. Step 4. Subtract the sum of all of the person&#39;s *compulsory repayment amounts that: (a) were assessed during that period (excluding any assessed as a result of a *return given before that period); or (b) were assessed after the end of that period as a result of a return given before the end of that period. Step 5. Subtract the sum of the amounts by which any *compulsory repayment amount of the person is increased (whether as a result of an increase in the person&#39;s *taxable income of an *income year or otherwise) by an amendment of an assessment made during that period.Step 6. Add the sum of the amounts by which any *compulsory repayment amount of the person is reduced (whether as a result of a reduction in the person&#39;s *taxable income of an *income year or otherwise) by an amendment of an assessment made during that period.

Example: Lorraine is studying part-time for a Degree of Bachelor of Communications. On 1 June 2013, Lorraine had an accumulated HELP debt of $15,000. She incurred a HELP debt of $1,500 on 31 March 2013. She made a voluntary repayment of $525 on 1 May 2014.

On 1  June 2009, her former accumulated HELP debt was worked out using Subdivision 140-B to be $20,000. She incurred a HELP debt of $1,500 on 31  August 2008. No repayments have been made in the 12 months from 1 June 2008.\n Paula&#39;s accumulated HELP debt on 1 June 2009 is worked out by taking her former accumulated HELP debt of $20,000 and adding the $1,500 HELP debt incurred on 31  August 2008. That is:\n (1A) For the purposes of the definition of HELP debts incurred in subsection (1), use the following method statement:\nStep 1. Take the HELP debts (if any) that the person incurred during the first 6 months of the financial year. Group them according to whether the debts are in relation to:\n (a) units undertaken with a higher education provider that formed part of one particular *course of study with that provider; or (b) units undertaken with a higher education provider that formed part of one particular course of study with another higher education provider; or (c) units that formed part of one particular *bridging course for overseas-trained professionals; or (d) units access to which was provided by *Open Universities Australia; or (e) *OS-HELP assistance, the entitlement to which relates to the person&#39;s enrolment in a *course of study with one particular higher education provider (see paragraph  118-1(1)(c)); or (ea) *SA-HELP assistance for *student services and amenities fees imposed on the person by one particular higher education provider; or (eb) *STARTUP-HELP assistance for an *accelerator program course provided by one particular higher education provider; or (f) units undertaken with a *VET provider that formed part of one particular *VET course of study with that provider; or (g) units undertaken with a VET provider that formed part of one particular VET course of study with another VET provider; or (h) a *VET student loan in relation to one particular course of study.\n Note: There will be more than one group of debts under paragraph (a) if the person incurred debts in relation to more than one course of study with a provider. Similarly, there could be more than one group of debts under paragraph  (b), (c), (e), (ea), (eb), (f), (g) or (h).Step 2. Work out the total for each group of debts. If the total for a particular group is an amount consisting of a number of whole dollars and a number of cents, the total for that group is taken to be the number of whole dollars. If the total for a group is an amount of less than one dollar, the total for the group is taken to be zero.Step 3. If there is more than one group of debts for the person, add together the totals for all of the groups.\n (2) The person incurs the *accumulated HELP debt on 1 June in the financial year.\n (3) The first financial year for which a person can have an *accumulated HELP debt is the financial year starting on 1 July 2005."

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), the amount to be credited is the amount equal to: where: \"VET provider&#39;s adjusted 2015 total loan amount\" means the sum of the amounts of *VET FEE -HELP assistance paid for students undertaking, with the *VET provider, *VET units of study that had *census dates during the period starting on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 August 2015. (4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), the amount to be credited is the amount equal to the sum of: (a) the *VET provider&#39;s fee revenue for the period: (i) starting on 1 January 2015; and (ii) ending on the day before the VET provider was approved as a VET provider; for *domestic students undertaking *qualifying VET courses in that period; and (b) the sum of the amounts of *VET FEE-HELP assistance paid for students undertaking, with the VET provider, *VET units of study that had *census dates during 2015. (5) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(c), the amount to be credited is the amount equal to the *VET provider&#39;s fee revenue for the 2015 calendar year for *domestic students undertaking in that year the *qualifying VET courses that enabled paragraph 6(1)(ca) or (1A)(da) to be satisfied for the purposes of the VET provider&#39;s approval as a VET provider. (6) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine: (a) whether credits arise in the *VET FEE-HELP accounts of specified *VET providers when another body ceases to be a VET provider; and (b) the amounts of such credits. Debits to the VET FEE-HELP account (7) A debit arises in the *VET provider&#39;s *VET FEE-HELP account if a student is entitled to *VET FEE-HELP assistance for a *VET unit of study: (a) that is to be undertaken with the VET provider; and (b) that has a *census date on or after 1 January 2016.
