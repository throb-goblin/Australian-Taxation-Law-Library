However, the services performed or rendered in previous months are relevant to the question of whether wages paid in the previous months are liable to payroll tax and the mental health levy under this Act. (4) If no services are performed or rendered by an employee for an employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable in relation to the employeeâ (a) the question of whether the wages are liable to payroll tax and the mental health levy under this Act must be decided by reference only to the services performed or rendered by the employee for the employer during the most recent earlier month in which the employee performed or rendered services for the employer; and (b) the wages are taken to be paid or payable in relation to the services performed or rendered by the employee for the employer in that most recent earlier month. (5) If no services were performed or rendered by an employee for an employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable in relation to the employee or in any earlier monthâ (a) the wages are taken to be paid or payable in relation to services performed or rendered by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable; and (b) the services are taken to have been performed or rendered at a place where it may reasonably be expected that the services of the employee for the employer will first be performed. (6) All amounts of wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer for the same employee must be aggregated for deciding whether the wages are liable to payroll tax and the mental health levy under this Act. Exampleâ If 1 amount of wages is paid by an employer in a particular month in relation to services performed or rendered in Queensland, and another amount of wages is paid by the same employer in the same month in relation to services performed or rendered by the same employee in another State, the wages paid must be aggregated as if they were paid or payable in relation to all services performed or rendered by the employee in that month.

Example for paragraph (b)â The amount of an employerâs annual levy liability would be the annual levy amount if the employer was exempt, under a certificate issued by the commissioner under section 62, from lodging periodic returns during the financial year. (2) Subsection (1) applies subject to subsections (3) to (7). (3) Subsection (4) applies ifâ (a) the employer is not a group member on 30 June in the financial year; and (b) under section 64 (2) or (5), a person lodged, or was required to lodge, a final return for a final period during the financial year stating the personâs final levy liability or final levy refund amount for the final period; and (c) the stated final levy liability or final levy refund amount was calculated wholly or partly with reference to wages paid or payable by the employer during the final period ( \"final levy return wages\"). (4) For working out the employerâs annual levy liability for the financial yearâ (a) the final levy return wages are not included in the wages paid or payable for the financial year; and (b) the part of the periodic levy liability amount attributable to the final levy return wages (the \"final levy return liability\") is not included in the employerâs combined periodic liability for the financial year; and (c) the employer is taken not to have paid, or been liable to pay, wages for the days in the final period on which the employer paid, or was liable to pay, the final levy return wages. (5) Subsection (6) applies ifâ (a) the employer is the DGE for a group on 30 June in the financial year; and (b) under section 64 (2) or (5), a person lodged, or was required to lodge, a final return for a final period during the financial year stating the personâs final levy liability or final levy refund amount for the final period; and (c) the stated final levy liability or final levy refund amount was calculated wholly or partly with reference to wages paid or payable by a person during the final period ( \"final levy return wages\"). (6) For working out the DGEâs annual levy liability for the financial yearâ (a) the final levy return wages are not included in the wages paid or payable by members of the group for the financial year; and (b) the part of the periodic levy liability amount attributable to the final levy return wages (the \"final levy return liability\") is not included in the DGEâs combined periodic liability for the financial year; and (c) the person mentioned in subsection (5) (c) is taken not to have paid, or been liable to pay, taxable wages or interstate wages, or taxable wages and interstate wages, as a member of the group for the days in the final period on which the person paid, or was liable to pay, the final levy return wages. (7) Subsections (2) to (6) do not apply in relation to a final period during the financial year ifâ (a) the commissioner makes an original assessment of the employerâs annual levy liability, other than under the Administration Act, section 14 (a); and (b) the employer is not a group member on 30 June in the year; and (c) the employer was not a group member during the final period; and (d) the employerâs annual levy liability would be greater if the final levy return wages and final levy return liability for the final period were not included.

However, if a relevant entity\n                    had a direct interest in corporation C\n                    only, the entity would not have an\n                    indirect interest in corporation D\n                    because corporation D is not linked to\n                    corporation C.\n     (3) The value of a relevant entityâs indirect interest in a\n     corporation (the\n     \"indirectly controlled corporation\") that is linked to a directly\n     controlled corporation is the percentage worked out by multiplying\n     the following amountsâ\n          (a) the value of the relevant entityâs direct interest in\n          the directly controlled corporation;\n          (b) the value of each direct interest that forms a link in\n          the chain of corporations by which the indirectly\n          controlled corporation is linked to the directly controlled\n          corporation.\n          Examplesâ\n                    1 A relevant entity has a direct\n                    interest (with a value of 80%) in\n                    corporation A. Corporation A has a\n                    direct interest (with a value of 70%)\n                    in corporation B. The value of the\n                    relevant entityâs indirect interest\n                    in corporation B is 80% x 70% = 56%.\n                    For section 72, the relevant entity has\n                    a controlling interest in corporation\n                    B.\n                    2 Corporation B also has a direct\n                    interest (with a value of 40%) in\n                    corporation C. The value of the\n                    relevant entityâs indirect interest\n                    in corporation C is 80% x 70% x 40% =\n                    22.4%. For section 72, the relevant\n                    entity does not have a controlling\n                    interest in corporation C.\nAggregate interest"
