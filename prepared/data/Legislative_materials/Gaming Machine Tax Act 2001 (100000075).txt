GAMING MACHINE TAX ACT 2001
Section 14
Annual rate for registered clubs
 
 
14 Annual rate for registered clubs
     (1) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in a tax year do not exceed $200,000, no tax is
     payable on the profits.
     (2) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in a tax year exceed $200,000, but do not exceed
     $1,000,000, the following provisions apply--
          (a) in the 2006 tax year--tax is payable on so much of
          those profits as exceeds $200,000 at the rate of tax rate 1
          for the tax year,
          (b) in the 2007 tax year and subsequent tax years--no tax
          is payable on the profits.
     (3) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in a tax year exceed $1,000,000, but do not exceed
     $1,800,000, the following provisions apply--
          (a) in the 2006 tax year--tax is payable on $800,000 of
          those profits at the rate of tax rate 1 for the tax year,
          and on so much of those profits as exceeds $1,000,000 at
          the rate of tax rate 2 for the tax year,
          (b) in the 2007 tax year and subsequent tax years, tax is
          payable--
               (i) on the taxable component of the first
               $1,000,000 of those profits at the rate of tax
               rate 1 for the tax year, and
               (ii) on so much of those profits as exceeds
               $1,000,000 at the rate of tax rate 2 for the tax
               year.
     (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the
     "taxable component" of the first $1,000,000 of the profits of a
     registered club from gaming machines kept on the premises of the club
     is $1 for every $1 by which profits from all gaming machines kept on
     the premises of the registered club in the tax year exceeds
     $1,000,000.
          Note--: The taxable component of the first $1,000,000 of
          the profits of the registered club from gaming machines
          will vary from $1 (for a club that has profits of
          $1,000,001) to $800,000 (for a club that has profits of
          $1,800,000). The first $200,000 of profits is always tax
          free.
          Example. If the profits of a club from all gaming machines
          kept on the premises is $1,200,000, the taxable component
          of the first $1,000,000 of the profits is $200,000.
          Accordingly tax is payable on $200,000 of the first
          $1,000,000 of those profits at tax rate 1 and on the
          profits that exceed $1,000,000 (ie $200,000) at tax rate 2.
     (5) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in a tax year exceed $1,800,000, but do not exceed
     $5,000,000, tax is payable--
          (a) on $800,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate 1
          for the tax year, and
          (b) on so much of those profits as exceeds $1,000,000 at
          the rate of tax rate 2 for the tax year.
     (6) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in a tax year exceed $5,000,000, but do not exceed
     $10,000,000, tax is payable--
          (a) on $800,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate 1
          for the tax year, and
          (b) on $4,000,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate
          2 for the tax year, and
          (c) on so much of those profits as exceeds $5,000,000 at
          the rate of tax rate 3 for the tax year.
     (7) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in a tax year exceed $10,000,000, but do not exceed
     $20,000,000, tax is payable--
          (a) on $800,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate 1
          for the tax year, and
          (b) on $4,000,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate
          2 for the tax year, and
          (c) on $5,000,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate
          3 for the tax year, and
          (d) on so much of those profits as exceeds $10,000,000 at
          the rate of tax rate 4 for the tax year.
     (8) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in a tax year exceed $20,000,000, tax is payable--
          (a) on $800,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate 1
          for the tax year, and
          (b) on $4,000,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate
          2 for the tax year, and
          (c) on $5,000,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate
          3 for the tax year, and
          (d) on $10,000,000 of those profits at the rate of tax rate
          4 for the tax year, and
          (e) on so much of those profits as exceeds $20,000,000 at
          the rate of tax rate 5 for the tax year.
     (9) This section is subject to Part 4.
 

GAMING MACHINE TAX ACT 2001
Section 15
Instalment rate for registered clubs
 
 
15 Instalment rate for registered clubs
     (1) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in an instalment period do not exceed $50,000, no
     instalment is payable.
     (2) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in an instalment period exceed $50,000, but do not
     exceed $250,000, the following provisions apply--
          (a) for the 2006 tax year--the instalment payable is the
          amount determined by multiplying the amount by which those
          profits exceed $50,000 by tax rate 1 for the tax year,
          (b) for any subsequent tax year--no instalment is payable.
     (3) If the profits from all gaming machines kept on the premises of a
     registered club in an instalment period exceed $250,000, the
     instalment payable is the amount calculated as follows--
          (a) calculate the notional annual profits of the club by
          multiplying the profits from all gaming machines kept on
          the premises of the registered club in the instalment
          period by 4,
          (b) calculate the amount of tax that would be payable for
          the tax year on the notional annual profits of the club (as
          if the notional annual profits of the club were the total
          profits in the tax year from all gaming machines kept on
          the premises of the registered club),
          (c) calculate the instalment payable by dividing the amount
          calculated at paragraph (b) by 4.
     (4) For the purpose of calculating the amount referred to in
     subsection (3) (b), a number specified in the Table to section 15A as
     tax rate 2, 3, 4 or 5 for the tax year is taken to be reduced by
     1.85.
          Note--: The purpose of the reduction under this subsection
          is to take account of any annual rebate that may be
          available under Part 4. For example, tax rate 2 becomes
          18.05, instead of 19.9.
     (5) Despite anything to the contrary in this section, the remainder
     of any tax that, under this Division, remains payable in respect of
     the whole of a tax year is payable at the time of payment of the last
     instalment for the year.
     (6) Subsection (5) does not affect any provision of the Taxation
     Administration Act 1996 or any arrangement that may be entered into
     under that Act for the payment or compromise of any debt.

The ClubGRANTS Local Committee for each area of the State in which such a

ClubGRANTS guidelines, in a newspaper circulating throughout the State and in
newspapers circulating in regions of the State, that registered clubs are
seeking applications for community development and support projects.
5 Grants to be accounted for
A registered club claiming a reduction under Part 4 must--
     (a) take such steps as the ClubGRANTS guidelines may prescribe to
     ascertain, from the recipients of any money applied by the club to
     community development and support projects, the manner in which the
     money was applied, and
     (b) verify, by statutory declaration of some appropriate person or in
     such other manner as the ClubGRANTS guidelines may prescribe, all

          that person existing before the date of its publication, or
          (b) to impose liabilities on any person (other than the
          State or an authority of the State) in respect of anything
          done or omitted to be done before the date of its
          publication.
Part 2 - Provisions consequent on enactment of this Act 2 Existing liability to
pay duty in respect of gaming machines

     entitlement to a rebate of duty, under those provisions that existed
     immediately before their repeal took effect.
     (2) The repealed provisions are taken to continue to apply to and in
     respect of--

time that commenced before the repeal took effect, and any such liability is
taken to continue as though the provision had not been repealed.

     or club at a bank or financial institution, amounts payable as or in
     respect of duty under the repealed provisions, by force of this
     clause has effect to permit similar appropriations by the Chief
     Commissioner for the purpose of collecting tax.
5 Expenditure guidelines in connection with rebate
Guidelines published under section 87 of the Registered Clubs Act 1976, as in
