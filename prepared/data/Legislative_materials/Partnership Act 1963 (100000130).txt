Section 7
Rules for determining existence of partnership 
     (1)     In determining whether a partnership does or does not exist, regard
shall be had to subsections (2) to (4).
     (2)     Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, joint property or part ownership
does not, of itself, create a partnership as to anything so held or owned,
whether the tenants or owners do or do not share any profits made by the use of
the thing so held or owned.
     (3)     The sharing of gross returns does not, of itself, create a
partnership, whether the persons sharing the returns have or have not a joint or
common right or interest in any property from which, or from the use of which,
the returns are derived.
     (4)     The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is
evidence that the person is a partner with respect to the business, but the
receipt of such a share, or of a payment contingent on, or varying with, the
profits of a business, does not, of itself, make the person a partner with
respect to the business and, in particular--
         (a)     the receipt by a person of a debt or other liquidated demand by
instalments or otherwise out of the accruing profits of a business does not, of
itself, make the person a partner with respect to the business or liable as a
partner with respect to the business; and
         (b)     a contract for the remuneration of an employee or agent of a person
engaged in a business by a share of the profits of the business does not, of
itself, make the employee or agent a partner in relation to the business or
liable as a partner in relation to the business; and 
         (c)     a domestic partner or child of a deceased partner who receives, by way
of periodical payment, a part of the profits made in a business is not, only
because the domestic partner or child receives part of the profits, a partner in
relation to the business or liable as a partner in relation to the business;
and
         (d)     the lending of money to a person engaged or about to engage in a
business under a contract, made in writing with that person and signed by or on
behalf of all the parties to the contract, by virtue of which the lender is
entitled to receive a rate of interest varying with, or a share of, the profits
arising from carrying on the business, does not, of itself, make the lender a
partner with the person carrying on the business or liable as a partner with
that person; and
         (e)     a person who receives by way of periodical payment a portion of the
profits of a business in consideration of the sale by the person of the goodwill
of the business is not, by reason only of the receipt of that portion, a partner
with respect to the business or liable as a partner with respect to the
business.
     (5)     This section does not apply in relation to an incorporated limited
partnership.

for the partnership in the particular matter; and

3     Legislation
history
This Act was originally a Commonwealth ordinance--the Partnership Ordinance 1963
 No 5 (Cwlth).
The Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988
 (Cwlth), s 34 (4) converted most former Commonwealth
ordinances in force in the ACT into ACT enactments. This allowed the ACT
Legislative Assembly to amend and repeal the laws. This Act was converted into
an ACT enactment on 11 May 1989 (self-government day).
As with most ordinances in force in the ACT, the name was changed from
Ordinance to Act by the Self-Government (Citation of Laws) Act 1989 
 A1989-21, s 5 on 11 May 1989 (self-government day).
Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on their notification day unless
otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910
 (Cwlth), s 12).
