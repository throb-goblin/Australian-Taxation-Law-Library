     (h) the creation or termination of a trust of dutiable property;

               termination of trusts).
     (i) a trust acquisition or trust surrender.
          Noteâ

               concepts about trust acquisitions and trust
               surrenders).
     (2) It does not matter whether a dutiable transactionâ

               imposition of duty if a transaction constitutes
               more than 1 type of dutiable transaction
               mentioned in subsection (1).
               Also, for when transactions for particular

     the entity in which the property was previously vested.
     (5) However, property is not vested under statute law, on the
     registration of a company under the Corporations Act, chapter 5B,

     consideration is the total amount.
          Noteâ
               For other provisions relevant to consideration,
               see sections 501 to 503.
 
Consideration for dutiable transactionâtransfer by way of security
*** 13 Consideration for dutiable transactionâtransfer by way of security ***
The consideration for the transfer by way of security of dutiable property that
is land is an amount equal to the unencumbered value of the dutiable property
when the liability for transfer duty arises.
 
What is the unencumbered value of property
*** 14 What is the unencumbered value of property ***
     (1) The
     "unencumbered value" of property is the value of the property
     determined without regard toâ
          (a) any encumbrance to which the property is subject,
          whether contingently or otherwise; or
          (b) any arrangementâ
               (i) the parties to which are not dealing with
               each other at armâs length; and
               (ii) that results in the reduction of the value
               of the property; or
          (c) any arrangement for which a significant purpose of any
          party to the arrangement was, in the commissionerâs
          opinion, the reduction of the value of the property.
               Example for paragraph (c)â
                    A owns land that B wishes to purchase.
                    The land is valued at $1m. Before the
                    purchase, A grants B a 50 year lease of
                    the land. B is not required to pay any
                    rent under the lease. A and B then
                    enter into an agreement to transfer the
                    land for $50,000, being the value of
                    Aâs interest in the land taking into
                    account that it is subject to the lease
                    to B.
                    The unencumbered value of the land is
                    determined without regard to the grant
                    of the lease if the commissioner is of
                    the opinion there is an arrangement
                    under which A or Bâs significant
                    purpose in entering into it was to
                    reduce the value of the land.
     (2) Also, the
     "unencumbered value" of property held on trust or by a partnership
     must be determined without regard to the liabilities of the trust or
     partnership, including for a trust, the liability to indemnify the
     trustee.
     (3) The
     "unencumbered value" of property that is the goodwill of a business
     includes the value of any restraint of trade arrangement entered into
     by the transferor or a related person of the transferor to protect
     the value of the goodwill acquired by the transferee.
     (4) If, before a dutiable transaction mentioned in section 9 (1) (a),
     (b) or (d) for which the dutiable property is land, improvements are
     made to the land at the transfereeâs expense, the unencumbered
     value of the land must be determined as if the improvements had not
     been made.
          Noteâ
               For provisions about the aggregate minimum value
               of the shares comprising all of the issued
               capital of a corporation or society and the
               unencumbered value of each of the shares, see
               section 504.
 
When unencumbered value of property is determined
*** 15 When unencumbered value of property is determined ***
The unencumbered value of dutiable property is determinedâ
     (a) for a dutiable transaction that is the surrender of the
     propertyâimmediately before the surrender; or
     (b) for another dutiable transactionâwhen the liability for
     transfer duty arises.
 
When liability for transfer duty arises
*** 16 When liability for transfer duty arises ***
A liability for transfer duty imposed on a dutiable transaction in schedule 2,
column 1, arises at the time stated opposite the transaction in schedule 2,
column 2.
     Noteâ
          In relation to a dutiable transaction that is an ELN
          transfer or ELN lodgement, see also sections 156H and 156K.
 
Who is liable to pay transfer duty
*** 17 Who is liable to pay transfer duty ***
     (1) Transfer duty imposed on a statutory dutiable transaction must be
     paid by the statutory entity under the transaction.
     (2) Transfer duty imposed on another dutiable transaction must be
     paid by the parties to the transaction.
 
Need for instrument, ELN transaction document or statement
*** 18 Need for instrument, ELN transaction document or statement ***

transaction document, the parties liable to pay transfer duty on the
transaction must make a statement in the approved form (a
"transfer duty statement") within the time stated in section 19 for lodging the
statement.
     Penalty--
          Maximum penaltyâ40 penalty units.
 
Lodging instrument, ELN transaction document or statement
*** 19 Lodging instrument, ELN transaction document or statement ***
     (1) The statutory entity under a statutory dutiable transaction must
     lodgeâ
          (a) the instrument or ELN transaction document that effects
          or evidences the transaction; or
          (b) the transfer duty statement for the transaction.
     (2) The statutory entity must comply with subsection (1) â
          (a) within 60 days after the liability arises to pay
          transfer duty on the transaction; or
          (b) if the amount payable for the transaction is to be
          decided by a court or tribunalâwithin 14 days after the
          amount is decided.
     (3) The parties liable to pay transfer duty relating to another
     dutiable transaction must, within 30 days after the liability arises,
     lodgeâ
          (a) the instrument or ELN transaction document that effects
          or evidences the transaction or transfer duty statement for
          the transaction; and
          (b) an approved form for the transaction.
 
Effect of making or lodging instrument, ELN transaction document or statement
by 1 party
*** 20 Effect of making or lodging instrument, ELN transaction document or
statement by 1 party ***
The making of a transfer duty statement, or the lodging under section 19 of an
instrument, ELN transaction document or transfer duty statement, by 1 of the
parties to the dutiable transaction relieves the other parties to the
transaction from complying with the requirement to make the statement under
section 18 or lodge the instrument, ELN transaction document or transfer duty
statement under section 19.
 
No double dutyâgeneral
*** 21 No double dutyâgeneral ***
     (1) If a transaction for property constitutes more than 1 dutiable
     transaction for the property and imposition of transfer duty on all
     of the dutiable transactions for the property would result in
     transfer duty being imposed more than once on the transaction, the
     commissioner must decide the dutiable transaction on which transfer
     duty is imposed.
          Notesâ
                    1 For objections and appeals against
                    assessments of duty, see the
                    Administration Act, part 6.
                    2 For a dutiable transaction that is an
                    ELN transfer or ELN lodgement, see also
                    part 15, division 2.
     (2) For subsection (1), the commissioner must decide the dutiable
     transaction that is the most applicable dutiable transaction having
     regard to the provisions of this chapter and the primary purpose of
     the transaction.
 
No double dutyâparticular dutiable transactions
*** 22 No double dutyâparticular dutiable transactions ***
     (1) If transfer duty is imposed on a dutiable transaction for
     periodical payments of consideration, no duty is imposed under this
     Act on any agreement securing the periodical payments.
     (2) If transfer duty imposed on a dutiable transaction that is an
     agreement for the transfer of dutiable property is paid, no transfer
     duty is imposed on the transfer of the property to the transferee
     under the agreement.
          Noteâ
               For a dutiable transaction that is an ELN
               transfer or ELN lodgement, see also part 15,
               division 2.
     (2A) Also, if a payment commitment is made for a dutiable transaction
     that is an agreement for the transfer of dutiable property, no
     transfer duty is imposed on an ELN transfer of the dutiable property
     to the transferee under the agreement.
          Notesâ
                    1 For a dutiable transaction that is an
                    ELN transfer, see also part 15,
                    division 2.
                    2 See part 15, division 3 in relation
                    to the making of a payment commitment
                    for an agreement for the transfer of
                    dutiable property.
     (3) If the commissioner is satisfiedâ
          (a) a person (the
          "agent") is appointed in writing as an agent for another
          person (the
          "principal"); and
          (b) under the appointment, the agent enters into a dutiable
          transaction that is an agreement for the transfer of
          dutiable property from a person (the
          "original transferor") to the agent on behalf of the
          principal (the
          "agreement"); and
          (c) the principal provided all the consideration, including
          any deposit paid; and
          (d) transfer duty imposed on the agreement is paid; and
          (e) the dutiable property is later transferred to the
          principal by the original transferor or the agent (the
          "agency transfer");
     no transfer duty is imposed on the agency transfer or the trust
     acquisition or trust surrender by the principal because of the
     agreement or agency transfer.
     (4) For subsection (3) (a), the commissioner must not be satisfied
     the person was properly appointed as agent unless the original
     instrument of appointment, or a copy of it, is lodged.
     (5) Ifâ
          (a) there is an agreement for the transfer of dutiable
          property (the
          "first agreement"); and
          (b) after the first agreement takes place, 1 or more
          agreements to transfer all or part of the dutiable property
          the subject of the first agreement takes place (the
          "intervening agreements"); and
          (c) to give effect to the first agreement and the
          intervening agreements, 1 or more transfers of dutiable
          property (the
          "transfers") are effected by 1 or more parties to the first
          agreement and the intervening agreements; and
          (d) transfer duty imposed on the first agreement and the
          intervening agreements is paid;
     no transfer duty is imposed on the transfers.
          Example for subsection (5)â
               On 1 July, under an agreement for transfer, A
               agrees to sell land in Queensland to B for
               $100,000. Settlement is to take place on 31 July.
               On 7 July, under an agreement for transfer, B
               agrees to sell the land to C for $120,000. Again,
               settlement is to take place on 31 July. Before 31
               July, B directs A, that at settlement, A transfer
               the land to C.
               The agreement between A and B is the first
               agreement. The agreement between B and C is the
               intervening agreement. No transfer duty is
               imposed on the transfer from A to C if transfer
               duty on the first and intervening agreements has
               been paid.
 
When credit to be allowed for duty paid
*** 23 When credit to be allowed for duty paid ***
     (1) If section 14 (1) (c) is applied to determine the value of land
     because of a lease or occupancy right, in assessing the transfer duty
     payable for the dutiable transaction that is the transfer, or
     agreement for the transfer, of the land, a credit must be allowed for
     any lease duty paid under repealed chapter 4 for the lease or right.
     (2) Subsection (3) applies ifâ
          (a) transfer duty is paid on a dutiable transaction that is
          an option to acquire dutiable property (the
          "first transaction"); and
          (b) on the exercise of the option, transfer duty is payable
          on the dutiable transaction for the acquisition of the
          dutiable property (the
          "later transaction"); and
          (c) under the option, the consideration paid for the option
          is part of the consideration for the later transaction.
     (3) In assessing the transfer duty on the later transaction, a credit
     must be allowed for the transfer duty paid for the first transaction.
     (4) In this sectionâ

     "repealed chapter 4" means chapter 4 (Lease duty) as it was in force
     from time to time before its repeal by the Revenue Legislation
     Amendment Act 2005.

     dutiable transaction for or relating to, or the unencumbered value
     of, dutiable property that is a Queensland business asset, other than
     a debt or personal property, of a Queensland business that has its

     (3) However, the commissioner may decide the consideration for the
     dutiable transaction or the unencumbered value of the dutiable
     property on another basis if the commissioner is satisfied the other
     basis would be more appropriate in particular circumstances.

*** 27 Apportionmentâhead office or principal place of business in another
State ***
     (1) This section applies for determining the consideration for a
     dutiable transaction for or relating to, or the unencumbered value
     of, dutiable property that is a Queensland business asset, other than
     a debt or personal property, of a Queensland business that does not

*** 28 Apportionment of particular dutiable transactions relating to existing
and new rights ***

     another basis if the commissioner is satisfied the other basis would
     be more appropriate in particular circumstances.
 
When transaction for chattel is not dutiable transaction
*** 29 When transaction for chattel is not dutiable transaction ***
     (1) If a chattel in Queensland is the subject of a transaction, the
     transaction is not a dutiable transaction unlessâ
          (a) another type of dutiable property is the subject of the
          same transaction; or
          (b) under section 30, it is aggregated with a dutiable
          transaction that is not for a chattel.
     (2) For subsection (1) (b), section 30 applies as if the transaction
     were a dutiable transaction.
 
Aggregation of dutiable transactions
*** 30 Aggregation of dutiable transactions ***
     (1) This section applies to dutiable transactions that together form,
     evidence, give effect to or arise from what is, substantially 1
     arrangement.
     (2) For assessing transfer duty on each of the dutiable transactions,
     the transactions must be aggregated and treated as a single dutiable
     transaction.
          Example for subsection (2)â
               A conducts a business of manufacturing bullbars.
               A agrees to sell the business to B as a going
               concern for $50,000,000. The property included in
               the agreement comprises land, plant and
               equipment, goodwill and the business name.
               The land is dutiable property being land in
               Queensland and each of the other assets are
               dutiable property being Queensland business
               assets.
               The agreement, so far as it relates to the sale
               of the land, is a dutiable transaction being an
               agreement to transfer land in Queensland and, so
               far as it relates to the agreement to sell each
               of the business assets, is a dutiable transaction
               being an agreement to transfer dutiable property
               that is a Queensland business asset. Accordingly,
               there are 4 dutiable transactions under the
               agreement.
               Because the dutiable transactions together form 1
               arrangement, they must be aggregated under this
               section for imposing transfer duty.
     (3) For subsection (1), all relevant circumstances relating to the
     dutiable transactions must be taken into account in deciding whether
     they together form, evidence, give effect to or arise from what is,
     substantially 1 arrangement.
     (4) For subsection (3), relevant circumstances include the
     followingâ
          (a) whether the transactions are contained in 1 instrument;
          (b) whether any of the transactions are conditional on
          entry into, or completion of, any of the other
          transactions;
          (c) whether the parties to any of the transactions are the
          same;
          (d) whether any party to a transaction is a related person
          of another party to any of the other transactions;
          (e) the time over which the transactions take place;
          (f) whether, before the transactions take place, the
          dutiable property the subject of the transactions was used
          together, or dependently with one another, by the
          transferor or transferors;
          (g) whether, after the transactions take place, the
          dutiable property the subject of the transactions will be
          used together, or dependently with one another, by the
          transferee or transferees.
     (5) Transfer duty imposed on the dutiable transaction aggregated
     under this section mustâ
          (a) be assessed on the total of the dutiable values of the
          transactions when the liability for transfer duty for each
          of the transactions arose; and
          (b) be apportioned between the transactions as decided by
          the commissioner.
          Example for subsection (5)â
               Under 4 agreements between a builder and a
               developer, the builder agrees to purchase 4 lots
               of land from the developer for $100,000 each. The
               lots are dutiable property being land in
               Queensland and each of the agreements is a
               dutiable transaction being an agreement to
               transfer land in Queensland.
               Even though the sale of the 4 lots was negotiated
               at the same time, the agreements were signed on
               different dates over a 10 month period, had
               different settlement dates and were not
               conditional on each other.
               Under section 24 (Rates of transfer duty) and
               schedule 3 (Rates of duty on dutiable
               transactions and relevant acquisitions for
               landholder and corporate trustee duty), the
               agreements for lots 1 to 3 have been separately
               stamped for $2,350 transfer duty. When the
               agreement for lot 4 is lodged for stamping, the
               commissioner decides this section applies because
               the transactions together formed 1 arrangement.
               Accordingly, the transactions must be aggregated
               under this section for imposing transfer duty and
               the duty apportioned between them.
               Under subsection (5) (a), the total of the
               dutiable values of the dutiable transactions on
               which transfer duty is imposed is $400,000, being
               the value of each of the lots when the liability
               for transfer duty arose for each of the
               transactions, regardless of a variation in the
               values since the liability arose.
               Under section 24 and schedule 3, transfer duty
               imposed on the aggregated transaction is $12,475.
               If the commissioner decides to apportion the
               transfer duty equally between the dutiable
               transactions, the amount of transfer duty payable
               is $3,118.75 for each transaction.
               Under the Administration Act, part 3, the
               commissioner will make a reassessment for the
               transactions for lots 1 to 3. The assessment
               notice must state the matters mentioned in
               section 26 (2) of that Act.
     (6) Each party to each of the dutiable transactions must, when
     lodging the instrument, ELN transaction document or transfer duty
     statement relating to the transaction, give notice to the
     commissioner stating details known to the party aboutâ
          (a) all of the dutiable property included or to be included
          in the arrangement mentioned in subsection (1); and
          (b) the dutiable value of each dutiable transaction.
          Noteâ
               Under the Administration Act, the requirement
               under this subsection is a lodgement requirement
               for which a failure to comply is an offence under
               section 121 of that Act.
     (7) This section does not apply to a dutiable transaction to the
     extent that it relates to an exchange of dutiable property.
 
Partitions
*** 31 Partitions ***
     (1) This section applies to a dutiable transaction under which the
     following happens (the
     "partition")â
          (a) dutiable property held by persons jointly as joint
          tenants or tenants in common (each a
          "co-owner") is transferred, or agreed to be transferred, to
          1 or more of the co-owners;
          (b) the dutiable property transferred, or agreed to be
          transferred, includes the interest held by the transferee
          in the property immediately before the transaction.
     (2) The dutiable value of the dutiable transaction is the greater of
     the followingâ
          (a) the amount by which the unencumbered value of the
          dutiable property transferred, or agreed to be transferred,
          is more than the unencumbered value of the interest held by
          the transferee in the property immediately before the
          transaction;
          (b) the consideration paid by any party to the transaction.
     (3) This section does not apply to a transaction if section 48
     applies to the transaction.
 
Transfer by way of securityâland
*** 32 Transfer by way of securityâland ***
     (1) This section applies if the commissioner is satisfiedâ
          (a) there has been a dutiable transaction that is a
          transfer of dutiable property by way of security (the
          "original transfer"); and
          (b) the property is land; and
          (c) transfer duty has been paid on the transaction; and
          (d) the property has been retransferred to the person who
          transferred it by way of security (the
          "retransfer") or has been transferred to a person to whom
          the property has been transmitted by death or bankruptcy
          (also the
          "retransfer").
     (2) The commissioner must make a reassessment of transfer duty paid
     on the original transfer to reduce the duty to the amount that would
     have been payable if the amount secured by the transfer had been
     secured by a mortgage for which mortgage duty were imposed.
     (3) Transfer duty is not imposed on the dutiable transaction that is
     the retransfer.
     (4) Subsection (2) applies to the reassessment despite the limitation
     period under the Administration Act for reassessments.
          Noteâ
               See the Administration Act, part 3 (Assessments
               of tax), division 3 (Reassessments).
 
Transfer by way of securityâother dutiable property
*** 33 Transfer by way of securityâother dutiable property ***
     (1) Transfer duty is not imposed on a dutiable transaction ifâ
          (a) the transaction is a transfer of dutiable property by
          way of security; and
          (b) the property is not land.
     (2) Subsection (3) applies ifâ
          (a) after the transfer by way of security, the transferee,
          or the transfereeâs assignee, acquires ownership of the
          dutiable property free from any interest of the transferor,
          or transferorâs assignee; and
          (b) the transferee, or the transfereeâs assignee, were to
          newly acquire the dutiable property at the time of the
          acquisition mentioned in paragraph (a), the acquisition
          would be a dutiable transaction.
     (3) The acquisition of the ownership of the dutiable property by the
     transferee is taken to be a dutiable transaction and transfer duty
     imposed on the transaction must be reduced by the amount of mortgage
     duty, if any, paid on the transfer.

          (a) a business asset mentioned in subsection (1) (b) that
          is issued or given underâ
               (i) a Queensland Act is used for carrying on a
               business; or
               (ii) a Commonwealth Act is used for carrying on a
               business if it is used, exploited or exercised in
               Queensland; and
          (b) another business asset is used for carrying on a
          business if it is used, exploited or exercised in

What is a Queensland business
*** 36 What is a Queensland business ***
A
"Queensland business" is a businessâ
     (a) that is conducted on or from a place in Queensland; or
     (b) the conduct of which consists wholly or partly of supplying land,
     money, credit or goods or any interest in them, or providing any
     service, to Queensland customers; or
     (c) that has ceased but satisfied paragraph (a) or (b) at any time in
     the 1 year before a dutiable transaction that is the transfer, or
     agreement for the transfer, of an asset of the business.
          Example for paragraph (c)â
               A business conducted from a place in Queensland
               goes into liquidation. Three months after the
               business stops trading, the liquidator transfers
               business assets of the business. For determining
               whether the transfer of the business assets is a
               dutiable transaction, the business is a
               Queensland business because paragraph (a) was
               satisfied in the 1 year before the transfer.
 
When transaction for particular Queensland business assets not dutiable
transaction
*** 37 When transaction for particular Queensland business assets not dutiable

          negotiable instruments of the business.
     (2) If a supply right of a business is the subject of a transaction,
     the transaction is not a dutiable transaction unlessâ
          (a) another type of dutiable property is the subject of the

          transferred with all, or substantially all, of the supply
          rights of the business.
     (3) If intellectual or personal property of a business is the subject
     of a transaction, the transaction is not a dutiable transaction

          to transfer a Queensland business asset, other than trading
          stock of the business, to a person (the

          consignment for sale by a person, whether or not the new
          owner, (the
          "consignee") in the conduct of the business by the new
          owner; and
          (c) having regard to the terms of the consignment it is
          reasonable to conclude that the consignment is, or is part
          of, an arrangement to avoid transfer duty.
     (2) Without limiting subsection (1) (c), the terms of the consignment
     include the followingâ
          (a) the amount payable to the owner by the consignee and
          the terms of payment;
          (b) the price ultimately payable to the owner for the
          trading stock and the way in which it is worked out;
          (c) the basis of working out the consigneeâs commission;
          (d) the right of the consignee to mix the trading stock
          with other property not owned by the owner;
          (e) the right of the consignee to deal with the trading
          stock as if it were the consigneeâs or other than as
          agent of the owner.
     (3) The placing of the trading stock on consignment is taken to be a
     transfer of the stock.
          Noteâ
               Accordingly, the transfer is a dutiable
               transaction being the transfer of a Queensland
               business asset because trading stock is a
               business asset being personal property.
 
Surrender of Queensland business asset so replacement asset may be granted
*** 39 Surrender of Queensland business asset so replacement asset may be
granted ***
     (1) This section applies if a Queensland business asset is
     surrendered by a person (the
     "owner") so that a similar business asset may be granted, issued,
     given to or obtained by another person.
     (2) For imposing transfer dutyâ
          (a) the surrender is taken to be a transfer of the business
          asset by the owner to the other person when the similar
          business asset is granted, issued, given or obtained; and
          (b) the owner and other person are the parties to the
          dutiable transaction that is the transfer of the business
          asset.

     "partnership interest" isâ
          (a) if the partner has a variable partnership entitlement
          under subsection (2) âthe proportion that the value of
          the partnerâs entitlements as a partner bears to the
          value of the entitlements of all partners in the
          partnership expressed as a percentage; or
          (b) if the partner is entitled only to share in the profits
          of the partnership and has given or is required to give
          consideration, or has made or is required to make a
          contribution to the capital of the partnership, for the
          acquisition of the profit-sharing rightâthe partnerâs
          profit-sharing percentage; or
          (c) if paragraph (a) or (b) does not applyâthe greater of
          the followingâ
               (i) the percentage of the capital of the
               partnership the partner has contributed or is
               obliged to contribute;
               (ii) the percentage of the losses of the
               partnership the partner is required to bear.
     (2) For subsection (1) (a), a partner has a variable partnership
     entitlement in a partnership if, in the ordinary course of
     determining the partnerâs entitlement to share in the profits or
     obligation to contribute to the capital or losses of the partnership,
     the entitlement or obligation varies or may vary from time to time.
 
What is a partnershipâs indirect interest in dutiable property
*** 43 What is a partnershipâs indirect interest in dutiable property ***
A partnership has an
"indirect interest" in dutiable property ifâ
     (a) through a partnership interest or trust interest there is a
     connection between the partnership and dutiable property of the other
     partnership or trust; or
     (b) through a series of partnership interests or trust interests, or
     a combination of any of them, there is a connection between the
     partnership and dutiable property of a partnership or trust in the

Acquiring a partnership interest
*** 44 Acquiring a partnership interest ***
     (1) A person acquires a partnership interest if a partnership is
     formed or the personâs partnership interest increases.
     (2) Without limiting subsection (1) â
          (a) a partnership may be formed onâ
               (i) a change in the membership of a partnership;
               or
               (ii) the merger of 2 or more partnerships; or
          (b) a personâs partnership interest may increaseâ
               (i) under the terms of a partnership agreement;
               or
               (ii) on the retirement of a partner from a
               partnership; or
               (iii) on a change in the terms of a partnership
               agreement effecting a change in the interests of
               the partners.
     (3) However, a partnerâs variable partnership entitlement under
     section 42 does not increase ifâ
          (a) the partnerâs entitlement to share in the profits or
          obligation to contribute to the capital or losses of the
          partnership increases merely because of the partnerâs
          performance as a partner; and
          (b) there is no arrangement statingâ
               (i) the extent of the future variation to the
               partnerâs entitlement or obligation; or
               (ii) the consideration for the variation.
 
What is the dutiable value of a partnership acquisition
*** 45 What is the dutiable value of a partnership acquisition ***
The dutiable value of a partnership acquisition is the greater of the
followingâ
     (a) the consideration for the acquisition so far as the consideration
     relates to dutiable property, or an indirect interest in dutiable
     property, held by the partnership;
     (b) the value of the acquisition worked out under section 46 or 47.
 
What is the value of a partnership acquisitionâgeneral
*** 46 What is the value of a partnership acquisitionâgeneral ***
     (1) Subject to subsections (5) and (6), the value of a partnership
     acquisition is the total of the amounts worked out by applying the
     partnerâs partnership interest to the unencumbered value, when the
     liability for transfer duty arises, ofâ
          (a) the dutiable property held by the partnership (the
          "relevant partnership"); and
          (b) any indirect interest in dutiable property held by the
          relevant partnership.
     (2) For subsection (1) (b), the unencumbered value of an indirect
     interest under section 43 (a) of the relevant partnership is the
     amount worked out by applying to the unencumbered value of the
     dutiable property held by the entity in which the relevant
     partnership has a partnership or trust interest, the partnership or
     trust interest of the relevant partnership in that entity.
     (3) For subsection (1) (b), the unencumbered value of an indirect
     interest under section 43 (b) of the relevant partnership is the
     amount worked out byâ
          (a) first applying to the unencumbered value of the
          dutiable property held by the ultimate entity, the
          partnership or trust interest of the partnership or trust
          (the
          "last partner or beneficiary") that is a partner or
          beneficiary of the ultimate entity; and
          (b) applying to the amount worked out under paragraph (a),
          and the unencumbered value of any dutiable property held by
          the last partner or beneficiary, the partnership or trust
          interest of the next partnership or trust in the series of
          partnerships or trusts that is a partner or beneficiary of
          the last partner or beneficiary; and
          (c) applying the calculation in paragraph (b) for each of
          the other partnerships or trusts in the series until the
          first entityâs partnership interest or trust interest is
          used in the calculation; and
          (d) applying to the amount last worked out under paragraph
          (c) and the unencumbered value of any dutiable property
          held by the first entity, the partnership or trust interest
          of the relevant partnership.
     (4) Schedule 4 contains an example of how the value of a partnership
     acquisition is worked out.
     (5) For determining the value of a new partnerâs partnership
     acquisition on formation of a partnership, the value of any dutiable
     property the partner contributed to the partnership on its formation
     must be disregarded.
     (5A) For subsection (5), a person is a new partner only ifâ
          (a) the person was not in partnership with any partners of
          the partnership immediately before its formation; or
          (b) on the personâs partnership acquisition, the person
          becomes a partner in an additional partnership to a
          partnership in which the person is a partner with any
          partners of the additional partnership immediately before
          its formation.
     (5B) However, subsection (5A) (b) does not apply to a person who
     makes a partnership acquisition in a partnership that was formed
     because of a change in the membership of the partners of another
     partnership (the
     "old partnership") if the person had a partnership interest in the
     old partnership.
     (6) For determining the value of a partnerâs partnership
     acquisition that is an increase in the partnerâs partnership
     interest, the partnerâs partnership interest is taken to be the
     increase in the partnerâs partnership interest.
 
What is the value of a partnership acquisitionâmerger of 2 or more
partnerships
*** 47 What is the value of a partnership acquisitionâmerger of 2 or more
partnerships ***
     (1) This section applies ifâ
          (a) a person (the
          "partner") first makes a partnership acquisition (the
          "new partnership acquisition") on the merger of 2 or more
          partnerships; and
          (b) the person had a partnership interest (the
          "old partnership interest") in 1 of the merging
          partnerships; and
          (c) the partner were to make a partnership acquisition for
          the old partnership interest immediately before the merger,
          the value of the partnership acquisition would include all
          or part of the unencumbered value of dutiable property (the

          "continuing property") that becomes dutiable property of
          the merged partnership.
     (2) The value of the new partnership acquisition must be reduced by
     the lesser ofâ
          (a) the amount that would be the value of the new
          partnership acquisition if the dutiable property of the
          merged partnership comprised only the continuing property;
          or
          (b) the amount that represents the value of the partnerâs
          partnership acquisition for the old partnership interest
          mentioned in subsection (1) (c) immediately before the
          merger worked out as if the dutiable property of the former
          partnership comprised only the continuing property.
          Example for working out dutiable value under this
          sectionâ
               X is a 30% partner in the XYZ partnership that
               has dutiable property of $10m. The XYZ
               partnership merges with another partnership, to
               form a new partnership (the merged partnership).
               X has a 40% partnership interest in the merged
               partnership. The merged partnership has dutiable
               property with an unencumbered value of $12m,
               including $2m of the dutiable property of the XYZ
               partnership (the continuing property).
               The value of Xâs new partnership acquisition is
               worked out as followsâ
               Example â
                    Example--
                              1 The value of
                              Xâs interest in
                              the merged
                              partnership is
                              $4.8m, being 40%
                              (Xâs partnership
                              interest in the
                              merged partnership)
                              of $12m (the
                              unencumbered value
                              of the merged
                              partnershipâs
                              dutiable property).

                              under subsection
                              (2) (a) is
                              $800,000, being 40%
                              (Xâs partnership
                              interest in the
                              merged partnership)
                              of $2m (the
                              continuing
                              property).
                              3 The reduction
                              under subsection
                              (2) (b) is
                              $600,000, being 30%

                              interest in the XYZ
                              partnership) of $2m
                              (the continuing
                              property).
                         The value of Xâs
                         partnership acquisition is
                         $4.2m, being $4.8m less
                         $600,000 which is the lesser
                         of the amounts worked out
                         under subsection (2).
 
Dutiable value of dutiable transaction reduced for transfer of dutiable
property to partner on retirement or dissolution
*** 48 Dutiable value of dutiable transaction reduced for transfer of dutiable
property to partner on retirement or dissolution ***
     (1) This section applies if, on a person (the
     "retiring partner") ceasing to be a partner in a partnership because
     of the retiring partnerâs retirement from the partnership or its
     dissolution, dutiable property of the partnership is transferred or
     agreed to be transferred to the retiring partner.
     (2) The dutiable value of the dutiable transaction for the transfer,
     or agreement for the transfer, of the dutiable property to the
     retiring partner must be reduced by an amount worked out by applying
     the retiring partnerâs partnership interest in the partnership to
     the unencumbered value of the dutiable property immediately before
     the retirement or dissolution.
          Example for subsection (2)â
               A, B and C are in partnership in equal shares. B
               had a one-third partnership interest immediately
               before retiring. On B ceasing to be a partner, A
               and C transfer land to B. The dutiable value of
               the land acquired by B will be reduced by one-
               third.
 
Application of pt 8
*** 49 Application of pt 8 ***
     (1) This part applies to all expressly or intentionally created
     trusts, regardless of how they are created.
     (2) However, this part does not apply to a trust acquisition or trust
     surrender of a trust interest in a public unit trust other than a
     majority trust acquisition in a land holding trust.
          Notesâ

                    holding trusts) and 8 (Indirect trust
                    interests).
                    2 An acquisition of an interest in a
                    listed unit trust that is a landholder
                    may be dutiable under chapter 3, part 1
                    (Landholder duty).
 
Joint trustees
*** 50 Joint trustees ***
If a trust has 2 or more trustees, the trustees are taken to be a single person
for this chapter.

          for transfer duty payable.
 
Interpretation for property held by trust or partnership
*** 51 Interpretation for property held by trust or partnership ***
A reference to a trust or partnership holding property is a reference to the
holding of the property by the trustees on trust or the partners for the
partnership.
 
Contracted property and trust interests
*** 52 Contracted property and trust interests ***
     (1) For a trust, contracted property is taken to be dutiable property
     held by the trust.
     (1A) If a trust has made a purchase or sale agreement for a trust
     interest, the trust is taken to have an indirect interest in the
     trust-related dutiable property.
     (2) For determining the dutiable value of a trust creation, trust
     termination, trust acquisition or trust surrenderâ
          (a) a sale agreement made by the trustee is taken not to
          have been made; and
          (b) a purchase agreement made by the trustee is taken to
          have been completed.
     (3) Subsection (3A) applies ifâ
          (a) contracted property, or an indirect interest in
          dutiable property mentioned in subsection (1A), is included
          in determining the dutiable value of a trust creation,
          trust termination, trust acquisition or trust surrender;
          and
          (b) afterwards, the sale agreement for the property or
          trust interest is completed or the purchase agreement for
          the property or trust interest is not completed.
     (3A) The commissioner must make a reassessment as if the contracted
     property or indirect interest were never held by the trust.
     (4) For the reassessment, the parties liable to pay transfer duty on
     the trust creation, trust termination, trust acquisition or trust
     surrender must lodge the instruments required for the original
     assessment.
     (5) In this sectionâ

     "purchase agreement" includes an uncompleted agreement, whether or
     not conditional, for the acquisition of a trust interest through
     which the trust would have, if the agreement were completed, an
     indirect interest in dutiable property (the
     "trust-related dutiable property").

     "sale agreement" includes an uncompleted agreement, whether or not
     conditional, for the disposal of a trust interest through which the
     trust has an indirect interest in dutiable property (also the
     "trust-related dutiable property").
 
Creating trust of dutiable property
*** 53 Creating trust of dutiable property ***
     (1) A trust of dutiable property is created if a person, who has
     acquired property other than as trustee, starts to hold the property
     as trustee.
     (2) Also, a trust of dutiable property is created if all the
     following applyâ
          (a) a person holds dutiable property on trust (
          "trust 1");
          (b) the person is also trustee of another trust (
          "trust 2");
          (c) the person ceases to hold the dutiable property as
          trustee of trust 1 and starts to hold the dutiable property
          as trustee for trust 2;
          (d) when the person starts to hold the dutiable property as
          trustee for trust 2â
               (i) a person who has a trust interest for the
               dutiable property under trust 2 did not have a
               trust interest for that property when it was held
               for trust 1; or
               (ii) a person who has a trust interest for the
               dutiable property under trust 2 had a trust
               interest for that property when it was held for
               trust 1 and that personâs trust interest
               increases.

               to dutiable property.
 
Terminating trust of dutiable property
*** 54 Terminating trust of dutiable property ***
A trust of dutiable property is terminated if a person, having held the
property as trustee, starts to hold the property other than as trustee.
 
What is a trust acquisition
*** 55 What is a trust acquisition ***
A person makes a
"trust acquisition" if the person acquires a trust interest in a trust thatâ
     (a) holds dutiable property; or
     (b) has an indirect interest in dutiable property.
     Noteâ
          Under section 81, an indirect trust acquisition in a land
          holding trust is taken to be a trust acquisition. An
          indirect trust acquisition is the acquisition of an
          interest in a land holding trust through 1 or more
          corporations, partnerships or trusts, or a combination of
          any of them. See definitions
          "indirect trust acquisition" and
          "indirect trust interest" in the dictionary.
 
What is a trust surrender
*** 56 What is a trust surrender ***
A person makes a
"trust surrender" if the person surrenders a trust interest in a trust that
holds dutiable property or has an indirect interest in dutiable property.
 
What is a trust interest
*** 57 What is a trust interest ***
     (1) A
     "trust interest" is a personâs interest as a beneficiary of a
     trust, other than a life interest.
     (2) For a trust that is a discretionary trust, only a taker in
     default of an appointment by the trustee can have a trust interest.
     (3) Also, for a trust that is a superannuation fund, a member of the
     fund has a trust interest in the fund.
          Noteâ
               For exemption from transfer duty for a trust
               acquisition or surrender of a memberâs interest
               in a superannuation fund, see section 119.
 
What is a trustâs indirect interest in dutiable property
*** 58 What is a trustâs indirect interest in dutiable property ***
A trust has an
"indirect interest" in dutiable property ifâ
     (a) through a trust interest or partnership interest, there is a
     connection between the trust and dutiable property of the other trust
     or partnership; or
     (b) through a series of trust interests or partnership interests, or
     a combination of any of them, there is a connection between the trust
     and dutiable property of a trust or partnership in the series.
 
Acquiring a trust interest
*** 59 Acquiring a trust interest ***
     (1) A person acquires a trust interest ifâ
          (a) the person becomes a beneficiary of a trust, whether on
          creation of the trust or otherwise; or
          (b) being a beneficiary of a trust, the personâs trust
          interest increases, other than because of the surrender of
          another personâs trust interest in the trust for which
          transfer duty has been paid.
     (2) If a beneficiaryâs trust interest is subject to a prior life
     interest, the interest does not increase merely because the life
     tenant dies or, over time, the extent of the life interest reduces.
 
Beneficiaryâs trust interest is percentage of or proportionate to property
held on trust
*** 60 Beneficiaryâs trust interest is percentage of or proportionate to
property held on trust ***
     (1) A beneficiaryâs trust interest isâ
          (a) for a beneficiary who is a taker in default under a
          discretionary trustâ
               (i) the percentage of the trust income or trust
               property the beneficiary would receive in default
               of appointment by the trustee; or
               (ii) if the beneficiary would receive both trust
               income and trust property in default of
               appointment by the trustee, the greater
               percentage of the trust income or trust property
               the beneficiary would receive; or
          (b) for a beneficiary of a trust, other than a
          discretionary trust, whose entitlement is solely to income
          of the property held on trustâthe proportion that the
          value of the beneficiaryâs entitlement bears to the value
          of the entitlements of all beneficiaries expressed as a
          percentage; or
          (c) for another beneficiaryâthe proportion that the
          beneficiaryâs entitlement under the trust bears to the
          unencumbered value of the property held on trust expressed
          as a percentage.
     (2) For subsection (1) (c), the beneficiaryâs entitlement under the
     trust isâ
          (a) the amount of the unencumbered value of the property
          held on trust that the beneficiary could receive as a
          result of the acquisition of the beneficiaryâs trust
          interest determined at the time of acquisition of the
          interest; or
          (b) the entitlement stated in subsection (3) ifâ
               (i) the beneficiaryâs entitlement under the
               trust is not subject to a prior life interest;
               and
               (ii) the beneficiaryâs entitlement under the
               trust may increase, including from nothing, on
               the fulfilment of any condition, contingency or
               the exercise or non-exercise of any power or
               discretion; and
               (iii) the condition, contingency, power or
               discretion is part of an arrangement a
               significant purpose of which is to lessen the
               amount of the beneficiaryâs entitlement at a
               particular time.
     (3) For subsection (2) (b), the beneficiaryâs entitlement under the
     trust is the maximum interest in the property held on trust that the
     beneficiary would have on the fulfilment of the condition or
     contingency or the exercise or non-exercise of the power or
     discretion.
     (4) For a majority trust acquisition, a reference in this section to
     a beneficiaryâs entitlement under the trust includes the
     entitlement under the trust of related persons of the beneficiary.
 
Who is a related person
*** 61 Who is a related person ***
     (1) A person is a
     "related person" of another person ifâ
          (a) for individualsâthey are members of the same family;
          or
          (b) for an individual and a corporationâthe person or a
          member of the personâs family is a majority shareholder,
          director or secretary of the corporation or a related body
          corporate of the corporation, or has an interest of 50% or
          more in it; or
          (c) for an individual and a trusteeâthe person or a
          related person under another provision of this section is a
          beneficiary of the trust; or
          (d) for corporationsâthey are related bodies corporate;
          or
          (e) for a corporation and a trusteeâthe corporation or a
          related person under another provision of this section is a
          beneficiary of the trust; or
          (f) for trusteesâ
               (i) there is a person who is a beneficiary of
               both trusts; or
               (ii) a person is beneficiary of 1 trust and a
               related person under another provision of this
               section is a beneficiary of the other trust.
     (2) Also, a person is a
     "related person" of another person if the persons acquire trust
     interests in a land holding trust and the acquisitions form,
     evidence, give effect to or arise from what is substantially 1
     arrangement.
     (3) However, a person is not a
     "related person" of another person under subsection (1), other than
     subsection (1) (d), if the commissioner is satisfied the trust
     interests of the persons in a land holding trustâ
          (a) were acquired, and will be used, independently; and
          (b) were not acquired, and will not be used, for a common
          purpose.
 
What is the dutiable value of a trust acquisition or trust surrender
*** 62 What is the dutiable value of a trust acquisition or trust surrender ***
The dutiable value of a trust acquisition or trust surrender is the greater of
the followingâ
     (a) the consideration for the acquisition or surrender so far as the
     consideration relates to dutiable property, or an indirect interest
     in dutiable property, held by the trust;
     (b) the value of the acquisition or surrender worked out under
     section 63.
 
What is the value of a trust acquisition or trust surrender
*** 63 What is the value of a trust acquisition or trust surrender ***
     (1) Subject to subsections (6) to (8), the value of a trust
     acquisition or trust surrender is the total of the amounts worked out
     by applying the beneficiaryâs trust interest to the unencumbered
     value, when the liability for transfer duty arises, ofâ
          (a) the dutiable property held by the trust (the
          "relevant trust"); and
          (b) any indirect interest in dutiable property held by the
          relevant trust.
          Noteâ
               Under section 52 (1), dutiable property includes
               contracted property. Also, under section 52 (1A),
               the relevant trust may be taken to hold an
               indirect interest in dutiable property through a
               trust interest that is the subject of a purchase
               or sale agreement.
     (2) For subsection (1), the beneficiaryâs trust interest for a
     trust surrender is the beneficiaryâs trust interest immediately
     before the surrender.
     (3) For subsection (1) (b), the unencumbered value of an indirect
     interest under section 58 (a) of the relevant trust is the amount
     worked out by applying to the unencumbered value of the dutiable
     property held by the entity in which the relevant trust has a trust
     or partnership interest, the trust or partnership interest of the
     relevant trust in that entity.
     (4) For subsection (1) (b), the unencumbered value of an indirect
     interest under section 58 (b) of the relevant trust is the amount
     worked out byâ
          (a) first applying to the unencumbered value of the
          dutiable property held by the ultimate entity, the trust or
          partnership interest of the trust or partnership (the
          "last beneficiary or partner") that is a beneficiary or
          partner of the ultimate entity; and
          (b) applying to the amount worked out under paragraph (a),
          and the unencumbered value of any dutiable property held by
          the last beneficiary or partner, the trust or partnership
          interest of the next trust or partnership in the series of
          trusts or partnerships that is a beneficiary or partner of
          the last beneficiary or partner; and
          (c) applying the calculation in paragraph (b) for each of
          the other trusts or partnerships in the series until the
          first entityâs trust interest or partnership interest is
          used in the calculation; and
          (d) applying to the amount last worked out under paragraph
          (c) and the unencumbered value of any dutiable property
          held by the first entity, the trust or partnership interest
          of the relevant trust.
     (5) Schedule 4 contains an example of how the value of a trust
     acquisition is worked out.
     (6) For determining the value of a beneficiaryâs trust acquisition
     that is an increase in the beneficiaryâs trust interest, other than
     a majority trust acquisition, the beneficiaryâs trust interest is
     taken to be the increase in the beneficiaryâs trust interest.
     (7) Subsection (8) applies to a majority trust acquisition that is an
     increase in a beneficiaryâs trust interest (the
     "relevant trust acquisition") that has happened in the following
     circumstancesâ
          (a) the trust interest of the beneficiary and related
          persons of the beneficiary was 50% or more immediately
          before the relevant trust acquisition;
          (b) transfer duty was previously paid for a majority trust
          acquisition in the trust made by the beneficiary or related
          persons;
          (c) since the majority trust acquisition mentioned in
          paragraph (b), no other related person of the beneficiary
          has made a trust acquisition in the trust.
     (8) For determining the value of the beneficiaryâs trust
     acquisition that is the relevant trust acquisition, the
     beneficiaryâs trust interest is taken to be the increase in the
     beneficiaryâs trust interest.
 
Liability to pay transfer duty on creation or termination of trust
*** 64 Liability to pay transfer duty on creation or termination of trust ***
     (1) If a trust of dutiable property is created or terminated, the
     trustee of the trust is the party to the dutiable transaction that is
     the creation or termination of the trust.
     (2) If the trustee of the trust does not pay the transfer duty, the
     beneficiaries of the trust are jointly and severally liable for the
     duty.
 
Liability of joint trustees
*** 65 Liability of joint trustees ***
If a trust has 2 or more trustees, the trustees are jointly and severally
liable for any transfer duty imposed.
 
When no transfer duty on trust acquisition or trust surrender
*** 66 When no transfer duty on trust acquisition or trust surrender ***
     (1) If, because of the creation of a trust of dutiable property, a
     person acquires a trust interest in the property, transfer duty is
     not imposed on the acquisition ifâ
          (a) transfer duty has been paid for the dutiable
          transaction that is the creation of the trust of the
          property; or
          (b) the dutiable transaction that is the creation of the
          trust of the property is exempt from transfer duty.
     (2) If, because of the acquisition of dutiable property by a trust, a
     person acquires a trust interest in the property, transfer duty is
     not imposed on the acquisition of the trust interest ifâ
          (a) the trustee has paid transfer duty for the acquisition
          of the property; or
          (b) the dutiable transaction that is the acquisition of the
          property is exempt from transfer duty; or
          (c) duty is not imposed on the acquisition of the property
          by the trustee.
     (3) If, because of the termination of a trust of dutiable property, a
     person surrenders a trust interest in the property, transfer duty is
     not imposed on the surrender ifâ
          (a) transfer duty has been paid for the dutiable
          transaction that is the termination of the trust of the
          property; or
          (b) the dutiable transaction that is the termination of the
          trust of the property is exempt from transfer duty.
 
Parties to trust acquisition and trust surrender
*** 67 Parties to trust acquisition and trust surrender ***
     (1) For a trust acquisition, the beneficiary acquiring the trust
     interest is the party to the dutiable transaction.
     (2) For a trust surrender, the trustee and the beneficiary whose
     trust interest is surrendered are the parties to the dutiable
     transaction.
          Noteâ
               Under section 17, the parties to a dutiable
               transaction are liable to pay transfer duty
               imposed on the transaction.

     Notesâ
               1 Section 498A includes provision about when the

               2 An acquisition of an interest in a listed unit
               trust that is a landholder may be dutiable under
               chapter 3, part 1 (Landholder duty).
 
What is a widely held unit trust
*** 70 What is a widely held unit trust ***
     (1) A
     "widely held unit trust" is a unit trust, other than a listed unit
     trust, that is a registered managed investment scheme for whichâ
          (a) units in the trust have been issued to the public; and

               Also, under section 71, the commissioner may
               treat a unit trust as a widely held unit trust.
     (2) However, for a trust acquisition or trust surrender of a trust
     interest in a trust, a unit trust is not a widely held unit trust if
     subsection (1) (b) and (c) is not satisfied before and after the
     trust acquisition or trust surrender.
     (3) For subsection (2), a trust acquisition or trust surrender of a
     trust interest in a unit trust includes a series of trust
     acquisitions or trust surrenders under an arrangement.
     (4) If subsection (2) applies to a unit trust, the trust is not a
     widely held unit trust from immediately before the trust acquisition
     or trust surrender or the first acquisition or surrender under the
     arrangement.
     (5) For subsection (1), a person is taken to be beneficially entitled
     to all units held by the person and related persons of the person.
 
When unit trust may be treated as widely held unit trust
*** 71 When unit trust may be treated as widely held unit trust ***
     (1) This section applies if the commissioner is satisfiedâ
          (a) units in a unit trust (the
          "start up units") will be issued to the public to an extent
          and with the entitlements mentioned in section 70 (1)
          within 1 year after the first issue of units to the public;
          and
          (b) the start up units are the only units in the unit trust
          to be issued from and including the first issue to the
          public until the unit trust becomes a widely held unit
          trust (the
          "start-up period").
     (2) The commissioner may treat the unit trust as a widely held unit
     trust for the start-up period.
     (3) However, if the start-up units are not issued in the way
     mentioned in subsection (1) (a) or are not the only units issued in
     the unit trust in the start-up period (the
     "disqualifying circumstances")â
          (a) the trustee must, within 28 days after the
          disqualifying circumstances happen, give the commissioner
          notice about the disqualifying circumstances; and

          unit trust in the start-up period; and
          (c) the commissioner must make an assessment for transfer
          duty for each trust acquisition or trust surrender in the
          start-up period as if the trust were not a widely held unit
          trust in the period; and
          (d) the start date for the Administration Act, section 54
          (4), is 61 days after the relevant trust acquisition or
          trust surrender.
 
What is a wholesale unit trust
*** 72 What is a wholesale unit trust ***
     (1) A
     "wholesale unit trust" is a unit trust, other than a listed unit

          (b) the units in which are predominantly acquired by, for
          or on account of, wholesale investors.
     (2) A
     "wholesale unit trust" includes a unit trust that holds land in
     Queensland, or has an indirect interest in land in Queensland, only
     if the trust was established, and continues, solely for the
     investment of funds placed with it by wholesale investors using the
     funds managerâs funds management and investment services.
     (3) However, for a trust acquisition or trust surrender of a trust
     interest in a trust, a unit trust is not a wholesale unit trust ifâ
          (a) the trust is established or managed for a particular
          person; or
          (b) subsection (1) (b) or if applicable subsection (2) is

     trust interest in a unit trust includes a series of trust
     acquisitions or trust surrenders under an arrangement.

               funds managers as a competitor with them for the
               services; or

     corporate or corporate group will provide funds management and
     investment services to wholesale investors to the extent mentioned in
     subsection (1) (a) or (b) within the start-up period.
     (3) The commissioner may treat the body corporate as a funds manager
     for the start-up period.
     (4) However, if the body corporate or corporate group does not

          (a) the purpose of the transaction is to give effect to a
          scheme that qualifies or would, on its completion, qualify
          as a roll-over under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997
          (Cwlth), subdivision 124.Q; and
          (b) when the scheme is completed, the interposed trust will
          be a listed unit trust or a widely held unit trust; and
          (c) the transaction is not part of an arrangement to avoid
          the imposition of transfer duty.
     (2) Subsection (1) does not apply ifâ
          (a) the interposed trust is not a listed unit trust or a
          widely held unit trust when the scheme is completed; or

          interests in the stapled entities for at least 3 years
          after the date of the transaction.
     (3) Despite subsection (2) (c), subsection (1) continues to apply if
     the commissioner is satisfied the interposed trust did not retain all
     the ownership interests because 1 or more of the stapled entities
     ceased to exist other than under an arrangement, a significant
     purpose of which was to avoid the requirement to retain all the
     ownership interests for at least 3 years.
     (4) If subsection (1) does not apply, the commissioner must make a
     reassessment to impose transfer duty on the transaction as if the
     exemption from duty had never applied.
     (5) Subsection (4) applies to the reassessment despite the limitation
     period under the Administration Act for reassessments.
          Noteâ
               See the Administration Act, part 3, division 3.
     (6) If an event mentioned in subsection (2) happens, a party to the
     transaction must, within 28 days after the event happensâ
          (a) give notice of the event to the commissioner in the
          approved form; and
          (b) ensure the instruments required for the assessment of
          duty on the transaction are lodged for reassessment.
               Noteâ
                    Failure to give the notice is an
                    offence under the Administration Act,
                    section 120.
     (7) Without limiting subsection (3), a company registered under the
     Corporations Act ceases to exist if it is deregistered under that
     Act.

          the way provided under section 179B.
 
What is a relevant acquisition
*** 158 What is a relevant acquisition ***

          landholder duty was imposed, the personâs interest in the
          landholder increases.
     (2) To remove any doubt, it is declared that for subsection (1) (b),
     it is not relevant whether, immediately before the person acquires
     the interestâ
          (a) an interest mentioned in subsection (1) (b) (i) or (ii)
          is, of itself, a significant interest in the landholder; or
          (b) the aggregation of any interests mentioned in
          subsections (1) (b) (i) or (ii), of itself, amounts to a
          significant interest in the landholder.

Matters about applying ss 161 and 161A
*** 161B Matters about applying ss 161 and 161A ***
     (1) If the commissioner considers the application of section 161 (1)
     (b) or 161A (1) (b) would be inequitable, the commissioner may decide
     the entitlement of a person be based on a distribution carried out
     under section 161 (1) (a) or 161A (1) (a).
     (2) Also, if a person makes a relevant acquisition because interests
     are aggregated under section 158 (1) (b) (ii), the entitlements under
     section 161 (1) (b) or 161A (1) (b) of the person and the related

Acquiring an interest in a landholder
*** 162 Acquiring an interest in a landholder ***
     (1) A person acquires an interest in a landholder if the person

     landholder regardless of how it is obtained or increased.
     (2) Without limiting subsection (1), a person may acquire an interest
     in a landholder in the following waysâ
          (a) the purchase, gift, allotment or issue of a share or
          unit;
          (b) the cancellation, redemption or surrender of a share or
          unit;
          (c) the abrogation or alteration of a right for a share or
          unit;
          (d) the payment of an amount owing for a share or unit;
          (e) if the person holds an interest in the landholder,
          whether or not as trusteeâby changing the capacity in
          which the person holds the interest.
               Example of when the capacity in which a person
               holds an interest changesâ
                    A person holds a share or unit in a
                    corporation or listed unit trust other
                    than as trustee. The personâs
                    capacity changes if the person starts
                    holding the share or unit as trustee.
     (3) To remove any doubt, it is declared that an acquisition of shares
     or units is not necessary to acquire an interest in a landholder.

          paragraph (b) and 179B (2), definition excluded interest,
          paragraph (b), the landholder did not hold land in
          Queensland.
     (2) The person acquires the interestâ
          (a) if there is an agreement to acquire the interest,
          whether conditional or not, and paragraph (b) does not
          applyâwhen the agreement is made; or
          (b) if there is an agreement to acquire the interest,
          whether conditional or not, and the landholder is not a
          landholder when the agreement is made but is a landholder
          when the agreement is completedâwhen the agreement is
          completed; or
          (c) otherwiseâwhen the interest is acquired.
     (3) Also, ifâ
          (a) a person holds a security interest in a landholder; and
          (b) the acquisition of the security interest was an exempt
          acquisition under section 190; and
          (c) the person later acquires the interest free from any
          interest or equity of the previous holder of the interest
          (the
          "later acquisition");

          member of the personâs family is a majority shareholder,
          director or secretary of the corporation or a related body
          corporate of the corporation, or has an interest of 50% or
          more in it; or
          (c) for an individual and a trusteeâthe person or a
          related person under another provision of this section is a
          beneficiary of the trust; or
          (d) for corporationsâthey are related bodies corporate;
          or

          related person under another provision of this section is a
          beneficiary of the trust; or
          (f) for trusteesâ
               (i) there is a person who is a beneficiary of
               both trusts; or

     "related person" of another person if the persons acquire interests
     in a landholder and the acquisitions form, evidence, give effect to

     (3) However, a person is not a
     "related person" of another person under subsection (1), other than
     subsection (1) (d), if the commissioner is satisfied the interests of
     the personsâ
          (a) were acquired, and will be used, independently; and
          (b) were not acquired, and will not be used, for a common
          purpose.

     (2) Also, each of the following is a
     "subsidiary" of the holding entityâ
          (a) a trustee of a trust, if the holding entity or a
          subsidiary of the holding entity, whether under this or
          another subsection, is a beneficiary of the trust (a

               it is a subsidiary of A Pty Ltd.
               Under subsection (2) (a), C Pty Ltd is the
               subsidiary of A Pty Ltd because B, a subsidiary

     (3) In addition, a corporation or trustee of a trust is a
     "subsidiary" of a holding entity if, under subsection (1) or (2), it
     is a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the holding entity.
     (4) For subsection (1) (b), a corporation is a subsidiary of a listed
     unit trust if it is a subsidiary of the trust under the Corporations
     Act, chapter 1, part 1.2, division 6, appliedâ

     "land-holdings" includes the land-holdings, under subsection (1),
     held by the entity for a partnership of which the entity is a partner
     as if a reference in the subsection to land, an interest in land or
     rights, were a reference to land, an interest in land or rights held
     by the entity for the partnership.
     (3) Also, an entityâs
     "land-holdings" includes the land-holdings, under subsection (1) or
     (2), of a subsidiary of the entity as if a reference in the
     subsection to an entity were a reference to the subsidiary.

*** 168 What is an entityâs property ***
     (1) An entityâs

Value of co-owned land-holdings
*** 170 Value of co-owned land-holdings ***
     (1) If an entityâs land-holdings include land-holdings in which it
     has an interest as co-owner, the unencumbered value of the interests
     of all co-owners in the land-holdings must be included in working out
     the unencumbered value of the entityâs land-holdings for section
     165.
          Noteâ
               Even though the unencumbered value of the
               interests of all co-owners of the land-holdings
               is included for working out whether an entity is
               a landholder, only the unencumbered value of the
               entityâs interest in the land-holdings is used
               under division 4 for working out landholder duty
               imposed on the dutiable value of a relevant
               acquisition. See section 184.
     (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply if the commissioner is
     satisfied that the co-ownership is not intended to avoid the
     imposition of landholder duty.
 
Value of land-holdings in uncompleted agreement for transfer included

     transaction to which chapter 2, part 10, applies, business property
     taken to have no value under the part must be disregarded in working
     out the unencumbered value of the land-holdings or property of the
     entity.
     (2) For subsection (1), a repealed s 97 (1) (f) transaction is taken
     to be a dutiable transaction to which chapter 2, part 10, applies.

the acquisition is made.
 
Who is liable to pay landholder duty
*** 175 Who is liable to pay landholder duty ***
     (1) Landholder duty imposed on a relevant acquisition must be paid by
     the acquirer.
     (2) However, if a person makes a relevant acquisition because

*** 177 Landholder duty statement ***
The acquirer under a relevant acquisition, or for a relevant acquisition
mentioned in section 175 (2), the acquirer or the related persons of the
acquirer must within 30 days after the acquisition is made, lodge a statement

"landholder duty statement").
     Penalty--
          Maximum penaltyâ40 penalty units.
 
Effect of lodging landholder duty statement by acquirer or related person
*** 178 Effect of lodging landholder duty statement by acquirer or related
person ***
The lodging, under section 177, of a landholder duty statement by the acquirer
or a related person of the acquirer relieves the other person from complying
with the section.
 
Rate of landholder duty
*** 178A Rate of landholder duty ***
The rate of landholder duty imposed on the dutiable value of a relevant
acquisition made in a private landholder is the rate stated in schedule 3,
column 2, opposite the dutiable value stated in schedule 3, column 1.
 
Working out dutiable value of relevant acquisition
*** 179 Working out dutiable value of relevant acquisition ***
     (1) The dutiable value of a relevant acquisition in a private
     landholder is the interest in, or total of interests in, the
     landholder constituting the relevant acquisition, less any excluded
     interest of the person at the time of the acquisition, multiplied by
     the unencumbered value of all Queensland land-holdings of the
     landholder at the time of the acquisition.
          Noteâ
               See also section 14 (What is the
               "unencumbered value" of property).
     (2) Subsection (3) applies to the following relevant acquisitionsâ
          (a) a relevant acquisition mentioned in section 158 (1)
          (c);
          (b) a relevant acquisition made by a person in the
          following circumstancesâ
               (i) the person together with related persons of
               the person had a significant interest in the
               private landholder immediately before the
               relevant acquisition;
               (ii) the interests of the person and related
               persons were previously aggregated so that duty
               under subsection (1) was paid for a relevant
               acquisition in the private landholder;
               (iii) since the relevant acquisition mentioned in
               subparagraph (ii), no other related person of the
               person has acquired an interest in the
               landholder.
     (3) For applying subsection (1) to a relevant acquisition mentioned
     in subsection (2), the interest is the increased interest in the
     private landholder that is acquired by the person by the relevant
     acquisition.
          Examples for subsections (2) and (3)â
                    1 A and B are related persons. A holds
                    a 30% interest in a private landholder.
                    B acquires a 25% interest and, when
                    aggregated with Aâs interest, a
                    significant interest. If A acquires
                    another 5% bringing its interest to
                    35%, for working out the dutiable
                    value, the interest constituting the
                    relevant acquisition is 5%.
                    2 A and B are related persons. A holds
                    a 30% interest in a private landholder.
                    B acquires a 25% interest and, when
                    aggregated with Aâs interest, a
                    significant interest. If A acquires
                    Bâs 25% interest, for working out the
                    dutiable value, the interest
                    constituting the relevant acquisition
                    is 25%.
     (4) For applying subsection (1) to a relevant acquisition, the
     interest mentioned in section 409 (3) must be disregarded.
          Noteâ
               Under section 409 (3), landholder duty is not
               imposed on particular interests acquired under a
               corporate reconstruction.
     (5) This section has effect subject to a deduction allowed under
     sections 185 to 188.
     (6) In this sectionâ

     "excluded interest", of a person who makes a relevant acquisition in
     a private landholder, is any interest constituting the relevant
     acquisitionâ
          (a) held by the person, or a related person of the person,
          on or before the day that is 3 years before the relevant
          acquisition, unlessâ
               (i) the interest was acquired as part of an
               arrangement; and
               (ii) the arrangement includes the interest most
               recently acquired as part of the relevant
               acquisition; or
          (b) acquired by the person, or a related person of the
          person, at a time when the landholder did not hold land in
          Queensland.
 
Landholder duty
*** 179A Landholder duty ***
     (1) Subject to section 179B, the landholder duty imposed on a
     relevant acquisition made by a person in a public landholder is 10%
     of the amount of transfer duty that would be imposed on a dutiable
     transaction under chapter 2, if a transfer of all the Queensland
     land-holdings of the landholder had happened at the time of the
     relevant acquisition.
     (2) However, for a relevant acquisition to which section 158 (1) (c)
     applies, no landholder duty is imposed for an increase in the
     personâs interest ifâ
          (a) landholder duty for a relevant acquisition by the
          person in the landholder has previously been imposed under
          this section; and
          (b) since making the relevant acquisition for which
          landholder duty was imposed, the interest of the person
          constituting the previous acquisition has not reduced.
     (3) This section has effect subject to a deduction allowed under
     sections 185 to 188.
 
Dutiable value of dutiable transaction for s 179A
*** 179B Dutiable value of dutiable transaction for s 179A ***
     (1) For section 179A, in working out the amount of transfer duty that
     would be imposed under chapter 2, the dutiable value of the dutiable
     transaction is the unencumbered value of all Queensland land-holdings
     of the landholder at the time of the acquisition, reduced by the
     proportion of the value represented by any excluded interest of the
     person at the time of the acquisition.
     (2) In this sectionâ

     "excluded interest", of a person who makes a relevant acquisition in
     a public landholder, is any interest constituting the relevant
     acquisition acquired by the person, or a related personâ
          (a) before 1 July 2011; or
          (b) at a time when the landholder did not hold land in
          Queensland.
 
Aggregation of particular relevant acquisitions
*** 180 Aggregation of particular relevant acquisitions ***
     (1) This section applies for aggregating relevant acquisitions that
     together form, evidence, give effect to or arise from what is,
     substantially 1 arrangement if a person makes a relevant acquisition
     mentioned in section 179 (2).
     (2) For assessing landholder duty on each of the relevant
     acquisitions, the acquisitions must be aggregated and treated as a
     single relevant acquisition.
     (3) For subsection (1), all relevant circumstances relating to the
     relevant acquisitions must be taken into account in deciding whether
     they together form, evidence, give effect to or arise from what is,
     substantially 1 arrangement.
     (4) For subsection (3), relevant circumstances include the
     followingâ
          (a) whether any of the acquisitions are conditional on
          entry into, or completion of, any of the other
          acquisitions;
          (b) whether the parties to any of the acquisitions are the
          same;
          (c) whether any party to an acquisition is a related person
          of another party to any of the other acquisitions;
          (d) the time over which the acquisitions take place;
          (e) whether, after the acquisitions take place, the
          acquirersâ interests will be used together or dependently
          with one another;
          (f) whether, before the acquisitions take place, the
          interests were used together or dependently with one
          another.
     (5) Landholder duty imposed on the relevant acquisition aggregated
     under this section mustâ
          (a) be assessed on the total of the dutiable values of the
          acquisitions when the liability for landholder duty for
          each of the acquisitions arose; and
          (b) be apportioned between the acquisitions as decided by
          the commissioner.
     (6) The acquirer must, when lodging the landholder duty statement
     relating to the acquisition, give notice to the commissioner stating
     details known to the acquirer aboutâ
          (a) all of the interests of the acquirer and related
          persons of the acquirer included or to be included in the
          arrangement mentioned in subsection (1); and
          (b) the dutiable value of each relevant acquisition.
          Noteâ
               Under the Administration Act, the requirement
               under this subsection is a lodgement requirement
               for which a failure to comply is an offence under
               section 121 of that Act.
 
Unencumbered value of land-holdings of subsidiary of landholder
*** 182 Unencumbered value of land-holdings of subsidiary of landholder ***
     (1) This section applies for working out the unencumbered value of
     the Queensland land-holdings of a landholder under section 179 or
     179B, to the extent the land-holdings comprise land-holdings of a
     subsidiary of the landholder.
     (2) The unencumbered value of the Queensland land-holdings of the
     landholder is the proportion of the unencumbered value of the land-
     holdings in Queensland of all the subsidiaries to which the
     landholder would be entitled, if the subsidiaries, at the same time
     and without regard to their liabilitiesâ
          (a) for subsidiaries that are corporationsâwere wound up;
          or
          (b) for subsidiaries that are trustsâwere terminated.
     (3) For subsection (2), the unencumbered value of the Queensland
     land-holdings of the subsidiary on the winding up or termination of
     all the subsidiaries isâ
          (a) if the subsidiary is a corporation, the greatest
          proportion of the unencumbered value of the land-holdings
          in Queensland that the landholder would be entitled to
          under sections 161 (1) and 161B (1) applied as ifâ
               (i) a reference to a person were a reference to
               the landholder mentioned in this section; and
               (ii) a reference to a corporation were a
               reference to the subsidiary; or
          (b) if the subsidiary is a unit trust, the greatest
          proportion of the unencumbered value of the land-holdings
          in Queensland that the landholder would be entitled to
          under sections 161A (1), (2) and 161B (1) as ifâ
               (i) a reference to a person were a reference to
               the landholder mentioned in this section; and
               (ii) a reference to a listed unit trust were a
               reference to the subsidiary; or
          (c) if the subsidiary is a trustee of a trust other than a
          unit trustâthe greatest proportion of the unencumbered
          value of the land-holdings in Queensland of the trust that
          the landholder could derive at any time from the trust
          without regard to the liabilities of any of the
          subsidiaries.
     (4) Without limiting subsection (3) (c), land-holdings may be derived
     byâ
          (a) the fulfilment of a condition; or
          (b) the outcome of a contingency; or
          (c) the exercise or non-exercise of a power or discretion.
     (5) If the Queensland land-holdings of a subsidiary of the landholder
     includes land-holdings held for a partnership of which the subsidiary
     is a partner, subsection (2) applies to the unencumbered value of the
     land-holdings held for the partnership regardless of the
     subsidiaryâs interest in the partnership.
     (6) To remove any doubt it is declared that land-holdings may be
     derived by the landholder even if a subsidiary of the landholder is a
     beneficiary of a trust.
     (7) If there is more than 1 subsidiary of the landholder that is a
     beneficiary of a trust, for subsection (2), the proportion of the
     unencumbered value of the Queensland land-holdings that may be
     derived from the trust must not be more than the whole.

          (b) being a shareholder, the personâs share interest
          increases.
     (2) However, the acquisition of a share interest by a beneficiary
     from the personal representative in the administration of the estate
     of a deceased person is not an acquisition for this part.
 
Contracted property and trust interests
*** 213 Contracted property and trust interests ***
     (1) For a corporate trustee, contracted property is taken to be
     dutiable property held by the corporate trustee.

     a trust interest, the corporate trustee is taken to have an indirect
     interest in the trust-related dutiable property.
     (2) For determining the dutiable value of a relevant acquisitionâ
          (a) a sale agreement made by the corporate trustee is taken
          not to have been made; and
          (b) a purchase agreement made by the corporate trustee is
          taken to have been completed.
     (3) Subsection (3A) applies ifâ
          (a) contracted property, or an indirect interest in
          dutiable property mentioned in subsection (1A), is included

          acquisition; and
          (b) the sale agreement for the property or trust interest
          is later completed or the purchase agreement for the
          property or trust interest is later rescinded.

     property or indirect interest were never held by the corporate
     trustee.
     (4) For the reassessment, the acquirer under the relevant acquisition
     must lodge the corporate trustee duty statement for the acquisition.
     (5) In this sectionâ

     "purchase agreement" includes an uncompleted agreement, whether or
     not conditional, for the acquisition of a trust interest through
     which the corporate trustee would have, if the agreement were

     "trust-related dutiable property").

     "sale agreement" includes an uncompleted agreement, whether or not
     conditional, for the sale of a trust interest through which the
     corporate trustee has an indirect interest in dutiable property (also

Apportionmentâhead office or principal place of business in Queensland
*** 218 Apportionmentâhead office or principal place of business in
Queensland ***
     (1) This section applies for determining the unencumbered value of
     dutiable property that is a Queensland business asset, other than a
     debt or personal property, of a Queensland business that has its head
     office or principal place of business in Queensland if, at any time
     during the 3 financial years preceding the relevant acquisition
     concernedâ
          (a) a supply of land, money, credit or goods or any
          interest in them, or provision of services, has been made
          by the business to customers outside Queensland; or
          (b) the asset has been used, exploited or exercised in, or
          relates to, a place outside Queensland.
     (2) A reference in this chapter to the unencumbered value of the
     property is taken to be a reference to the amount (the
     "apportioned amount") worked out using the following formulaâ
     whereâ

     "AA" means the apportioned amount.

     "OS" means the gross amount of the supplies and provision of services
     made by the business to its customers in other States during the 3

     made by the business to all its customers during the 3 completed
     financial years preceding the relevant acquisition.

     "UV" means the unencumbered value of the Queensland business asset
     mentioned in subsection (1).

     the dutiable property on another basis if the commissioner is
     satisfied the other basis would be more appropriate in particular
     circumstances.
 
Apportionmentâhead office or principal place of business in another State
*** 219 Apportionmentâhead office or principal place of business in another
State ***
     (1) This section applies for determining the unencumbered value of
     dutiable property that is a Queensland business asset, other than a
     debt or personal property, of a Queensland business that does not
     have its head office or principal place of business in Queensland if,
     at any time during the 3 financial years preceding the relevant

          relates to, Queensland.
     (2) A reference in this chapter to the unencumbered value of the

     "apportioned amount") worked out using the following formulaâ
     whereâ

     "AA" means the apportioned amount.

     "QS" means the gross amount of the supplies and provision of services
     made by the business to its Queensland customers during the 3
     completed financial years preceding the relevant acquisition.

     "TS" means the gross amount of supplies and provision of services
     made by the business to all its customers during the 3 completed
     financial years preceding the relevant acquisition.

     "UV" means the unencumbered value of the Queensland business asset
     mentioned in subsection (1).
     (3) However, the commissioner may decide the unencumbered value of
     the dutiable property on another basis if the commissioner is

*** 220 Apportionment of particular acquisitions relating to existing rights
***
     (1) This section applies for determining the unencumbered value of
     dutiable property that is an existing right if the right is
     exercisable or relates to the conduct of a business or an activity
     outside Queensland.
     (2) A reference in this chapter to the unencumbered value of the
     right is taken to be a reference to the amount that represents the
     same proportion of the unencumbered value that the unencumbered value
     of the right to the extent it is exercisable or relates to the
     conduct of a business or activity in Queensland bears to the total
     unencumbered value of the right.
     (3) However, the commissioner may decide the unencumbered value of

     basis would be more appropriate in particular circumstances.
 
Acquirerâs share interest is proportionate to shares in corporate trustee or
relevant corporation
*** 221 Acquirerâs share interest is proportionate to shares in corporate
trustee or relevant corporation ***
     (1) For a relevant acquisition that is an acquisition of a share
     interest in a corporate trustee, the acquirerâs share interest is
     the proportion that the number of shares the acquirer has bears to
     the total issued shares in the corporate trustee expressed as a
     percentage.
     (2) For a relevant acquisition that is an acquisition of a share
     interest in a relevant corporation for a corporate trustee if the
     relevant corporation has an interest in the corporate trustee as
     mentioned in section 211 (2) (a), the acquirerâs share interest is
     worked out by applying the acquirerâs share interest in the
     relevant corporation to the relevant corporationâs share interest
     in the corporate trustee.
     (3) For a relevant acquisition that is an acquisition of a share
     interest in a relevant corporation for a corporate trustee if the
     relevant corporation has an interest in the corporate trustee as
     mentioned in section 211 (2) (b), the acquirerâs share interest is
     worked out by applyingâ
          (a) the acquirerâs share interest in the relevant
          corporation to the relevant corporationâs share interest
          in the other relevant corporation; and
          (b) the result worked out under paragraph (a) to the other
          relevant corporationâs share interest in the corporate
          trustee.
     (4) For subsections (2) and (3) â
          (a) the acquirerâs share interest in the relevant
          corporation is the proportion that the number of shares the
          acquirer acquires bears to the total issued shares in the
          relevant corporation expressed as a percentage; and
          (b) the relevant corporationâs share interest in the
          corporate trustee is the proportion that the number of
          shares the relevant corporation holds bears to the total
          issued shares in the corporate trustee expressed as a
          percentage.
     (5) Also, for subsection (3), the relevant corporationâs share
     interest in the other relevant corporation is the proportion that the
     number of shares the relevant corporation holds bears to the total
     issued shares in the other relevant corporation expressed as a
     percentage.
     (6) However, if the commissioner is satisfied the acquirerâs share
     interest worked out under subsection (1), (2) or (3) does not
     accurately represent the acquirerâs rights and obligations as a
     shareholder when compared with the rights and obligations of the
     other shareholders, the commissioner may decide the acquirerâs
     share interest.
     (7) For applying subsection (1), (2) or (3) to a relevant acquisition
     that is an increase in the acquirerâs share interest, the
     acquirerâs share interest is taken to be the increase in the
     acquirerâs share interest.
 
What is the dutiable value of a relevant acquisition
*** 222 What is the dutiable value of a relevant acquisition ***
     (1) The dutiable value of the relevant acquisition is the total of
     the amounts worked out by applying the acquirerâs share interest to
     the unencumbered value, when the liability for corporate trustee duty
     arises, ofâ
          (a) the dutiable property held on trust by the corporate
          trustee; and
          (b) any indirect interest in dutiable property held on
          trust by the corporate trustee.
          Notesâ
                    1 Under section 213 (1), dutiable
                    property includes contracted property.
                    Also, under section 213 (1A), the
                    corporate trustee may be taken to hold
                    an indirect interest in dutiable
                    property through a trust interest that
                    is the subject of a purchase or sale
                    agreement.
                    2 See section 14 (What is the
                    "unencumbered value" of property).
     (2) For subsection (1) (b), the unencumbered value of an indirect
     interest of a corporate trustee under section 210 (a) is the amount
     worked out by applying to the unencumbered value of the dutiable
     property held by the entity in which the corporate trustee has a
     trust interest or partnership interest the corporate trusteeâs
     trust interest or partnership interest in the entity.
     (3) For subsection (1) (b), the unencumbered value of an indirect
     interest of a corporate trustee under section 210 (b) is the amount
     worked out byâ
          (a) first applying to the unencumbered value of the
          dutiable property held by the ultimate entity, the trust
          interest or partnership interest of the trust or
          partnership (the
          "last beneficiary or partner") that is a beneficiary or
          partner of the ultimate entity; and
          (b) applying to the amount worked out under paragraph (a),
          and the unencumbered value of any dutiable property held by
          the last beneficiary or partner, the trust interest or
          partnership interest of the next trust or partnership in
          the series of trusts or partnerships that is a beneficiary
          or partner of the last beneficiary or partner; and
          (c) applying the calculation in paragraph (b) for each of
          the other trusts or partnerships in the series until the
          first entityâs trust interest or partnership interest is
          used in the calculation; and
          (d) applying to the amount last worked out under paragraph
          (c) and the unencumbered value of any dutiable property
          held by the first entity, the trust interest or partnership
          interest of the corporate trustee.
     (4) Schedule 4 contains an example of how the dutiable value of a
     relevant acquisition is worked out.
     (5) If the corporate trustee is trustee of more than 1 discretionary
     trust, the unencumbered value of the dutiable property of each trust
     and each indirect interest held on trust by the corporate trustee
     must be aggregated in working out the dutiable value of the relevant
     acquisition.
 
Aggregation of particular relevant acquisitions
*** 223 Aggregation of particular relevant acquisitions ***
     (1) This section applies for aggregating relevant acquisitions that
     together form, evidence, give effect to or arise from what is,
     substantially 1 arrangement.
     (2) For assessing corporate trustee duty on each of the relevant
     acquisitions, the acquisitions must be aggregated and treated as a
     single relevant acquisition.
     (3) For subsection (1), all relevant circumstances relating to the
     relevant acquisitions must be taken into account in deciding whether
     they together form, evidence, give effect to or arise from what is,
     substantially 1 arrangement.
     (4) For subsection (3), relevant circumstances include the
     followingâ
          (a) whether any of the acquisitions are conditional on

          (e) whether, after the acquisitions take place, the
          acquirersâ interests will be used together or dependently
          with one another;
          (f) whether, before the acquisitions take place, the
          interests were used together or dependently with one
          another.
     (5) Corporate trustee duty imposed on the relevant acquisition
     aggregated under this section mustâ
          (a) be assessed on the total of the dutiable values of the
          acquisitions when the liability for corporate trustee duty
          for each of the acquisitions arose; and
          (b) be apportioned between the acquisitions as decided by
          the commissioner.

          persons of the acquirer included or to be included in the
          arrangement mentioned in subsection (1); and
          (b) the dutiable value of each relevant acquisition.
          Noteâ
               Under the Administration Act, the requirement
               under this subsection is a lodgement requirement
               for which a failure to comply is an offence under

In this partâ

"foreign acquirer" means an acquirer who is a foreign person.

"foreign acquirerâs interest", under a relevant transaction, means the
proportion that the share of the foreign acquirer under the transaction bears
to the total of the shares of all acquirers under the transaction.
     Exampleâ
          Under a relevant transaction that is a relevant acquisition
          on which landholder duty is imposed, person A (a foreign
          acquirer) and person B (not a foreign acquirer) each
          acquire a 45% interest in a public landholder. The
          proportion of person Aâs share under the transaction is
          50% (a 45% interest of a total interest of 90% acquired
          under the transaction). Person Aâs foreign acquirerâs
          interest is therefore 50%.

          relevant transaction; and
          (b) a reference to the acquirer, in relation to a relevant
          transaction, is a reference to the acquirer under the
          relevant transaction.
     (2) Also, a reference in this part to land used for an eligible BTR
     development at a particular time, rather than for a financial year,
     is a reference to land to which both of the following applyâ
          (a) the land is land used for an eligible BTR development
          for the financial year during which the particular time

          (b) during the period starting at midnight on 30 June
          immediately preceding the particular time and ending at the
          particular time, nothing has happened that would prevent
          the land being land used for an eligible BTR development
          for the financial year starting on the next 1 July.
               Examples of matters that would prevent the land
               being land used for an eligible BTR development
               for the financial year starting on the next 1
               Julyâ

                         that are discounted rent
                         dwellings within the meaning
                         of the Land Tax Act 2010 is
                         less than 10% for more than
                         30 days.
                         2 During the period mentioned
                         in paragraph (b), the
                         dwellings in the eligible BTR
                         development cease to be
                         managed in compliance with

          part of the property.
     (4) The relevant section applies to the later disposal as if the
     relevant acquirer had not transferred the part of the land to the
     acquirerâs spouse.

     (4) If the commissioner is required, because of an order of a court
     or tribunal, to repay an amount to a person for an amount paid in
     relation to invalid AFAD, the commissioner is taken to have complied
     with the order if the commissioner applies the amount under
     subsection (3).
     (5) To remove any doubt, it is declared that this section does not
     affect the operation of the Administration Act, section 42 in

     (4) For reassessing the windfall dutyâ
          (a) chapter 4 applies for working out the amount of the
          invalid AFAD as if it were validly imposed AFAD; and
          (b) the Administration Act, part 5 applies for working out
          unpaid tax interest and penalty tax in relation to the
          amount of the invalid AFAD as if it were validly imposed
          AFAD.

     (c) the start date for the Administration Act, section 54 (2) and (3)
     isâ

          relation to the purported liability for the invalid AFAD
          and, when the last payment was made, late payment interest

          separately from an assessment of AFAD under chapter 4 for
          the same transaction, whether or not the assessments are
          the subject of the same assessment notice; and
          (b) the purported imposition of the invalid AFAD does not
          affectâ
               (i) the validity of an assessment of any other
               duty for the transaction; or
               (ii) any other right or liability acquired or
               incurred, or an act or omission done or made, in
               relation to the assessment of other duty for the
               transaction.

          once for an advance.
 
Mortgage over property not wholly in Queensland
*** 260 Mortgage over property not wholly in Queensland ***
     (1) Mortgage duty must be assessed for a mortgage over property that
     is partly in and partly outside Queensland as if the amount secured
     by it were only the dutiable proportion.
     (2) For subsection (1), the dutiable proportion is the proportion of
     the amount secured by the mortgage on which mortgage duty is imposed
     that, at the liability date, the value of property in Queensland
     affected by the mortgage bears to the value of all property affected
     by it, other than property located outside Australia or in a
     Territory or in Victoria or Tasmania.
     (3) The dutiable proportion must be worked out by reference to the
     property values according to a referable point.
     (4) For subsection (3), a referable point is any of the following
     prepared in the year before the liability date for the mortgageâ
          (a) an independent valuation of the secured property;
          (b) a statement of the mortgagee based on information
          obtained by the mortgagee in deciding to make the advance
          to the mortgagor;
          (c) property valuations used by the mortgagor in preparing
          an annual return to be lodged under the Corporations Act;

          corporationâs financial position;
          (e) agreed property valuations that form the basis of the
          mortgagorâs insurance policies;
          (f) another document the commissioner considers to be
          appropriate for working out the dutiable proportion.
     (5) However, if there is more than 1 referable point for a mortgage,
     the referable point is the later or latest of the referable points.
     (6) Also, the acceptable referable point must be the same acceptable
     referable point used to determine liability to duty under a
     corresponding Act.
 
Advances secured by mortgage package
*** 261 Advances secured by mortgage package ***
     (1) Ifâ

          secure or partly secure the same amount; and
          (b) at least 1 of the instruments is a security affecting
          property wholly or partly outside Queensland; and
          (c) at least 1 of the instruments is a mortgage;
     the instruments are a
     "mortgage package".
     (2) Also, a
     "mortgage package" includesâ
          (a) a mortgage signed after the liability date if the
          commissioner is satisfied the mortgage was intended to be
          part of the package; and
          (b) a mortgage previously collateral to an earlier advance
          under 1 or more of the other mortgages in the package.
     (3) Mortgage duty must be assessed under this part on the mortgage
     package as if the instruments comprising the mortgage package were 1
     mortgage, first signed on the day the last of the signed instruments
     was signed.
     (4) One of the mortgages in the mortgage package must be stamped with
     the mortgage duty paid in Queensland for the mortgage package and all
     other mortgages in the mortgage package must be stamped as a
     collateral mortgage.
 
Collateral mortgage
*** 262 Collateral mortgage ***
     (1) Mortgage duty is not imposed on the part of the amount secured by
     a collateral mortgage that is secured byâ
          (a) a mortgage or security instrument that is properly
          stamped under this Act or a corresponding Act; or
          (b) a mortgage package that has been properly stamped under
          section 261 or a corresponding Act.
     (1A) However, a mortgage (a
     "secondary mortgage") that secures all or part of the same amount as
     another mortgage, security instrument or mortgage package that
     affects property located in Victoria or Tasmania and has been
     properly stamped under this Act or a corresponding Act is taken not
     to be a collateral mortgage if the commissioner is satisfied there
     was an arrangement to avoid the imposition of mortgage duty on the
     secondary mortgage.
     (2) A collateral mortgage that no longer secures an amount secured by
     a mortgage, instrument or mortgage package mentioned in subsection
     (1) is not security for another advance unless mortgage duty for the
     amount of the other advance is paid.
 
Extent mortgage is enforceable
*** 263 Extent mortgage is enforceable ***
     (1) A mortgage or mortgage package for which mortgage duty is imposed
     or a similar duty is chargeable under a corresponding Act is
     enforceable only to the extent of the amount secured by the mortgage
     or mortgage package for which duty has been paid, or the mortgage or
     mortgage package is exempt from duty, under this Act or the
     corresponding Act.
     (2) For subsection (1), mortgage duty has been paid on a mortgage or
     mortgage package affecting property that is partly in and partly
     outside Queensland ifâ
          (a) duty has been paid on the total advances under the
          mortgage or mortgage package when the mortgage duty paid is
          taken with the duty paid under a corresponding Act; and
          (b) the dutiable proportion of the mortgage or mortgage
          package is not incorrect by more than 5%.
          Noteâ
               Under section 260 (3), the dutiable proportion
               must be worked out by reference to property
               values according to a referable point.
     (3) For subsection (1), if an advance is made on or after 1 July 2004
     under a mortgage or mortgage package that, before 1 July 2004,
     affected property located in Victoria and was properly stamped under
     the Duties Act 2000 (Vic), the mortgage or mortgage package is taken
     to be a mortgage or mortgage package for which a similar duty is
     chargeable under a corresponding Act.
     (4) For subsection (1), if an advance is made on or after 1 July 2007
     under a mortgage or mortgage package that, before 1 July 2007,
     affected property located in Tasmania and was properly stamped under
     the Duties Act 2001 (Tas), the mortgage or mortgage package is taken
     to be a mortgage or mortgage package for which a similar duty is
     chargeable under a corresponding Act.
 
Limit on security provided by stamped and collateral mortgages
*** 264 Limit on security provided by stamped and collateral mortgages ***
     (1) A stamped or collateral mortgage that was, but is no longer, part
     of the same mortgage package and no longer secures the same amount
     secured by the package is not security for another advance unless
     mortgage duty for the amount of the other advance is paid.
          Example for subsection (1)â
               A has property in 5 States, each valued at
               $150,000. A borrows $100,000 secured by a
               mortgage package comprising 5 mortgages. The
               mortgages secure the full $100,000 and are
               stamped under this Act and the corresponding Acts
               of the other States on the basis that the
               dutiable proportion for each mortgage is $20,000.
               Under a restructure of the loans, the Queensland
               mortgage no longer secures the $100,000 which
               remains secured by the other mortgages on which
               duty has been paid in the other States.
               Under this subsection, if A takes out a new loan,
               the Queensland mortgage is not security for the
               new loan unless mortgage duty imposed on it is
               paid.
     (2) The fact that the stamped or collateral mortgage is no longer
     part of the mortgage package does not affect the amounts for which
     the remaining mortgages in the mortgage package provide security.
 
Multi-jurisdictional statement
*** 265 Multi-jurisdictional statement ***
     (1) If mortgage duty is imposed on the dutiable proportion of a
     mortgage, (whether for a mortgage over property not wholly in
     Queensland, a mortgage package or on original or subsequent
     advances), the mortgagor or mortgagee must make a statement in the
     approved form about the location and value of the secured property.
          Penalty--
               Maximum penaltyâ40 penalty units.
     (2) The making of a statement under subsection (1) by the mortgagor
     or mortgagee relieves the other person from complying with the
     subsection.
     (3) The statement may be taken to be the mortgage, or mortgages
     comprising the mortgage package.

          by the corporation.
     (2) Mortgage duty must be assessed on the mortgage for the offer of
     debentures as if it were a mortgage securing the payment of an amount
     equal to the total amount of debentures, other than exempt short-term
     debentures, subscribed for by the public in Queensland from time to
     time.
     (3) On or before 31 July in each year, the trustee under the

          (b) pay to the commissioner mortgage duty on the amount
          subscribed for in the year for the debentures, other than
          exempt short-term debentures.
     (4) If mortgage duty is paid under subsection (3), the instrument of
     trust and debentures are not liable to duty under this Act.
     (5) In this section, a reference to an amount subscribed for relating
     to debentures does not include an amount represented by debentures
     issued on the conversion or renewal of an existing holding of
     debentures or other marketable securities.
 
What is an exempt short-term debenture

          within a fixed or certain period but the amount is later
          paid or repaid within 6 months after it is issued; and
          (b) the debenture is not part of an arrangement, the effect
          of which is to extend the period for repayment of an amount
          to more than 6 months after it is issued.
     (2) If a debenture is reissued or renewed, the combined terms of
     debentures is taken into account when deciding when the amount under
     the debenture is repayable for subsection (1).
     (3) Also, for subsection (1), debentures subscribed for by a
     corporation include debentures subscribed for by a related body
     corporate unless the commissioner decides otherwise.

     regulation.
     (3) However, the commissioner may, on the written application of an
     insurer or an insured person, apportion a premium or part of a
     premium on another basis if the commissioner is satisfied the
     apportionment on that basis would result in less insurance duty being
     paid.
 
Apportionment between different types or classes of insurance
*** 367 Apportionment between different types or classes of insurance ***
If the commissioner is not satisfied a premium paid for a contract of insurance
effecting different types or classes of insurance has been properly apportioned

               (ii) separate insurers between whom there is an
               arrangement about the insurance; and
          (b) 1 or more of the premiums under the primary
          contractsâ
               (i) are conditional on 1 or more other contracts
               of insurance (the
               "secondary contracts") being effected; or
               (ii) are part of an arrangement that applies only
               if 1 or more other contracts of insurance (also
               the
               "secondary contracts") are effected; and
          (c) 1 or more of the premiums under the primary contracts
          attract insurance duty at a different rate to 1 or more of
          the premiums under the secondary contracts; and
          (d) the commissioner is not satisfied a premium for 1 of
          the contracts reflects the relative risk of the contract.
     (2) The commissioner may apportion part of the total premiums payable
     to each of the contracts of insurance as the commissioner considers
     appropriate.

          (a) the application to register or transfer the vehicle is
          made in relation to a dutiable transaction; and

          the market value or part of the market value of the
          vehicle; and
          (c) transfer duty in schedule 3 has been paid or is payable
          on the dutiable transaction.
     (2) The reduction must be worked out using the following formulaâ
     whereâ

     was worked out by applying the rate of transfer duty under schedule
     3.

     worked out.

     "MVV" means the market value of the vehicle or part of the market
     value of the vehicle mentioned in subsection (1) (b).

     "R" means the amount of the reduction.
          Example for subsection (2)â
               A dutiable transaction comprises the transfer of
               the following dutiable property for the
               consideration statedâ
                    â¢ a statutory business licence
                    ($5,000)
                    â¢ personal property ($15,000)
                    including a vehicle ($10,000).
               Assuming the consideration for the transaction is
               the dutiable value, transfer duty of $225 is
               imposed on the transaction under chapter 2, being
               the amount worked out at the applicable rate of
               duty stated in schedule 3.
               In working out the reductionâ
                    â¢ factor DP is $225, being transfer
                    duty on the transaction
                    â¢ factor MVV is $10,000, being the
                    market value of the vehicle
                    â¢ factor DVDP is $20,000, being the
                    dutiable value of the transaction on
                    which transfer duty is imposed at the
                    applicable rate of duty stated in
                    schedule 3.
               Applying the formula, the reduction is $112.50.
     (3) However, the reduction must not be more than the amount of
     vehicle registration duty that is otherwise payable under section 382
     (2).

               of tax), division 3 (Reassessments).
     (4) However, subsection (2) does not applyâ
          (a) if the transferor or transferee ceases to exist, other
          than under an arrangement, a significant purpose of which

          transferee belong to the same corporate group for the 3
          years mentioned in subsection (1); or
          (b) ifâ
               (i) the transferor or transferee ceases to be a

               are offered and sold to the public; and

     (c) if less than 5% of the value of the property held, directly or
     indirectly, by the company that ceases to be a group company is
     dutiable property.
     (5) Without limiting subsection (4) (a), a company registered under
     the Corporations Act ceases to exist if it is deregistered under that
     Act.

     contrived schemes to reduce liability to duty.
     (2) Subject to subsection (1), nothing in this Act limits the
     operation of this chapter.
 
Application of ch 11
*** 433 Application of ch 11 ***
     (1) This chapter applies ifâ
          (a) an entity (the
          "avoider") has obtained, or would apart from this chapter
          obtain, a duty benefit from a scheme started to be carried
          out after the commencement of this chapter; and
          (b) taking into account the matters mentioned in section
          435, it is reasonable to conclude that an entity, whether
          alone or with others, that entered into or carried out the
          scheme, or part of the scheme, did so for the sole or
          dominant purpose of enabling the entity or another entity
          to obtain a duty benefit from the scheme.
     (2) It does not matterâ
          (a) whether the scheme, or any part of the scheme is
          entered into or carried out inside or outside Queensland;
          or
          (b) whether or not the duty benefit the entity obtained is
          the same kind of duty benefit mentioned in subsection (1)
          (a).
     (3) However, despite subsection (1), this chapter does not apply in
     relation to a duty benefit that is attributable to an exemption or
     concession under this Act for duty, unless an entity entered into or
     carried out a scheme or part of a scheme for the sole or dominant
     purpose of creating a circumstance or state of affairs to which the
     exemption or concession would apply.
     (4) For this section, for deciding what was an entityâs sole or
     dominant purpose for entering into or carrying out a scheme or part
     of a scheme, any purpose relating to eliminating, reducing or
     postponing a liability for a foreign tax is to be disregarded.

     be, less than it would have been apart from the scheme or a part of
     the scheme.
     (2) The amount of the duty benefit is the difference between the
     amount of duty payable and the amount of duty that would have been
     payable apart from the scheme or part of the scheme.

          has, or has had, any connection, whether of a business,
          family or other nature, with the avoider, being a change
          that has resulted, will result, or may reasonably be
          expected to result from the scheme;

          mentioned in paragraph (g) of the scheme having been
          entered into or carried out;

          family or other nature, between the avoider and any person
          mentioned in paragraph (g);

     benefit.

     or the repealed Act;
     (b) the self assessor or a representative of the self assessor has
     contravened a provision of this Act or the repealed Act (being a
     provision a contravention of which is not an offence against this
     Act, the Administration Act or the repealed Act);
     (c) the self assessor was registered because of a materially false or
     misleading representation or declaration;
     (d) the self assessor has been given a notice under section 488 (2)
     and has failed to payâ
          (i) the penalty amount by the date for payment stated in
          the notice; or
          (ii) if the commissioner enters into an arrangement for
          payment of the penalty amount by instalments under section

     has failed to give notice to the commissioner as required under
     section 470 (3);
     (f) each of the following appliesâ
          (i) the self assessor has endorsed an ELN transaction
          document on the basis that section 22 (2A) applies to the
          ELN transfer;
          (ii) the ELN transaction document is registered under the
          Land Title Act 1994;
          (iii) the commitment amount for the payment commitment made
          for the relevant transfer agreement was not paid to the
          commissioner in full as required;
     (g) the commissioner reasonably believes that, having regard to the
     self assessorâs conduct, the self assessorâs registration poses
     an unacceptable risk that the self assessor will not comply with an
     obligation under this Act or the Administration Act.
 
Show cause notice
*** 466 Show cause notice ***
     (1) If the commissioner believes a ground exists to suspend or cancel
     a self assessorâs registration, the commissioner may give the self
     assessor a notice under this section (a
     "show cause notice").
     (2) The show cause notice must state the followingâ
          (a) the commissioner proposes to suspend or cancel the self
          assessorâs registration (the
          "proposed action");
          (b) the grounds for the proposed action;
          (c) an outline of the facts and circumstances forming the
          basis for the grounds;
          (d) if the proposed action is suspension of
          registrationâthe proposed suspension period;
          (e) an invitation to the self assessor to show within a
          stated period (the
          "show cause period") why the proposed action should not be
          taken.
     (3) The show cause period must be a period ending at least 21 days
     after the show cause notice is given to the self assessor.

     "accepted representations") made under subsection (1).
 
Ending show cause process without further action
*** 468 Ending show cause process without further action ***
     (1) This section applies if, after considering the accepted
     representations for the show cause notice, the commissioner no longer
     believes a ground exists to suspend or cancel the self assessorâs
     registration.
     (1A) Also, this section applies ifâ
          (a) the ground mentioned in section 465 (f) is the only
          ground for the proposed action stated in the show cause
          notice; and
          (b) after considering the accepted representations for the
          show cause notice, the commissioner is reasonably satisfied
          the reason the commitment amount was not paid to the
          commissioner in full as required was beyond the self
          assessorâs control.
          Example for subsection (1A)â
               The commitment amount was not paid because an ELN
               system occurrence prevented the ELN distributing
               funds for duty, assessed interest or penalty tax.
     (2) The commissioner must not take any further action about the show
     cause notice.
     (3) Notice that no further action is to be taken about the show cause
     notice must be given to the self assessor by the commissioner.

     (3) For subsection (2), a return for a self assessment does not
     include another document that is, under a provision of this Act,
     taken to be a return for a self assessment.

          transaction to which a relevant lodgement requirement for
          the instrument or transaction would apply if section 471D
          did not apply; and
          (b) for a return self assessmentâpay to the self assessor

          days after the date liability for duty for the instrument
          or transaction arises.
     (3) The liable party complies with subsection (1) (a) only ifâ
          (a) all instruments or documents required to be given to
          the self assessor under the subsection have been given as
          required under section 471F; and

Imposition of AFAD payable 1 January 2018 to 8 April 2024
*** 688 Imposition of AFAD payable 1 January 2018 to 8 April 2024 ***
     (1) This section applies ifâ
          (a) AFAD was purportedly imposed on a relevant transaction
          under chapter 4; and
          (b) the AFAD was purportedly payable on or after 1 January
          2018 and before 8 April 2024; and
          (c) the purported imposition of AFAD on the relevant
          transaction was invalid only because the provisions of this
          Act that purportedly imposed the AFAD were to any extent
          invalid or inoperative under the Commonwealth Constitution,
          section 109 because of an inconsistency with a provision of
          an agreement given the force of law by the International
          Tax Agreements Act 1953 (Cwlth), section 5 (1).
     (2) AFAD is imposed on the relevant transaction.
     (3) The liability for AFAD imposed under subsection (2) is taken to
     have arisen, and to have always arisen, at the same time as liability
     for the purported duty would have arisen if the purported duty had
     been validly imposed.
     (4) AFAD imposed under subsection (2) is payable by, and is taken to
     have always been payable by, the person who would have been liable
     for the purported duty if the purported duty had been validly
     imposed.
     (5) The amount of AFAD payable under subsection (2) is the same
     amount, and is taken to have always been the same amount, as the
     amount of AFAD that would have been payable if the purported duty had
     been validly imposed.
     (6) The rights and liabilities of a person in relation to AFAD
     imposed under subsection (2) are taken to be, and to have always
     been, the same as the rights and liabilities that the person would
     have had in relation to the purported duty if the purported duty had
     been validly imposed.
     (7) Anything done or omitted to be done by a person in relation to
     the purported duty has, and is taken to have always had, the same
     force and effect as if it were done or omitted to be done in relation
     to AFAD imposed under subsection (2).
     (8) In this sectionâ

     "purported duty", in relation to a relevant transaction, means AFAD
     referred to in subsection (1) that was purportedly imposed on the
     relevant transaction.

     "relevant transactions" see section 230.

*** SCHEDULE 4 - Example for partnership and trust acquisitions and relevant
acquisitions for corporate trustees ***
This example shows how the value of a partnership acquisition or trust
acquisition or dutiable value of a relevant acquisition under chapter 3, part
2, is worked out in the following circumstancesâ
     (a) a person acquires a 20% interest inâ
          (i) for a partnership acquisitionâa relevant partnership
          under section 46; or
          (ii) for a trust acquisitionâa relevant trust under
          section 63; or
          (iii) for a relevant acquisition under chapter 3, part 2
          âa corporate trustee;
     (b) the relevant partnership, relevant trust or corporate trustee
     holds dutiable property the unencumbered value of which is $100,000
     and has a 50% partnership interest in partnership AB;
     (c) partnership AB holds dutiable property the unencumbered value of
     which is $100,000 and has a 50% partnership interest in partnership
     BC;
     (d) partnership BC has a 50% partnership interest in partnership CD;
     (e) partnership CD holds dutiable property the unencumbered value of
     which is $500,000 and is the sole beneficiary in trust E;
     (f) trust E holds dutiable property the unencumbered value of which
     is $1,000,000.
In this exampleâ
     (a) trust E is the ultimate entity because it holds dutiable property
     and there is no other partnership or trust lower in the series
     holding dutiable property; and
     (b) under section 46 (3) (a), 63 (4) (a) or 222 (3) (a), partnership
     CD is the last beneficiary.
The value of the partnership acquisition or trust acquisition or dutiable value
of the relevant acquisition is worked out as followsâ
Step 1
Partnership CDs trust interest in trust E (100%) is applied to the unencumbered
value of the dutiable property held by the trust ($1,000,000).
The result is $1,000,000.
Step 2
Partnership BCs partnership interest in partnership CD (50%) is applied toâ
     (a) the result under step 1 ($1,000,000); and
     (b) the unencumbered value of the dutiable property held by the
     partnership ($500,000).
The result is $750,000.
Step 3
Partnership ABs partnership interest in partnership BC (50%) is applied to the
amount worked out under step 2 ($750,000).
The result is $375,000.
Step 4
The partnership interest of the relevant partnership, relevant trust or
corporate trustee in partnership AB (50%) is applied toâ
     (a) the result under step 3 ($375,000); and
     (b) the unencumbered value of the dutiable property held by the
     partnership ($100,000).
The result is $237,500.
Step 5
The acquirerâs interest (20%) is applied toâ
     (a) the result under step 4 ($237,500); and
     (b) the unencumbered value of the dutiable property held by the
     relevant partnership, relevant trust or corporate trustee ($100,000).
The value of the partnership acquisition or trust acquisition or dutiable value
of the relevant acquisition is $67,500.
