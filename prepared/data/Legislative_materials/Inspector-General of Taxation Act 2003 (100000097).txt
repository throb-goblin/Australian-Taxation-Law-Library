 (4) For the purposes of the Ombudsman Act 1976 (other than subsection 6D(2), (3) or (4) of that Act), a complaint (or part of a complaint) transferred under this section is taken to be a complaint made to the Ombudsman under that Act.
Note: A similar provision for transferring to the Inspector-General complaints made to the Ombudsman is contained in section  6D of the Ombudsman Act 1976. Subsection 6D(6) of that Act deems transferred complaints to be complaints made to the Inspector -General under this Act.

Misdescribed amendments
