was made with a collateral\n     purpose of reducing the duty otherwise chargeable under this Chapter.\n     (3) In this Chapter--\n     \"beneficial ownership\" includes ownership of dutiable

gift, allotment or issue of a unit in a\n          unit trust scheme,\n          (b) the cancellation, redemption or surrender of a unit in\n          a unit trust scheme,\n          (c) the abrogation or alteration of a right relating to a\n          unit in a unit trust scheme,\n          (d) the payment of an account owing for a unit in a unit\n          trust scheme,\n          (e)

(l) a combination of the transactions referred to in\n          paragraphs (a)-(k).\n     \"lease\" means a lease of land in New South Wales or an agreement for\n     a lease of land in New South Wales.\n     \"premium\", in respect of a lease entered into pursuant to an option,\n     includes an amount paid or payable for the grant of the option.\n     \"transfer\" includes an assignment, an exchange and a buy-back of\n     shares in accordance with Division 2 of Part 2J.1 of the Corporations\n     Act 2001 of the Commonwealth."

The partnership has liabilities of $6 million. One\n          partner retires, and is paid $2 million for his or her\n          partnership interest. The retiring partner transfers a one-\n          third interest in the land to the remaining partners. Duty\n          is payable at an ad valorem rate on the transfer of the\n          one-third interest in the land. The transfer of the\n          interest in land has a dutiable value of $3 million. Under\n          this section, the partnership interest has a dutiable value\n          of $1.5 million (DV = $2M × $9M/$12M). As the dutiable\n          value of the interest in land transferred exceeds the\n          dutiable value of the partnership interest transferred, the\n          minimum duty would be payable on the transfer of the\n          partnership interest.\n     (3A) The minimum duty chargeable in respect of a transfer of a\n     partnership interest to which subsection (3) applies is $100.\n     (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), each of the following items\n     of dutiable property is a\n     \"land-related asset\" --\n          (a) land in New South Wales,\n          (b) transferable floor space,\n          (c) a land use entitlement,\n          (d) an interest in an item of dutiable property referred to\n          in paragraph (a), (b) or (c)."

The\n     duty chargeable on that assignment is referred to in this Part as\n     \"call option assignment duty\".\n     (1A) Duty under Chapter 2A is also chargeable on the assignment if A\n     is a foreign person and the dutiable property concerned is\n     residential-related property. The duty chargeable on that assignment\n     is additional to call option assignment duty and is referred to in\n     this Part as\n     \"surcharge call option assignment duty\".\n     (2) For the purposes of this section--\n          (a) if A enters into an agreement or arrangement under\n          which A, for valuable consideration, relinquishes the right\n          under a call option to require B to sell dutiable property\n          and a call option to require B to sell the dutiable\n          property is granted to a third person (\n          \"C\"), A is to be treated as having assigned that right\n          under the call option so that the option is exercisable by\n          C, and\n          (b) if, on or in connection with the exercise of a call\n          option, A, for valuable consideration, enters into an\n          agreement or arrangement under which A nominates a third\n          person (\n          \"C\") as the purchaser or transferee of dutiable property\n          the subject of a call option, A is to be treated as having\n          assigned the right under the call option to require B to\n          sell the dutiable property so that the option is\n          exercisable by C, and\n          (c) if A enters into an agreement or arrangement under\n          which A, for valuable consideration, relinquishes the right\n          under a call option to require B to sell dutiable property\n          and B agrees to sell the dutiable property to a third\n          person (\n          \"C\"), A is to be treated as having assigned that right\n          under the call option so that the option is exercisable by\n          C.\n     (3) An assignment is chargeable with duty as a consequence of this\n     Part only if the person who may be required under the call option to\n     sell the dutiable property (that is, B) has a right under a put\n     option to require A, an associated person of A or an assignee of A to\n     purchase the dutiable property.\n     (4) If the assignment is chargeable with call option assignment duty,\n     Chapter 2 applies in respect of the assignment in the same way as it\n     applies to other transfers of dutiable property, and a reference in\n     this Act to a dutiable transaction includes such an assignment,\n     subject to this Part.\n     (4A) If the assignment is chargeable with surcharge call option\n     assignment duty, Chapter 2A applies in respect of the assignment in\n     the same way as it applies to other transfers of residential-related\n     property, and a reference in this Act to a surcharge duty transaction\n     includes such an assignment, subject to this Part.\n     (5) For the purposes of Chapters 2 and 2A, the transfer of dutiable\n     property (including dutiable property that is residential-related\n     property) is taken to occur when the assignment is made.\n     (6) This section applies regardless of when the call option or put\n     option is exercisable.\n     (7) An assignment of a right under a call option to purchase dutiable\n     property, as referred to in subsection (1) or (2), is referred to in\n     this Part as a\n     \"call option assignment\"."

      "text": "(1) In this section-- \"land used for aquaculture\" means land subject to an aquaculture permit (within the meaning of the Fisheries Management Act 1994). \"refinancing mortgage\" means a mortgage that-- (a) secures the amount of the balance outstanding under an earlier mortgage that is discharged or to be discharged as part of the arrangements for the new mortgage, and (b) is created to secure an advance to the same borrower as under the earlier mortgage, and (c) is over the same or substantially the same property or part of the property as the earlier mortgage. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), mortgages are created to secure an advance to the same borrower if, either directly by the mortgages themselves or indirectly through one or more collateral arrangements, the same person obtains the advances secured by them. (3) A refinancing mortgage is taken to have been stamped with ad valorem duty as a mortgage in respect of the duty-free refinancing amount, except as provided by subsection (5). (3A) For the purposes of this section, the \"duty-free refinancing amount\" is the lesser of the following amounts-- (a) the amount secured by the earlier mortgage on which duty has been paid under this Act or in relation to which an exemption from duty has been obtained, (b) $1,000,000. (3B) However, if the refinancing mortgage is over land used for primary production or land used for aquaculture, the \"duty-free refinancing amount\" is the maximum amount payable under or secured by the earlier mortgage (being an amount in relation to which mortgage duty has been paid or in relation to which an exemption from duty has been obtained). Note : \"Land used for primary production\" is defined in the Dictionary. (4) If an advance is refinanced by more than one lender, so that mortgages given to the lenders together secure the balance outstanding under an earlier mortgage, the definition of \"refinancing mortgage\" in subsection (1) is to be construed as though-- (a) the reference to a mortgage securing the outstanding balance were a reference to the aggregate of such mortgages, and (b) the reference to property were a reference to the property securing the aggregate of refinancing advances made by the lenders under their combined mortgages, to the intent that, if the requirements of the definition, as so construed, are satisfied, each lender is taken, for the purposes of this section, to be the holder of a refinancing mortgage. (5) If, as provided by subsection (4), each of a number of lenders is the holder of a refinancing mortgage, a refinancing mortgage held by each lender is taken to have been duly stamped with ad valorem duty as a mortgage in respect of an amount equal to the same proportion of the duty-free refinancing amount as the amount secured by that mortgage bears to the total amount secured by the refinancing mortgages held by all the lenders. (6) If each of two or more refinancing mortgages severally secures the same advance-- (a) the provisions of subsection (3) or (5), as the case may be, apply to such one of the mortgages as the Chief Commissioner determines, and (b) no duty is chargeable in respect of any of the others. (8) Duty at the rate of $4 per $1,000 or remaining part of $1,000 is payable on the amount by which the advance made under a refinancing mortgage (not being a mortgage on which, by virtue of subsection (6) (b), no duty is chargeable) exceeds-- (a) the duty-free refinancing amount, or (b) the proportion of that amount referred to in subsection (5), in the case of a refinancing to which subsection (4) applies. (8A) If a borrower is a related body corporate of a borrower under an earlier mortgage, the firstmentioned borrower is taken to be the same borrower or the same person for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2). (9) If a borrower under an earlier mortgage dies, or is a party to a marriage that has been dissolved or annulled or, in the opinion of the Chief Commissioner, has broken down irretrievably or is party to a de facto relationship that, in the opinion of the Chief Commissioner, has been terminated, the remaining borrower is, or the remaining borrowers are, taken to be the same borrower or the same person for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2). (10) A party to a marriage or de facto relationship may provide a statement to the Chief Commissioner, in the form of a statutory declaration, to the effect that-- (a) in the case of a marriage-- (i) the party intends to apply"
