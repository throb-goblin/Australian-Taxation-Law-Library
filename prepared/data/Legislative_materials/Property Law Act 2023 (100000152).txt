          (b) the seller of a lot gives the buyer of the lot a
          disclosure statement for, or prescribed certificate

          (a) the sellerâs failure to give the disclosure statement
          or prescribed certificate, or the giving of the inaccurate
          or incomplete statement or certificate, is also a failure
          to comply with another Act; and

          the failure, or for the giving of the inaccurate or

     (5) For subsection (4) (b), the other Act is taken not to provide a
     consequence to the seller for the failure, or for the giving of the
     inaccurate or incomplete statement or certificate, only because the

     certificate, is an offence under that Act.

     mortgage into court, the registrar of the court must give the person
     a certificate stating thatâ
          (a) an order has been made under subsection (2); and
          (b) no amount remains payable under the mortgage.
     (4) The certificate operates to discharge the mortgage debt.
     (5) However, as between the mortgagor and another person entitled to
     the mortgage debt, any amount shown by the other person entitled to
     the mortgage debt to have been in fact due or payable over the amount
     determined by the court under subsection (2) (a), or paid into court
     under subsection (2) (b), continues to be a debt due under the

     (6) If an amount is paid into court under subsection (2) (b), the
     court must, on the application of the person entitled to the amount,
     order the amount to be paid to that person.

          capable of registration under the Land Act 1994, section
          342 as a release of mortgage; and
          (b) for a mortgage registered under the Land Title Act 1994
          âis capable of registration under the Land Title Act
          1994, section 81 as an instrument releasing the mortgage;
          and
          (c) for a mortgage under a Resource Act or another
          Actâhas effect under that Act as a document signed by the
          mortgagee to the effect that the debt secured by the

     (9) For the purpose of effecting registration under subsection (8)
     (b), the registrar may dispense with the publication of any notice or

*** 180 Power of court to impose statutory right of use ***
     (1) A person having an interest in land (the
     "benefited land") may apply to the court for an order imposing a
     statutory right of use over other land (the
     "burdened land") if the statutory right of use is reasonably
     necessary for the effective use and development of the benefited
     land.
     (2) Also, a person having an interest in land (also the
     "benefited land") may apply to the court for an order imposing a
     statutory right of use over other land (the
     "burdened land"), relating to a utility, in favour of the public
     utility provider providing the utility, if the statutory right of use
     is reasonably necessary for the effective use and development of the
     benefited land.
     (3) A statutory right of use imposed under subsection (1) may take
     any form, including, for example an easement or licence.
     (4) A statutory right of use imposed under subsection (2) must take
     the form of an easement in gross.
     (5) The court may make the order if the court is satisfied thatâ
          (a) the statutory right of use is reasonably necessary for
          the effective use and development of the benefited land;
          and
          (b) the statutory right of use is consistent with the
          operation of the Planning Act 2016, including, for example,

          (e) the person applying to the court has made reasonable
          attempts to obtain the easement, or other statutory right
          of use, by agreement; and
          (f) the attempts mentioned in paragraph (e) have been
          unsuccessful becauseâ
               (i) a person has refused to agree to the
               statutory right of use and the refusal is
               unreasonable in all the circumstances; or
               (ii) a person who has capacity to agree to the
               statutory right of use can not be located.
     (6) Also, for a statutory right of use imposed under subsection (2),
     the court may make the order only if the court is satisfiedâ
          (a) the statutory right of use is able to be registered;
          and
          (b) the public utility provider has agreed to the terms of
          the statutory right of use; and
          (c) the local government in whose area the statutory right
          of use is located has agreed to the terms of the statutory
          right of use.
     (7) If the court makes the order, the court must state in the
     orderâ

          terms; and
          (b) the land to be benefited, and the land to be burdened,
          by the statutory right of use.
     (8) However, for subsection (7) (b), the court is not required to
     state the land to be benefited if the statutory right of use is
     imposed under subsection (2).
     (9) Also, if the court makes the order, and is satisfied that a
     person having an interest in the burdened land will suffer loss or
     disadvantage arising from the imposition of the statutory right of
     use, the court must make an order that the applicant pay an amount to
     the person, considered by the court to be just in the circumstances,
     by way of compensation.

          use, to be prepared;

          (a) the interest must be registered; and
          (b) unless otherwise ordered by the court, the applicant
          must register the interest.
     (12) If an interest is registered under subsection (11), the order
     creating the interest binds all persons, including, for example, the
     parties to the proceeding and each of their successors in title.
     (13) The costs of a proceeding under this section are payable by the
     applicant unless special circumstances exist.
     (14) Despite section 3, this section does not bind the State, other
     than to the extent a public utility provider is bound to comply with
     a statutory right of use in the form of an easement in gross in
     favour of the public utility provider.
     (15) In this sectionâ
     "public utility provider" means a public utility provider under the

          "benefited land"); or
          (b) an easement in gross.
     (2) A person having an interest in the burdened land may apply to the
     court for an order modifying or extinguishing the easement or
     covenant.
     (3) The court may make the order if the court is satisfiedâ
          (a) the easement or covenant is obsolete because ofâ
               (i) a change in the use of the benefited land; or
               (ii) a change in the character of the area in the
               vicinity of the benefited land; or
               (iii) other circumstances the court considers
               material; or
          (b) the continued existence of the easement or covenantâ
               (i) would impede a reasonable use of the burdened
               land; or
               (ii) would not provide a practical benefit of
               substantial value, utility or advantage to any
               person entitled to the benefit of the easement or
               covenant; or
               (iii) would be contrary to the public interest;
               or
          (c) for an easement or covenant under a building management
          statementâthe modification or extinguishment of the
          easement or covenantâ
               (i) can not be obtained by an amendment of the
               statement under the Land Act 1994, section 294F
               or the Land Title Act 1994, section 54E because
               the signature of all persons required for the
               amendment can not be obtained; and
               (ii) is just and equitable in the circumstances;
               and
               (iii) is reasonably necessary in the
               circumstances; or
          (d) each person entitled to the benefit of the easement or
          covenant can reasonably be considered to have abandoned, by
          an act or omission, the easement or covenant; or
          (e) each person entitled to the benefit of the easement or
          covenant has agreed to, or would not be substantially
          injured by, the modification or extinguishment of the
          easement or covenant.
     (4) However, the court may make an order under subsection (3) (c)
     only if the court is satisfied that each person who will suffer loss
     or other disadvantage from the modification or extinguishment of the
     easement or covenant can be paid an amount as adequate compensation
     for the loss or disadvantage.
     (5) In deciding whether to make an order under subsection (3) (a) or
     (b), the courtâ
          (a) must take into account the operation of the Planning
          Act 2016, including, for example, the planning scheme under
          that Act that applies to the benefited land and the
          burdened land; and
          (b) may take into account any other matter the court
          considers appropriate.
     (6) The court may make any order that the nature of the case
     requires, including, for example, any of the following ordersâ

          mentioned in subsection (4);
          (b) an order requiring the amendment of a document creating
          the easement or covenant to include a term relating to the
          use, repair or maintenance of the burdened land;
          (c) an order requiring the registration of a document

          "buyer") purchases the invalidly appointed property from
          the appointee.

     the extent of the appointeeâs entitlement to the property at that
     time.
     (4) For subsection (3), the appointeeâs entitlement to the property
