Reassessment
 
 
9 Reassessment
     (1) The Chief Commissioner may make one or more reassessments of a
     tax liability of a taxpayer.
     (2) A reassessment of a tax liability is to be made in accordance
     with the legal interpretations and assessment practices generally
     applied by the Chief Commissioner in relation to matters of that kind
     at the time the tax liability arose except to the extent that any
     departure from those interpretations and practices is required by a
     change in the law (whether legislative or non-legislative) made after
     that time.
     (3) The Chief Commissioner cannot make a reassessment of a tax
     liability more than 5 years after the initial assessment of the
     liability, unless--
          (a) the reassessment is to adjust tax to give effect to a
          decision on an objection or review as to an assessment, or
          (b) at the time the initial assessment or a reassessment
          was made, all the facts and circumstances affecting the
          liability under the relevant taxation law of the person in
          respect of whom the assessment or reassessment was made
          were not fully and truly disclosed to the Chief
          Commissioner and, as a result, the tax liability was
          assessed at a lower amount, or
          (c) the reassessment is authorised to be made more than 5
          years after the initial assessment by another taxation law,
          or
          (d) the reassessment is made as a consequence of an
          application by a taxpayer, being an application made within
          5 years after the initial assessment of the liability, and
          the reassessment reduces the tax liability.
     (4) The initial assessment of a tax liability remains the initial
     assessment of the liability for the purposes of this Act even if it
     is withdrawn under section 13.

     law.
          : Maximum penalty--250 penalty units.
          Note : An offence against subsection (1) committed by a
          corporation is an executive liability offence attracting
          executive liability for a director or other person involved
          in the management of the corporation--see section 121.
     (2) A defendant is not guilty of an offence under this section if the

          (a) if it is difficult or impracticable for the Chief
          Commissioner to determine a person's tax liability under a
          taxation law without undue delay or expense because of the
          complexity or uncertainty of the case or for any other
          reason, or
          (b) for the purpose of settling a dispute between the Chief
          Commissioner and a person concerning the person's tax
          liability (whether or not a previous assessment has been
          made).
     (2) The Chief Commissioner may, with the agreement of the taxpayer,
     assess liability in an amount specified in, or determined in
     accordance with, the agreement.

Section 16A
Land tax assessments--special provisions
 
 
16A Land tax assessments--special provisions
The validity of a land tax assessment for a land tax year (within the meaning
of the Land Tax Management Act 1956) is not affected by an objection or appeal
under the Valuation of Land Act 1916 in relation to a land tax assessment for a
subsequent land tax year, even if the objection or appeal results in a change
to a land valuation on which the earlier land tax assessment was partly based.
     Note : Under the Land Tax Management Act 1956 land tax assessments
     are based on an average value of land, being an average of the land
     value of the land in respect of the most recent 3 land tax years.
     This section prevents an objection to a land tax assessment from
     affecting the validity of previous land tax assessments that were
     based on one or 2 of the same land values.

          under a taxation law,

     (2) A
     "compliance notice" is a notice that advises a director or former
     director of a corporation that he or she will be liable to pay a
     corporate tax liability of the corporation if the failure to pay the
     corporate tax liability is not rectified before the end of a period
     specified in the notice (the

     (2A) The compliance period is to be a period of not less than 21 days
     from the date the notice is served on the director or former
     director.
     (3) For the purposes of this Division, a failure to pay a corporate

          (b) the Chief Commissioner makes a special arrangement with
          the corporation for the payment of the corporate tax
          liability, or

     former director on whom the compliance notice was served is jointly
     and severally liable with the corporation to pay the corporate tax
     liability.
     (4A) The Chief Commissioner is to issue to the director or former
     director a notice of assessment of the tax liability of the director
     or former director under this Division.

     liability because the person ceases to be a director of the
     corporation, but a former director of a corporation is not liable for
     any tax for which the corporation first became liable after the
     director ceased to be a director of the corporation.

     Review Act 1997 in respect of the determination.

          relates to a matter raised in an objection determined by
          the Chief Commissioner--the Chief Commissioner may rely on
          reasons previously given to the taxpayer by the Chief
          Commissioner under section 93 for the determination of the
          objection in explanation of that part of the assessment or

What is a tax avoidance scheme?
 
 
106F What is a tax avoidance scheme?
     (1) For the purposes of this Part, a
     "tax avoidance scheme" is a scheme that a person, whether alone or
     with others, enters into, makes or carries out for the sole or
     dominant purpose of enabling a tax liability to be avoided.
     (2) It does not matter if the scheme is entered into, made or carried
     out wholly or partly outside New South Wales.
     (3) In determining the sole or dominant purpose for which a scheme is
     entered into, made or carried out, any purpose related to avoiding a
     liability for foreign tax must be disregarded.
     (3A) For Division 3, a scheme that results in, or may reasonably
     result in, the constitution of a group under the Payroll Tax Act
     2007, section 74A is taken to be a tax avoidance scheme.
          Note--: Under the Payroll Tax Act 2007, section 74(4), the
          Chief Commissioner may determine that an entity and a
          former entity that are influenced by a third party do not
          constitute a group if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied
          the influence of the third party on the entity and a former
          entity is not, or was not, intended to avoid tax.
     (4) In this section--

     "foreign tax" means a duty, tax or other impost imposed under a law
     of another State, a Territory, the Commonwealth or a jurisdiction
     outside Australia.

          (i) the legal rights and obligations involved in the
          scheme, and
          (ii) the economic and commercial substance of the scheme,
     (c) when the scheme was entered into or made and the length of the
     period during which the scheme was carried out,
     (d) the purpose of a taxation law, or of a provision of a taxation
     law, whether or not the purpose is expressly stated,
     (e) the effect that a taxation law would have in relation to the
     scheme apart from this Part,
     (f) any change in a person's financial position, or other
     circumstances, that has resulted, will result, or may reasonably be
     expected to result, from the scheme,
     (g) the nature of any connection, whether of a business, family or
     other nature, between the person whose tax liability is avoided as a
     result of the scheme and another person whose financial position or
     other circumstances have changed, will change, or may reasonably be
     expected to change, as a result of the scheme,
     (h) the circumstances surrounding the scheme.

     (1) A person is liable to pay the amount of tax avoided by the person
     as a result of a tax avoidance scheme.
     (2) For the purposes of this Part, the
     "amount of tax avoided" by a person as a result of a tax avoidance
     scheme is the amount of tax that, if the tax avoidance scheme had not
     been entered into, made or carried out--
          (a) would have been payable by the person, or
          (b) it is reasonable to expect would have been payable by
          the person, assuming that a reasonable alternative to
          entering into or making the scheme had been adopted, being
          an alternative that would have achieved the same economic
          or commercial result as the scheme, other than the result
          of avoiding tax.
     (3) The Chief Commissioner may make an assessment, or reassessment,
     of tax liability on the basis of the person's liability under this
     Part to pay an amount of tax avoided by the person.

     (1) A liability to pay an amount of tax avoided by a person as a

     amount of tax avoided would have been payable if the tax avoidance
     scheme had not been entered into or made.
     (2) Accordingly, a tax default is taken to have occurred on the date
     the amount of tax avoided would have been payable if the tax
     avoidance scheme had not been entered into or made.
          Note--: This means that interest and penalty tax may be
          charged in addition to the amount of tax avoided.
     (3) This section applies only if the Chief Commissioner issues a
     notice of assessment, or reassessment, of tax liability on the basis
     that a scheme is a tax avoidance scheme.

          liability to the taxpayer, and
          (b) issues the notice on the basis that a scheme is a tax
          avoidance scheme.
     (2) The penalty--

Section 112
Public officer of corporation
 
 
112 Public officer of corporation
     (1) The Chief Commissioner may, by written notice served on a
     corporation, require the corporation to appoint, within a period
     specified in the notice, a natural person whose principal place of
     residence is in this jurisdiction as a public officer of the
     corporation for the purposes of the taxation laws, and to keep the
     office of public officer constantly filled by such a person.
     (2) An appointment of a public officer is not duly made until written
     notice of the appointment, specifying the name and residential
     address of the officer, has been lodged with the Chief Commissioner.
     (3) If--
          (a) the Chief Commissioner has required a corporation to
          appoint a public officer, and
          (b) the corporation does not make such an appointment as
          required or does not keep the office of public officer
          constantly filled as required,
     the Chief Commissioner may appoint a person as the public officer of
     the corporation by written notice served on the person and the
     corporation.
     (4) Service of a document on the public officer of the corporation is
     sufficient service on the corporation for the purposes of a taxation
     law, and, if at any time the corporation does not have a public
     officer as required under this section, then service on a person
     acting or appearing to act in the business of the corporation is
     sufficient.
     (5) The public officer is answerable for the discharge of all
     obligations imposed on the corporation under a taxation law, and, in
     case of default, is liable to the same penalties.
     (6) Everything that the public officer is required to do and does in
     his or her representative capacity is taken to have been done by the
     corporation, but the absence or non-appointment of a public officer
     does not excuse the corporation from the necessity of complying, or
     from a penalty for failure to comply, with a provision of a taxation
