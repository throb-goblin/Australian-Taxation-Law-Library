      "text": "(1) On the granting of a small-scale title, a landholder becomes entitled to compensation determined under this section in lieu of compensation for any compensable loss suffered, or likely to be suffered, by the landholder as a result of the exercise of the rights conferred by the small-scale title. Note : \"Small-scale title\" means a mineral claim or an opal prospecting licence. (2) The Minister may determine the compensation payable ( \"standard compensation\") for the purposes of subsection (1) and the quantum of any standard compensation is at the discretion of the Minister. (3) A determination of the Minister is to be made by order published in the Gazette and any such order-- (a) may prescribe different amounts of standard compensation for different mineral claims districts or opal prospecting areas, and (b) may provide for standard compensation to be indexed on an annual or other basis. (4) The Secretary must not grant a small-scale title to an applicant unless satisfied that-- (a) the applicant has paid to the collection agency on behalf of any landholder entitled to compensation on the granting of the small-scale title the standard compensation for the term of the small-scale title (unless the applicant and landholder have entered into an agreement as an alternative to standard compensation (a \"compensation agreement\")), and (b) the applicant has given, in the manner prescribed by the regulations, any such landholder a notice that states the applicant's intention to exercise rights under the small-scale title and that identifies (by map or otherwise) the land to which the small-scale title applies, and (c) if the application is for the renewal of a mineral claim, the applicant has, no later than 28 days after lodging the application, paid all outstanding amounts of compensation payable by the applicant to the landholder under the mineral claim (other than compensation that may be payable under a compensation agreement). (5) The Secretary may grant a small-scale title to an applicant despite the applicant failing to satisfy the Secretary of a matter specified in subsection (4) if the Secretary is satisfied that the failure occurred because the applicant, after taking all reasonable steps, has been unable to sufficiently identify a landholder for the purposes of this section. Nothing in this subsection affects the right of a landholder to compensation under this section. (6) The Land and Environment Court-- (a) may determine the compensation payable for the purposes of subsection (1) in respect of a small-scale title for which no standard compensation has been determined by the Minister, and (b) may make any such determination on the application of the landholder or the applicant for the small-scale title, and (c) in determining the compensation payable is to have regard to any determinations of standard compensation made by the Minister. (7) Compensation determined by the Court under subsection (6) is taken to be standard compensation in respect of-- (a) the grant of the relevant small-scale title, and (b) the grant of a renewal of the title (but only if the Minister does not, within the term of the title, make a determination of standard compensation in respect of the title). (8) The Land and Environment Court may, in exceptional circumstances and despite subsection (1), award a landholder compensation for the compensable loss suffered, or likely to be suffered, by the landholder as a result of the exercise of the rights conferred by a small-scale title, but only if-- (a) the application for such compensation is made to the Court no later than 60 days after the notice under subsection (4) (b) is given to the landholder in respect of the title, and (b) there is no compensation agreement in place in respect of the title between the landholder and the person from whom compensation is sought. (9) Division 3 does not apply to a determination of compensation under this section. However, sections 271, 272 (other than section 272 (1) (b) (i)) and 275 do apply to a determination of compensation under subsection (8). (10) No appeal lies against a determination of compensation under this section. (11) The Minister cannot vary or substitute a standard compensation amount previously determined by the Minister under this section unless-- (a) at least 5 years have passed since that previous determination, and (b) the Minister has caused an independent review to be conducted into the appropriate levels of standard compensation and has considered the findings of that review. (12) The regulations may make provisions for or with respect to the collection of standard compensation by the collection agency and the payment of that compensation to landholders, and in particular may-- (a) prescribe fees"

Section 2 Invitations for competitive selection applications (1) The decision-maker may by notice published in the Gazette invite applications ( \"competitive selection applications\") for the grant of a controlled release prospecting title in a specified area on the basis of competitive selection for the grant of the title. (2) An invitation for competitive selection applications can stipulate information that is to accompany the application in addition to information required to accompany the application under section 13 or 33. (3) An invitation for competitive selection applications can relate to more than one area of land. (4) The decision-maker may by notice published in the Gazette vary or withdraw an invitation for competitive selection applications, and the regulations may make provision for or with respect to the consequences of the variation or withdrawal of an invitation. (5) Section 136 does not apply to an invitation for competitive selection applications or to a competitive selection application. Section 3 Competitive selection process (1) The decision-maker is to determine the process for competitive selection for the grant of a controlled release prospecting title. (2) The process for competitive selection can be different for different areas of land and for different controlled release minerals. (3) An invitation for competitive selection applications is to include such information as to the process for competitive selection as the decision-maker considers appropriate. Section 3A Participation charge (1) A competitive selection application must be accompanied by the participation charge, if any, prescribed by the regulations. Section 4 Matters to be taken into account in competitive selection process (1) Without limiting any other provision of this Act, the decision- maker must take into account in the competitive selection process-- (a) any matter that the decision-maker is required under this Act to take into account in considering an application for the grant of an exploration licence or assessment lease, and (b) any matter prescribed by the regulations. (2) The decision-maker may determine any other matters that are to be considered in the competitive selection process and the weight or emphasis to be given to those matters. Section 5 Consideration for grant of controlled release prospecting title (1) An invitation for competitive selection applications can include a requirement for applications to include an undertaking that the applicant will pay an amount specified in the application or an amount determined through a competitive selection process as consideration offered for the grant of the controlled release prospecting title. (2) The process for competitive selection can include the public release of information as to the consideration offered by applicants for the grant of a controlled release prospecting title. (3) The amount of consideration undertaken to be paid by an applicant for the grant of a controlled release prospecting title is a factor that can be a relevant consideration in the competitive selection process. (4) The grant of a controlled release prospecting title can be delayed until the amount of any consideration payable for the grant of the title is paid or arrangements for payment or security for payment that are satisfactory to the decision-maker have been entered into. (5) Any amount paid as consideration for the grant of a controlled release prospecting title is not refundable in the event of the title being cancelled. Section 6 Determination of applications (1) After a competitive selection application has been considered in accordance with this Schedule, the application is to be dealt with and determined in accordance with the provisions of this Act as they relate to an application for an exploration licence or assessment lease (as appropriate). Accordingly, a power of the decision-maker under this Act to refuse an application for an exploration licence or assessment lease applies to a competitive selection application. Note : A competitive selection process does not guarantee that a controlled release prospecting title will be issued (because all competing applications may be refused). (2) If a competitive selection application fails to meet the requirements of the invitation in relation to which it is made, the application can be refused at any time during the competitive selection process without waiting for the process to be finalised.

      "text": "Schedule 2 - SCHEDULE 2 - Agricultural land (Sections 179 and 222 and cl 22, Sch 1) Section 1 Definitions (1) In this Schedule-- \"agricultural land\" means-- (a) land that has been sown with not less than 2 crops of an annual species during the period of 10 years immediately preceding the relevant date, or (b) land that has been sown with 1 crop of an annual species during the period of 10 years immediately preceding the relevant date if the relevant authority is satisfied that-- (i) having regard to the date on which the land was brought under cultivation, it would not be reasonable to expect more than one such crop to have been sown, and (ii) there was a sufficient reason for not having brought the land under cultivation at an earlier date, or (c) land on which-- (i) at the relevant date, trees are growing that provide shade or shelter or a windbreak to other land described in this definition, or (ii) at any time during the period of 10 years immediately preceding the relevant date, edible fruit or nut bearing trees, vines or any other perennial crop approved by the relevant authority have or has been growing, or (d) pastures-- (i) that are sown with seed of a species and at a rate of application, or treated with fertiliser of a composition and at a rate of application, satisfactory to the relevant authority, and (ii) that have, as a result of that sowing or treatment, maintained a level of pasture production that is substantially above that which might be expected of natural pastures, or (e) land that is used, to an extent acceptable to the relevant authority, for the production of grass seed, pasture legume seed, hay or silage, or (f) land that has a preponderance of improved species of pasture grasses. \"the relevant authority\" means the Secretary or any officer of the Department authorised by the Secretary to exercise functions under this Schedule. \"the relevant date\" means the date or dates with reference to which the relevant authority is required under clause 2 to decide whether or not any land is agricultural land. (2) For the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of \"agricultural land\" in subclause (1), land is not to be treated as having been sown with a crop of an annual species unless, in the opinion of the relevant authority, the crop sown was carried through to a successful use. Section 2 Decision by the relevant authority as to whether or not land is agricultural land (1) When the relevant authority is required to decide whether or not any land is agricultural land, the relevant authority must do so-- (a) in the case of a reference under section 179, by deciding whether or not the land was agricultural land on the date on which the application for the mineral claim concerned was lodged, and (b) in the case of a reference under section 222, by deciding whether or not the land was agricultural land on the date on which the notice, pursuant to which the objection referred to in that section was made, was served in accordance with section 221, and (c) in the case of a reference under clause 22 of Schedule 1, by deciding whether or not the land was agricultural land on the date on which the invitation for tenders for the mining lease concerned was first published or the application for the mining lease concerned was lodged. (2) If the Secretary, when referring a question for decision under clause 22 of Schedule 1, certifies a date pursuant to clause 3 of this Schedule, the relevant authority may not decide, pursuant to subclause (1) (c), that the land concerned is agricultural land unless satisfied that it was agricultural land on the date so certified. (3) The relevant authority may refuse to make a decision that land is agricultural land if the objector has not demonstrated to the relevant authority's satisfaction that the land is agricultural land. Section 2A Objections (1) An objection must be-- (a) lodged with the Secretary-- (i) for an objection under section 179 or 222-- within 28 days after the date the notice under section 177 or 221, as the case requires, is served, or (ii) for an objection under Schedule 1, clause 22--on or before the date specified in the relevant notice under Schedule 1, clause 21, and (b) made in a way prescribed by the regulations. (2) An objector must lodge with the Secretary information to support the objection in the way and within the period specified by the Secretary by written notice given to the objector, being a period of at least 28 days. (3) The Secretary may require an objector to provide further information to support the objection. (4) The further information must be provided in the way and within the period specified by the Secretary, being a period of at least 28 days. (5) If the further information is not provided within the specified period, the Secretary may reject the objection. (6) An objection may be withdrawn by written notice given to the Secretary. (7) The withdrawal of an objection is irrevocable. Section 2B Transfer of land if objection pending (1) If, before an objection has been determined, the landholder who made the objection transfers the land concerned to a new landholder-- (a) the landholder who made the objection must give the Secretary written notice of the transfer, and (b) the objection continues in force as if made by the new landholder, subject to subclauses (2) and (3). (2) If, before an objection has been determined, the Secretary becomes aware that land to which the objection relates has been transferred to a new landholder, the Secretary may, by written notice given to the new landholder, request the new landholder notify the Secretary, within 28 days, whether the new landholder wishes the objection to proceed. (3) If, at the expiry of the 28-day period, the new landholder has not notified the Secretary that the new landholder wishes the objection to proceed, the objection is taken to have been withdrawn. (4) To avoid doubt, a withdrawal of an objection under subclause (3) is irrevocable. Section 3 Date to be certified by Secretary (1) This clause applies if-- (a) an objection to the grant of a mining lease over land is made under Schedule 1, clause 22, and (b) the tenderer or applicant for the mining lease over the land was, at the time the invitation for tenders was first published or the application was lodged, the holder of an exploration licence or mineral claim over the land. (2) If this clause applies, the Secretary must issue a certificate that-- (a) states that the matters referred to in subclause (1) have occurred, and (b) specifies the date on which the invitation for tenders for the exploration licence was first published or the application for the exploration licence or mineral claim was lodged. (3) The certificate must be given to the following persons-- (a) the relevant authority, (b) the landholder, (c) the mining lease applicant. Section 4 Relevant authority may decide that part only of land is agricultural land If the relevant authority is required to decide whether or not any land is agricultural land, nothing in this Act operates so as to prevent the relevant authority from deciding that a part only of the land is agricultural land. Section 5 Relevant authority may commission expert reports Before deciding whether or not land is agricultural land, the relevant authority-- (a) may commission an expert to report on the question, and (b) must allow the landholder and the following persons to make submissions within a reasonable period on the report, including the assumptions of and information contained in the report-- (i) for a reference under section 179--the person who caused the notice under section 177 to be served, (ii) for a reference under Schedule 1, clause 22 in relation to a mining lease--the mining lease applicant, and (c) must consider the submissions, if any. Section 6 Parties may make submissions Before deciding whether or not land is agricultural land, the relevant authority must-- (a) provide a copy of the objection and supporting information to the following-- (i) for an objection under section 179, the person who caused the notice under section 177 to be served, (ii) for an objection under Schedule 1, clause 22, the mining lease applicant, and (b) allow the following to make submissions within a reasonable time on the objection and supporting information-- (i) for a reference under section 179, the person who caused the notice under section 177 to be served, (ii) for a reference under Schedule 1, clause 22, the mining lease applicant concerned, and (c) give a copy of the submissions to the landholder, and (d) allow the landholder to make submissions within a reasonable period commenting on submissions made under paragraph (b), and (e) consider the submissions, if any.
