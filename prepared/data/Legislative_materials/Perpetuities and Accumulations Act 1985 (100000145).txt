PERPETUITIES AND ACCUMULATIONS ACT 1985
- LONG TITLE
An Act to effect reforms in the rules of law relating to perpetuities and
accumulations
Section 1 Name of Act This Act is the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1985.
Section 2 Dictionary The dictionary at the end of this Act is part of this Act. Note 1 The dictionary at the end of this Act defines certain terms
used in this Act, and includes references ("signpost definitions")
to other terms defined elsewhere.
For example, the signpost definition '"trustee"--see
the Trustee Act 1925
, dictionary.' means that the term 'trustee' is defined
in that dictionary and the definition applies to this Act.
Note 2     A definition in the dictionary (including a signpost
definition) applies to the entire Act unless the definition, or another
provision of the Act, provides otherwise or the contrary intention otherwise
appears (see Legislation Act
, s 155 and s 156 (1)).
Section 2A A note included in this Act is explanatory and is not part of this Act. Note See the Legislation Act
, s 127 (1), (4) and (5) for the legal status of notes.
Section 3 Application of Act
     (1)     Except as provided by sections 12, 13 and 14, this Act
does not apply in relation to a settlement taking effect before the commencement
date.
     (2)     This Act applies in relation to a settlement exercising a power of
appointment, whether general or special, and taking effect on or after the
commencement date, whether or not it applies in relation to the settlement
creating the power of appointment.
     (3)     For subsection (2), a gift over in default of an appointment under a
power, whether general or special, shall be treated as a settlement exercising a
power of appointment.
     (4)     Where a provision of a will executed before the commencement date but
taking effect on or after that date creates an interest--
         (a)     if that provision would not have infringed the rule against
perpetuities if this Act had not been made--the provision shall take effect
as if this Act had not been made; or
         (b)     if that provision would have infringed the rule against perpetuities
if this Act had not been made--this Act applies to the provision.
Section 4 Application of Act to Territory
     (1)     The rule against perpetuities and the rule against perpetual trusts
bind the Territory.
     (2)     However, nothing in the rule against perpetuities, in the rule against
perpetual trusts or in this Act affects any settlement made by the
Territory.
     (3)     Subsection (1) has effect except so far as another Territory law
otherwise provides.
     (4)     Subsection (2) has effect despite the Legislation Act 2001
, section 121 (Binding effect of Acts).
Section 5 Time of effect of will For this Act, a will shall, in relation to a disposition contained in it, be deemed to take effect on the death of the testator.
Section 6 Member of class For this Act, a person shall be treated as a member of a class if in the person's case each and every condition identifying a member of the class
is satisfied.
Section 7 Powers of appointment
     (1)     For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, a power of
appointment shall be treated as a special power unless--
         (a)     in the settlement creating the power it is expressed to be exercisable
by 1 person only; and
         (b)     the power could at all times during its currency when that person is
of full age and capacity be exercised immediately by him or her to transfer to,
or otherwise vest in, himself or herself the whole of the interest governed by
the power without the consent of any person or compliance with any other
condition, not being a formal condition relating only to the mode of the
exercise of the power.
     (2)     Notwithstanding subsection (1), a power of appointment that would, but
for the fact that it was made exercisable only by will, have been a general
power shall be treated as a general power for the purpose of determining whether
an appointment under the power infringes the rule against
perpetuities.
     (3)     For this section, an authority shall be taken to be unconditional
notwithstanding any formal condition relating to the mode of exercise of the
power.
Section 8 Perpetuity period
     (1)     For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, the
perpetuity period applicable to an interest created by a settlement shall,
subject to this section, be 80 years from the date on which the settlement takes
effect.
     (2)     Where an appointment of an interest is made under a special power of
appointment, the perpetuity period shall be reckoned from the date on which the
settlement creating the power takes effect.
     (3)     Where a child who is en ventre sa m&egrave;re at the time when
the perpetuity period applicable to an interest created by a settlement would,
but for this subsection, have expired would, if that child had been born before
that time, have taken that interest, that perpetuity period shall be extended
until--
         (a)     the expiry of the date on which the child is born; or
         (b)     it becomes apparent that the child will not be born;
as the case requires.
     (4)     Subsection (3) does not apply unless, before the expiry of the
perpetuity period that would, but for that subsection, be applicable to the
interest created by the relevant settlement, the trustees under that settlement
have received notice, supported by a certificate signed by a duly qualified
medical practitioner who has examined the woman carrying the child in question,
that the child is en ventre sa m&egrave;re.
Section 9 Wait and see
     (1)     Where a provision of a settlement which creates an interest would, but
for this section or this section and section 10, infringe the rule against
perpetuities, the interest shall be treated, until such time (if any) as it
becomes certain that, notwithstanding section 10, it must vest, if at all, after
the end of the perpetuity period, as if the provision did not infringe that
rule, and its so becoming certain does not affect the validity of any thing
previously done in relation to the interest.
     (2)     Where a provision of a settlement which creates an interest consisting
of the conferring of a general power of appointment would, but for this section
or this section and section 10, infringe the rule against perpetuities, the
interest shall be treated, until such time (if any) as it becomes certain that,
notwithstanding section 10, the power will not be exercisable within the
perpetuity period, as if the provision did not infringe that rule.
     (3)     Where a provision of a settlement which creates an interest consisting
of the conferring of any power or right (except a general power of appointment)
would, but for this section or this section and section 10, infringe the rule
against perpetuities, the interest shall be treated as regards any exercise of
the power or right within the perpetuity period as if the provision did not
infringe that rule, and the provision shall be treated as infringing that rule
only if and so far as the power or right is not fully exercised within the
perpetuity period.
Section 10 Reduction of age and exclusion of class members
     (1)     Where--
         (a)     a provision of a settlement creates an interest and the vesting of the
interest depends on the attainment by a person of a specified age or by persons
of respective specified ages; and
         (b)     immediately before the expiration of the perpetuity period applicable
to that interest--
               (i)     that person has not attained the specified age, or any of those
persons has not attained the age specified in relation to that person, as the
case may be; and
               (ii)     the interest has not vested; and
         (c)     the provision is, by reason of the operation of section 9, to be
treated as if it did not infringe the rule against perpetuities;
the interest shall, for all purposes, be treated as if its vesting depended
on the attainment by the person, or each of the persons referred to in paragraph
        (b) (i), as the case requires, of the age that he or she has attained
immediately before the expiration of that perpetuity period.
     (2)     Where an interest to which subsection (1) applies is ulterior to any
other interest created by the settlement, that other interest shall not be
defeated or otherwise adversely affected by the operation of subsection
(1).
     (3)     Subject to section 11, where--
         (a)     a provision of a settlement creates an interest which is to be taken
by a class of persons; and
         (b)     immediately before the expiry of the perpetuity period applicable to
that interest--
               (i)     the interest has not vested; and
               (ii)     there is a person who is, or there are persons each of whom is, a
member of that class (whether under the operation of subsection (1) or
otherwise); and
               (iii)     the provision is, by reason only of the operation of section 9, to
be treated as if it did not infringe the rule against perpetuities;
in relation to that interest, that class shall be taken to comprise only
that person or those persons.
     (4)     Where this section has effect in relation to a provision, the
operation of this section does not affect the validity of any thing previously
done in relation to the interest created by the provision.
Section 11 Death of potential class member Where--
         (a)     section 10 (1) applies to an interest that is to be taken by a class
of persons; and
         (b)     a person would have been a member, or persons would have been members,
of that class (whether under the operation of section 10 (1) or otherwise) if
that person or those persons had survived to the expiry of the perpetuity period
applicable to that interest; and
         (c)     that person has, or those persons have, any children who survive to
the expiry of that perpetuity period;
those children will take, per stirpes, the interest that their
parent, or the respective interests that their parents, would have taken had
that parent or those parents survived to the expiry of that perpetuity
period.
Section 12 Administrative power of trustees
     (1)     The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate an administrative
power in relation to trust property during the subsistence of a beneficial
interest in the trust property.
     (2)     This section applies to an administrative power taking effect, and to
any exercise of an administrative power, before, on or after the commencement
date.
     (3)     In this section:
"administrative power" means any power of a trustee other than
a power to appoint, pay, transfer, advance, apply, distribute or otherwise deal
with trust property in or towards satisfaction of the interest of a beneficiary
under the trust or in or towards satisfaction of a purpose of the
trust.
Section 13 Remuneration of trustees
     (1)     The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate a power or other
provision for remunerating a trustee for the trustee's services.
     (2)     This section applies to a power or other provision for remunerating a
trustee taking effect before, on or after the commencement date.
Section 14 Superannuation and other funds
     (1)     The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate a fund established
by a settlement for the benefit of--
         (a)     employees; or
         (b)     self-employed persons; or
         (c)     domestic partners, children, grandchildren, parents, dependants or
legal personal representatives of employees or self-employed persons;
or
Note     For the meaning of domestic partner, see Legislation Act
, s 169.
         (d)     persons duly selected or nominated for that purpose by employees or

"self-employed persons" includes persons engaged on their own
behalf in any lawful profession, trade, occupation or calling.
Section 15 Determinable interests
     (1)     The rule against perpetuities operates to render invalid the provision
for determination of a determinable interest in the same manner as the rule
would operate to render invalid a condition subsequent in a settlement for
defeasance of the determinable interest on the same contingency, and where that
rule does so operate--
         (a)     the determinable interest shall not be so determinable; and
         (b)     a subsequent interest not itself rendered invalid by that rule shall
be postponed or defeated to the extent necessary to allow the determinable
interest to have effect free from the provision for determination.
     (2)     For this section, an interest created by, or a provision of, an
appointment or other exercise of a power in a settlement (except a general power
of appointment) shall be treated as an interest created by, or a provision of,
the settlement.
     (3)     Notwithstanding subsection (1), the rule against perpetuities shall
not apply to--
         (a)     a gift over from 1 charity to another; or
         (b)     any provision for the determination of a lease for breach of a
covenant or condition of the lease.
     (4)     In this section:
"determinable interest" means an interest created by a
settlement, being an interest which is, by a provision of the settlement,
determinable on a contingency.
"subsequent interest", in relation to a determinable interest
means an interest, whether vested or contingent--

settlement, or taking effect by way of reverter, resulting trust, residuary gift
or otherwise on a possibility arising under the settlement; and
         (b)     as regards which the determinable interest is a prior
interest.
Section 16 Options
     (1)     The rule against perpetuities does not apply to--
         (a)     any option to renew a lease; or
         (b)     an option to acquire for valuable consideration a reversionary
interest in the property comprised in a lease if the option is exercisable
only--
               (i)     by the lessee or the lessee's successors in title; and
               (ii)     during the currency of the lease.
     (2)     Where the rule against perpetuities operates to render invalid an
option, no action lies, in contract or otherwise, for giving effect to it or
making restitution for its lack of effect.
Section 17 Trusts for purposes which are not charitable
     (1)     Except as provided by this section, this Act shall not affect the
operation of the rule against perpetual trusts.
     (2)     Where, by a settlement, there is a disposition for a purpose, the
perpetuity period applicable to the disposition shall, for the purposes of the
rule against perpetual trusts, be 80 years from the date on which the settlement

         (a)     by a settlement, a disposition creates a trust for a purpose;
and
         (b)     the trust would, but for this section, infringe the rule against
perpetual trusts; and
         (c)     the term of the trust is determined by reference to the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of a contingency or contingencies specified in the
settlement;
the trust shall be treated as if it did not infringe the rule until such
time as it becomes certain that, by reason of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of
such a contingency, the term of the trust specified in the settlement will
exceed the perpetuity period, and its so becoming certain does not affect the
validity of anything previously done in relation to the trust.
     (4)     This section does not apply to a disposition for a purpose which is
charitable.
Section 18 Dependent interests
     (1)     Where a provision of a settlement creates an interest, the provision
is not rendered invalid by the rule against perpetuities or the rule against
perpetual trusts by reason only that the interest is ulterior to and dependent
upon an interest which is so invalid.
     (2)     Where a provision of a settlement creates an interest which is
ulterior to another interest and the other interest is rendered invalid by the
rule against perpetuities or the rule against perpetual trusts, the acceleration
of the vesting of the ulterior interest shall not be affected by reason only
that the other interest is so invalid.
Section 19 Accumulation of income
     (1)     Where property is disposed of in such a manner that the income of the
property may be or is directed to be accumulated wholly or in part, the power or
direction to accumulate that income is valid if the disposition of the
accumulated income is, or may be, valid, but not otherwise.
     (2)     This section does not affect the power of any person to terminate an
accumulation that is for the person's benefit, or any jurisdiction or
power of a court to maintain or advance out of accumulations, or any power of a
trustee under any law in force in the ACT or under any settlement.

that section continue to apply in relation to a settlement that took effect
before the commencement date.

Section 3 Legislation
history
This Act was originally a Commonwealth ordinance--the Perpetuities and Accumulations Ordinance 1985
 Ord1985-65 (Cwlth).
The Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988
 (Cwlth), s 34 (4) converted most former Commonwealth
ordinances in force in the ACT into ACT enactments. This allowed the ACT
Legislative Assembly to amend and repeal the laws. This Act was converted into
an ACT enactment on 11 May 1989 (self-government day).
As with most ordinances in force in the ACT, the name was changed from
Ordinance to Act by the Self-Government (Citation of Laws) Act 1989
 A1989-21, s 5 on 11 May 1989 (self-government day).
Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on their notification day unless
otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910
 (Cwlth), s 12).

Editorial changes
The Legislation Act 2001
, part 11.3 authorises the Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial

effect as if they had been made by an Act commencing on the republication date

considers they are desirable to bring the law into line, or more closely into
line, with current legislative drafting practice.
This republication does not include amendments made under part 11.3 (see
endnote 1).
