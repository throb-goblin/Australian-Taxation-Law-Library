             of an estate in fee simple in the land by instalments;
         (f)       a  licence  or  right  of  occupancy   granted   by   the
             Commonwealth   or   the   Territory   that   gives,   in   the

             of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern  Territory)  Act  1976
             (Cth) if the term of the lease is 15 years or more.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (4):
         (a)      an interest is not a relevant  interest  at  a  particular
             time unless the holder of  the  interest  has,  or  will  have
             within 12 months after that time (or a longer  period  allowed
             by the Commissioner), a right to immediate occupation  of  the
             land; and

             person who holds it subject to a trust; and

             a guardian holds the interest in trust; and
         (d)      an interest is not a relevant interest if  the  holder  of

             sublease mentioned in section 5(2).
      (4)   The Regulations may provide for recognition of  an  interest  (a
         non-conforming interest) as a relevant interest:

             provisions; and
         (b)      even though the interest may not be recognised at  law  or
             in equity as an interest in land.
      (5)   If a first home owner grant is to be paid in consequence of  the
         recognition of a non-conforming interest as  a  relevant  interest,
         the Commissioner may impose appropriate conditions on  the  payment
         of the grant to ensure its recovery if criteria prescribed  in  the

         of the applicant or the applicant's spouse  or  de  facto  partner,
         being:
         (a)       a  relevant  interest  in  residential  property  in  the
             Territory; or
         (b)      an interest in residential property in a State or  another

         spouse or de facto partner is taken not to have used  the  property
         as the residence of the applicant or the applicant's spouse  or  de

             applicant's spouse or de facto partner; and

         (b)      a first home owner grant was not paid  under  the  earlier
             application  because  the  Commissioner  did  not  exempt  the

             application relates is on or after 28Â AprilÂ 2015; and

             with the requirement under subsection (1).
Section 12A Ineligibility â threshold amount exceeded

             was paid a grant on an earlier application under this Act or a
             corresponding law for a home used  as  the  residence  of  the
             applicant, applicant's spouse or de facto partner; and

             (i) sectionÂ 13AA(1)(b), (c), (d) orÂ (e) because the  threshold

             (ii)      an  equivalent  provision  of  a  corresponding  law
                  because the threshold  amount  (however  described)  under
                  that law is exceeded (regardless  of  whether  the  amount
                  under that law is the same as under this Act).
         Note for subsection (1)
         Under section 41, an applicant is required to repay a grant if  the
         unencumbered value or consideration for the transaction results  in
         it not being an eligible transaction.
      (2)   Subsection  (1)  applies  even  if  the  applicant,  applicant's
         spouse or de facto partner:
         (a)      repaid the amount of the grant; and

             or
         (b)      the grant is paid before completion of a  transaction  and
             on completion the consideration for it results in it not being
             an eligible transaction under section 13AA(1)(b) or (d); or
         (c)      the grant was paid in anticipation of compliance with  the
             residence requirements and the person fails to comply with the
             requirements; or
         (d)      the Commissioner imposed a condition on  the  grant  under
             sectionÂ 5(5) or 20 and the person breaches the condition; or

             entitled occurs.
       (2)    The  person  must,  within  the  required  time  mentioned  in
         subsectionÂ (2A):
         (a)      give written  notice  to  the  Commissioner  of  the  non-

             overpayment; and
         (b)      pay to  the  Commissioner  the  amount  of  the  grant  or
             overpayment.
      (2A)  The required time is:
         (a)      for  non-entitlement  mentioned  in  subsection  (1)(a)  â
             30Â days after the grant was paid; or
         (b)      for ineligibility mentioned in subsection (1)(b) â 30Â days
             after the earlier of the following:
             (i) completion of the transaction;
             (ii)      the date on which it first became apparent that  the
                  transaction would not be an eligible transaction; or
         (c)      for failure to  comply  with  the  residence  requirements
             mentioned in subsection (1)(c) â 30Â days after the earlier  of
             the following:
             (i) the date by which the person  was  to  have  occupied  the
                  home;
             (ii)      the date on which it first became apparent that  the
                  residence requirements would not be complied  with  during
                  the period allowed for compliance; or
         (d)      for breach of a condition or an overpayment  mentioned  in
             subsection (1)(d)  or  (e)  â  30Â days  after  the  breach  or
             overpayment occurred.

         as required by subsection (2):

         (b)      the Commissioner may, by notice in writing to the person:
             (i) state why the amount in default must be paid; and
             (ii)      require payment of the amount in default  within  30
                  days after the date of the notice; and

             penalty) is not paid within 30  days  from  the  date  of  the
             notice, then, as from the end of that period, interest accrues
             on the penalty (in addition to the interest  already  accruing
             on the amount originally in default).
      (4)   An amount required to be paid to  the  Commissioner  under  this
         section is a debt due to the Territory and  may  be  sued  for  and

         suing in his or her official name.
      (5)   If a person who is liable to pay an amount  under  this  section
         has an interest in the home for which the first  home  owner  grant
         was paid, the liability is an overriding statutory  charge,  within
         the meaning of the Land Title Act 2000, on the person's interest in
         that home.
      (6)   The Commissioner  may  enter  into  an  arrangement  (which  may
         include provision for the payment of interest)  for  payment  of  a

         under subsection (3) commits a regulatory offence.
         Maximum penalty:    50 penalty units.

         owner  grant  may  be  found   guilty   of   an   offence   against
         subsectionÂ (8) even  if  the  condition  breached  is  subsequently
         amended or cancelled.
      (10)  Subsection (9) applies despite section 14 of the Criminal Code.
      (11)  If a first home owner grant was paid on the application of 2  or
         more persons, the liability of those persons under this section  is
         joint and several.

         rate as in force from time to time.
