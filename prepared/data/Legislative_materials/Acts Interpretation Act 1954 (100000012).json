(2) The appointment may be expressed to have effect only in the circumstances specified in the instrument of appointment. (3) The appointer mayâ (a) determine the terms and conditions of the appointment, including remuneration and allowances; and (b) end the appointment at any time. (3A) If the appointer is a body, the appointment may be made or ended by a resolution of the body. (4) The appointment, or the ending of the appointment under subsection (3) (b), must be in, or evidenced by, writing, signed by the appointer or, if the appointer is a body, by a person authorised by the body for the purpose. (5) If the appointee is acting in the office because of a vacancy in the officeâ (a) the term of the appointment may not be more than 1 year; and (b) the appointee may be reappointed to act in the office, but the term of each reappointment may not be more than 1 year. (6) If the appointee is acting in the office otherwise than because of a vacancy in the office and the office becomes vacant, then, subject to subsection (2), the appointee may continue to act untilâ (a) the appointer otherwise directs; or (b) the vacancy ends; or (c) the end of a year from the day of the vacancy; whichever happens first. (6A) Subsection (6) (c) does not prevent a further appointment of the appointee to act for a period ending later than a year from the day of the vacancy. (7) The appointment ends if the appointee resigns by writing signed and delivered to the appointer. (7A) If the vacancy in the office in which a person is acting ends, the personâs appointment to act in the office because of the vacancy also ends. (7B) If the holder of the office in which a person is acting resumes the office, the personâs appointment to act in the office because of the absence of the holder of the office ends. (7C) Subsections (7A) and (7B) apply even if a contrary intention appears in the instrument of, or evidencing the, appointment to act. (7D) A personâs substantive appointment to an office does not end merely because the person acts in another office. (7E) To avoid any doubt, it is declared that subsections (7A) to (7D) do not change the law of Queensland. (8) While the appointee is acting in the officeâ (a) the appointee has all the functions and powers of the holder of the office; and (b) laws apply to the appointee, and to other persons in relationship to the appointee, as if the appointee were the holder of the office. (9) Anything done by or in relation to a person purporting to act in the office is not invalid merely becauseâ (a) the occasion for the appointment had not arisen; or (b) the appointment had ended; or (c) the occasion for the person to act had not arisen or had ended. (10) If the Act authorises the appointer to appoint a person to act during a vacancy in the office, an appointment to act in the office may be made by the appointer whether or not an appointment has previously been made to the office. (11) Ifâ (a) the appointer is a specified officer or the holder of a specified office; and (b) the person who was the specified officer or holder of the specified office when the appointment was made ceases to be the officer or holder of the office; thenâ (c) the appointment continues in force; and (d) the person for the time being occupying or acting in the office concerned is taken to be the appointer for the purposes of this section. (12) Ifâ (a) the appointer is a body; and (b) there is a change in the membership of the body; thenâ (c) the appointment continues in force; and (d) the body as constituted for the time being is taken to be the appointer for the purposes of this section. (13) Writing purporting to be, or to contain, an appointment, or the ending of an appointment under subsection (3) (b), is evidence of the appointment or the ending of the appointment.

(2) The delegation may beâ (a) general or limited; and (b) made from time to time; and (c) revoked, wholly or partly, by the delegator. (3) The delegation, or a revocation of the delegation, must be in, or evidenced by, writing signed by the delegator or, if the delegator is a body, by a person authorised by the body for the purpose. (3A) If the delegator is a body, the delegation may be made or revoked by a resolution of the body. (3B) All conditions and preliminary steps required for the exercise of a delegation are presumed to have been satisfied and performed unless the contrary is established. (3C) Laws apply to the delegate, and to other persons in relationship to the delegate, in the performance of the delegated function or in the exercise of a delegated power as if the delegate were the delegator. (3D) Anything done by or in relation to the delegate in relation to the delegation is taken to have been done by or in relation to the delegator. Exampleâ Under an Act an evidentiary certificate purporting to be signed by an office holder is evidence of the content in any proceeding (the \"facilitation provision\"). The Act confers a general power of delegation on the office holder. The office holder uses the power to delegate the function of issuing the certificate to someone else. Under subsections (3C) and (3D) (and (6) and (7)), the facilitation provision is taken to provide for the certificate purporting to be signed by the delegate as having been signed by the delegator. (4) A delegated function or power may be exercised only in accordance with any conditions to which the delegation is subject. (5) The delegate may, in the performance of a delegated function or in the exercise of a delegated power, do anything that is incidental to the delegated function or power. (6) A delegated function or power that purports to have been performed or exercised by the delegate is taken to have been properly performed or exercised by the delegate unless the contrary is proved. (7) A delegated function or power that is properly performed or exercised by the delegate is taken to have been performed or exercised by the delegator. (8) If, when performed or exercised by the delegator, a function or power is dependent on the delegatorâs opinion, belief or state of mind, then, when performed or exercised by the delegate, the function or power is dependent on the delegateâs opinion, belief or state of mind. (8A) Ifâ (a) the delegator is a specified officer or the holder of a specified office; and (b) the person who was the specified officer or holder of the specified office when the delegation was made ceases to be the officer or holder of the office; thenâ (c) the delegation continues in force; and (d) the person for the time being occupying or acting in the office concerned is taken to be the delegator for the purposes of this section. (8B) Ifâ (a) the delegator is a body; and (b) there is a change in the membership of the body; thenâ (c) the delegation continues in force; and (d) the body as constituted for the time being is taken to be the delegator for the purposes of this section. (9) If a function or power is delegated to a specified officer or the holder of a specified officeâ (a) the delegation does not cease to have effect merely because the person who was the specified officer or the holder of the specified office when the function or power was delegated ceases to be the officer or the holder of the office; and (b) the function or power may be performed or exercised by the person for the time being occupying or acting in the office concerned. (10) A function or power that has been delegated may, despite the delegation, be performed or exercised by the delegator. (10A) The delegation of a function or power does not relieve the delegator of the delegatorâs obligation to ensure that the function or power is properly performed or exercised.
