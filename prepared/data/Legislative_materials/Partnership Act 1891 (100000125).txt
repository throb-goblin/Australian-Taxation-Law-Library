Limited partner not to take part in the management of the incorporated limited
partnership
*** 87 Limited partner not to take part in the management of the incorporated
limited partnership ***
     (1) A limited partner must not take part in the management of the
     business of the incorporated limited partnership.
     (2) Ifâ
          (a) as a direct result of any wrongful act or omission of a
          limited partner in taking part in the management of the
          business of an incorporated limited partnership, the
          limited partner causes any loss or injury to any person
          other than a partner in the partnership (a
          "third party"); and
          (b) at the time of the act or omission the third party had
          reasonable grounds to believe that the limited partner was
          a general partner in the partnership;
     the limited partner is liable for the loss or injury to the same
     extent that the limited partner would have been liable if the limited
     partner were in fact a general partner in the partnership.
          Noteâ
               A limited partner is not an agent of an
               incorporated limited partnership and the acts of
               a limited partner do not bind a general partner,
               another limited partner or the partnership
               itself. See section 84 (1).
     (3) A limited partner is not to be regarded as taking part in the
     management of the business of the incorporated limited partnership
     only because the limited partner or a person acting for the limited
     partnerâ
          (a) is an employee or an independent contractor of the
          partnership or of a general partner or an associate of the
          general partner, or is an officer of a general partner that
          is a body corporate; or
          (b) gives advice to, or for, the partnership or a general
          partner or an associate of the general partner in the
          proper performance of functions arising fromâ
               (i) the engagement of the limited partner in a
               professional capacity or a person acting on
               behalf of the limited partner in a professional
               capacity; or
               (ii) business dealings between the limited
               partner, or a person acting on behalf of the
               limited partner, and the partnership or between
               the limited partner and a general partner or an
               associate of the general partner; or
          (c) gives a guarantee or indemnity in relation to any
          liability of the partnership or of a general partner or an
          associate of the general partner; or
          (d) takes any action, or participates in any action taken
          by any other limited partner, for the purpose of enforcing
          the rights, or safeguarding the interests, of the limited
          partner as a limited partner; or
          (e) if permitted by the partnership agreementâ
               (i) calls, requisitions, convenes, chairs,
               participates in, postpones, adjourns or makes a
               record of a meeting of the partners or of the
               limited partners or of any of them; or
               (ii) whether at the meeting or in writing or
               otherwise, requisitions, formulates, signs,
               approves, disapproves, proposes, moves, supports,
               opposes, speaks to or votes on any resolution, or
               an amendment to any resolution of the partners or
               of the limited partners or of any of them; or
          (f) exercises a power conferred on the limited partner by
          subsection (4) or under the partnership agreement or
          otherwise has, or exercises, a right toâ

          (j) to the extent authorised by the partnership agreement,
          participates on, or has or exercises any right to appoint 1
          or more persons to, or remove 1 or more persons from, or to
          nominate 1 or more persons for appointment to or removal
          from, a committee that considers, approves of, consents to

               for any approval or disapproval of investments
               that the partnership does not otherwise have a
               right to make;
               (iv) a proposal relating to any actual or

          and equitableâ;
          (b) as if section 583 (d) were omitted;
          (c) any other modifications (within the meaning of the

                    application of provisions of the

                    purposes of that part in relation to
                    those Commonwealth provisions. This
                    does not apply to any provisions that
                    already apply to a matter as a law of
                    the Commonwealth.

     a function conferred on it under a law applied by subsection (3) â

     (5) Unless a function under a law applied by subsection (3) is
     conferred on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as
     referred to in subsection (4), that law applies as if a reference in
     it to the Commission were a reference to the chief executive.
