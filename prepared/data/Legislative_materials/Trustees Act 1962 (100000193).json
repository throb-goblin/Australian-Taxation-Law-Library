(3) An order under subsection (2) may provide that -- (a) any person to whom any assets, to which the section applies, were distributed, or his personal representative, shall pay to the person making the claim or to the trustee a sum not exceeding the value of those assets; or (b) any person, who has received, otherwise than in good faith and for valuable consideration, any interest in any assets, to which this section applies, from the person to whom they were distributed or his personal representative, shall pay to the person making the claim or to the trustee a sum not exceeding the value of that interest; and for the purpose of giving effect to that order the Court may make such further order as it thinks fit. (4) The remedies given to any person by this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies (if any) available to that person, and nothing, other than the provisions of subsection (7) and (8), restricts those other rights and remedies.

(6) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsection (5), where a trustee has made a distribution of any assets forming part of the estate of a deceased person or subject to a trust, and any person who is entitled to apply for an order under this section has, within the time specified in that subsection, applied to the Court for an order on the claim and that person was not aware of the distribution at the time when he made that application, the Court may hear an application by that person under this section after the expiration of the period prescribed by subsection (5), if it is made within 6 months after the date on which the person first became aware of the distribution, and may make an order accordingly. (7) Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, where a trustee has made a distribution of any assets forming part of the estate of a deceased person or subject to a trust -- (a) a person may exercise the remedies (if any) given to him by this section and all other rights and remedies available to him (including all rights that he may have to follow assets and any money or property into which they have been converted) without first exercising the rights and remedies (if any) available to him against the trustee in consequence of the making of the distribution; and (b) a person shall not exercise any remedy that may be available to him against the trustee in consequence of the making of the distribution, until he has exhausted all other remedies available to him, whether under this section or in equity or otherwise.
