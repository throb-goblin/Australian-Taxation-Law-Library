      "text": "This Act deals with certain actions to acquire interests in securities, assets or Australian land, and actions taken in relation to entities (being corporations and unit trusts) and businesses, that have a connection to Australia. These actions are called significant actions. For an action to be a significant action, the action must in most cases result in a change in control involving a foreign person or be taken by a foreign person.This Act also deals with actions taken by persons that have, or may have, implications for Australia&#39;s national security. These actions may or may not be significant actions. Actions relating to a national security business or national security land are notifiable national security actions. If an action is a reviewable national security action, or a significant action that is not a notifiable action or a notifiable national security action, the Treasurer may review the action if the Treasurer considers that the action may pose a national security concern.If a person proposes to take or has taken an action, the Treasurer has power to do one or more of the following: (a) decide that the Commonwealth has no objection to the action; (b) impose conditions on the action; (c) prohibit the action; (d) require the action to be undone (for example, by requiring the disposal of an interest that has been acquired).Offences and civil penalties apply for failing to comply with: (a) an order made prohibiting an action, or requiring an action to be undone; or (b) a condition imposed on an action.Significant actions that are notifiable actions, and notifiable national security actions, must generally be notified to the Treasurer before the actions can be taken. Offences and civil penalties may apply if a notifiable action is taken without a notice having been given. Broadly, if a notice has been given stating that a significant action is proposed to be taken, the action must not be taken before the end of a specified period (generally of 40 days, or an additional period of up to 90 days from the registration of an interim order).Fees are payable in relation to applications and orders made, and notices and notifications given, under this Act.A person must make and keep records for the purposes of this Act, including in relation to significant actions and notifiable actions. Information that is obtained for the purposes of this Act (called protected information) may be disclosed only for certain purposes. A person who obtains, uses or discloses protected information other than as authorised by this Act may commit an offence.The Register of Foreign Ownership of Australian Assets is kept under Part  7A.The Register records certain actions relating to interests acquired, held or disposed of by foreign persons. A foreign person who takes such an action (which may or may not be a significant action or a notifiable action, or otherwise covered by this Act) must give a register notice to the Registrar. In some circumstances, other people must also give notices to the Register. A civil penalty applies to a failure to give a notice under Part  7A."

For an action to be a significant action, the action must in most cases result in a change in control involving a foreign person or be taken by a foreign person.Generally, the action is only a significant action if the entity, business or land meets the threshold test. A different threshold test applies for certain significant actions taken in relation to agribusinesses.The regulations may also prescribe actions that are significant actions.An acquisition of an interest in Australian land by a foreign person that is specified in an exemption certificate under Division  5 is generally not a significant action.Division 6 deals with the treatment of entities whose securities are stapled and entities operating on a unified basis."

A similar provision for civil penalty provisions is found in section  92 of the Regulatory Powers Act, and applies to civil penalty provisions in this Act.An officer of a corporation who authorises or permits the corporation to commit an offence or contravene a civil penalty provision may also commit an offence or contravene a civil penalty provision. Similarly, an officer of a corporation may contravene a civil penalty provision by failing to prevent a contravention of the civil penalty provision by the corporation.The Regulatory Powers Act applies in relation to civil penalty orders, infringement notices, searches and enforceable undertakings under this Act. The Treasurer may give directions if the Treasurer has reason to believe that a person has engaged, or is engaging, in conduct that contravenes, or will contravene, this Act.A charge on Australian land may apply for unpaid penalties under this Act."

      "text": "Powers of Commissioner of Taxation as a result of delegation under section 137\n (1) If a power or function under a provision of this Act is delegated to the Commissioner of Taxation under section  137, the Commissioner has the general administration of this Act to the extent of administering the provision.\nNote: The provision is therefore a taxation law for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (among other laws). That Act contains a wide range of provisions about gathering, protecting and dealing with information, the exercise of powers and the performance of functions, under taxation laws, and the enforcement of taxation laws.\n (2) However, the following provisions of Schedule  1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 do not apply in relation to this Act:\n (a) section 255-10 (to defer the payment time);\n (b) Subdivision 255-D in that Schedule (security deposits);\n (c) Part 4-25 (charges and penalties), other than section 288-35 and Division  298 to the extent that it relates to that section;\n (d) Part 4-50 (release from particular liabilities);\n (e) paragraph 355-15(c) (application of Division 355);\n (f) Part 5-5 (rulings);\n (g) Division 444 (obligations of entities on behalf of other entities).\n (3) To avoid doubt, the Secretary or a person engaged under the Public Service Act 1999 who is employed in the Department may be a taxation officer (within the meaning of subsection 8J(1) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953) to the extent that this Act is a taxation law.\nPowers of Commissioner of Taxation as a result of delegation under section 101F\n (3A) Subsections (1) to (3) apply in relation to a delegation to the Commissioner of Taxation under section  101F in the same way as they apply in relation to a delegation to the Commissioner under section  137.\nNote: Section 101F allows for the delegation to the Commissioner of certain powers and functions under the Regulatory Powers Act (as it applies in relation to this Act).\n (3B) However, for the purposes of applying subsection  (2) in relation to a delegation to the Commissioner of Taxation under section 101F, treat that subsection as including the following paragraph:\n (da) sections 353-10 and 353-15 (powers to obtain information and evidence and access premises);\nPowers of Commissioner of Taxation as a result of request by Treasurer\n (4) The Treasurer may request, in writing, the Commissioner of Taxation to exercise his or her powers under section  353-10 or 353-15 (powers to obtain information and evidence and access premises) in Schedule  1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 in relation to a matter if a power or function has not been delegated to the Commissioner under section  137 in relation to the matter.\n (5) If the Treasurer does so, the Commissioner of Taxation (or an individual authorised by the Commissioner) may exercise his or her powers under those sections of that Act as if a reference in those sections to a taxation law included a reference to this Act to the extent that it relates to the matter."
