(2) However, a contract is not an eligible transaction if the commissioner is of the opinion that it forms part of a scheme to circumvent limitations on, or requirements affecting, eligibility or entitlement to a first home owner grant and the commissioner will, unless satisfied to the contrary, presume the existence of such a scheme, if-- (a) for a contract to purchase a home--the purchaser had an option to purchase the home granted before 1 July 2000 or the vendor had an option to require the purchaser to purchase the home granted before that date; or (b) for a comprehensive building contract--either party had a right or option granted before 1 July 2000 to require the other to enter into the contract; or (c) for a contract made on or after 1 September 2013 that-- (i) the contract replaces a contract made before Section 1 September 2013; and (ii) the replaced contract was-- (A) a contract for the purchase of the same home; or (B) a comprehensive home building contract to build the same or a substantially similar home.

(4) Subject to any qualifications prescribed under the regulations, an eligible transaction is \"completed\" when-- (a) for a contract for the purchase of a new home-- (i) the purchaser becomes entitled to possession of the home under the contract; and (ii) if the purchaser is to obtain a registered title to the land on which the home is situated--the necessary steps to obtain registration of the purchaser's title have been taken; or (b) for a contract to have a home built--the building is ready for occupation as a place of residence; or (c) for the building of a home by an owner-builder--the building is ready for occupation as a place of residence. Note For when certain transactions related to moveable buildings are completed, see s (5). (5) If a person purchases a moveable building and intends to use it as a place of residence on land in which the person has a relevant interest but on which it is not situated at the time of purchase-- (a) this Act applies as if the person were an owner-builder building a home on the land; and (b) the commencement date of the transaction is taken to be the date of the contract to purchase the moveable building; and (c) the transaction is taken to be completed when the moveable building is ready for occupation as a place of residence on land in which the purchaser has a relevant interest. (6) The consideration for an eligible transaction is-- (a) for a contract for the purchase of a new home--the consideration for the purchase; or (b) for a comprehensive home building contract--the total consideration payable for the building work; or (c) for the building of a home by an owner-builder--the actual costs to the owner of carrying out the work (excluding any allowance for the owner-builder's own labour). (7) In this section: \"comprehensive home building contract\" means a contract under which a builder undertakes to build a home on land from the inception of the building work to the point where the home is ready for occupation and if, for any reason, the work to be carried out under such a contract is not completed, includes any further contract under which the work is to be completed. \"contract for the purchase of a new home\" means a contract for the acquisition of a relevant interest in land on which a home is built. \"option\" to purchase includes a right of pre-emption or a right of first refusal. \"owner-builder\" means an owner of land who builds a home, or has a home built, on the land without entering"
