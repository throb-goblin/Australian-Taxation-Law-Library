Set-off for gains and losses (1) The court, when considering an action for breach of trust arising out of, or in respect of, an investment by a trustee where a loss has been or is expected to be sustained by the trust, may set off all or part of the loss resulting from that investment against all or part of the gain resulting from any other investment, whether in breach of trust or not. (2) The power of set-off under subsection (1) is in addition to any other power or entitlement to set off all or part of any loss against any property. 12F. Transitional provision Any provision in an Act or any other instrument, whether or not creating a trust, that empowers or requires a person to invest money in the investments authorised by the Trustee Act 1898 , is to be read as if it empowered or required that person to invest that money according to the provisions of this Part as to the investment of trust funds.

Power of appointing new trustees (1) Where a trustee, either original or substituted, and whether appointed by the Court or otherwise, is dead, or remains out of Tasmania for more than twelve months, or desires to be discharged from all or any of the trusts or powers reposed in or conferred on him, or refuses or is unfit to act therein, or is incapable of acting therein - (a) the persons nominated for the purpose of appointing new trustees in such event by the instrument, if any, creating the trust; or (b) if there is no such person or no such person able and willing to act, the surviving or continuing trustees or trustee, or the personal representatives of the last surviving or continuing trustee - may, by writing, appoint another person or other persons to be a trustee or trustees in the place of the trustee dead, remaining out of Tasmania, desiring to be discharged, refusing, or being unfit, or being incapable, as aforesaid. (2) On the appointment of a new trustee for the whole or any part of trust property - (a) the number of trustees may be increased; (b) a separate set of trustees may be appointed for any part of the trust property, whether held on trusts distinct from those relating to any other part of the trust property or not, and notwithstanding that no new trustees are to be appointed for other parts of the trust property; and any existing trustee may be appointed or remain one of such separate set of trustees, or, if only one trustee was originally appointed, then one separate trustee may be so appointed for the first-mentioned part; (c) it shall not be obligatory to appoint more than one new trustee where only one trustee was originally appointed, or to fill up the original number of trustees where more than two trustees were originally appointed; but, except where only one trustee was originally appointed, a trustee shall not be discharged under this section from his trust unless there will be at least two trustees to perform the trust; and (d) any assurance or thing requisite for vesting the trust property, or any part thereof, jointly in the persons who are the trustees, shall be executed or done. (3) Every new trustee so appointed, as well before as after all the trust property becomes by law, or by assurance, or otherwise, vested in him, shall have the same powers, authorities and discretions, and may in all respects act as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument, if any, creating the trust. (4) The provisions of this section relative to a trustee who is dead include the case of a person nominated trustee in a will but dying before the testator, and those relative to a continuing trustee include a refusing or retiring trustee, if willing to act in the execution of the provisions of this section.

(2) No sale made by a trustee shall, after the execution of the conveyance, be impeached as against the purchaser upon the ground that any of the conditions subject to which the sale was made may have been unnecessarily depreciatory, unless it appears that the purchaser was acting in collusion with the trustee at the time when the contract for sale was made.

(2) A trustee may appoint a financial institution or Australian legal practitioner to be his agent to receive and give a discharge for any money payable to the trustee under or by virtue of a policy of assurance, by permitting the financial institution or Australian legal practitioner to have the custody of, and to produce, the policy of assurance, with a receipt signed by the trustee; and a trustee is not chargeable with a breach of trust by reason only of his having made or concurred in making any such appointment. (3) Nothing in this section shall exempt a trustee from any liability which he would have incurred if this Act had not been passed in case he permits any such money, valuable consideration, or property to remain in the hands or under the control of the financial institution or Australian legal practitioner for a period longer than is reasonably necessary to enable the financial institution or Australian legal practitioner, as the case may be, to pay or transfer the same to the trustee. (4) Nothing in this section shall authorize a trustee to do anything which he is in express terms forbidden to do, or to omit to do anything which he is in express terms directed to do, by the instrument creating the trust. 21.

Power of trustees of renewable leaseholds to renew and to raise money for the purpose (1) A trustee of any leaseholds for lives or years which are renewable from time to time, either under any covenant or contract, or by custom or usual practice, may, if he thinks fit, and shall if thereto required by any person having any beneficial interest, present or future or contingent, in the leaseholds, use his best endeavours to obtain a renewed lease of the same lands on the accustomed and reasonable terms, and for that purpose may make or concur in making a surrender of the lease for the time being subsisting, and do all such other acts as are requisite: Provided that, when by the terms of the settlement or will the person in possession for his life or other limited interest is entitled to enjoy the trust property without any obligation to renew or to contribute to the expense of renewal, the consent in writing of that person must be obtained to the renewal on the part of the trustee. (2) If money is required to pay for the renewal, the trustee effecting the renewal may pay the same out of any money then in his hands in trust for the persons beneficially interested in the lands to be comprised in the renewed lease, and if he has not in his hands sufficient money for the purpose, he may raise the money required by mortgage of the lands to be comprised in the renewed lease, or of any other lands for the time being subject to the uses or trusts to which those lands are subject; and any person advancing money upon a mortgage purporting to be given under this power is not bound to see that the money is wanted, or that no more is raised than is wanted for the purpose. (3) Nothing in this section shall authorize a trustee to do anything which he is in express terms forbidden to do, or to omit to do anything which he is in express terms directed to do, by the instrument creating the trust. 23. Power of trustee to give receipts The receipt in writing of a trustee or of any person thereto authorized by him in writing, or, where there are several trustees, of any person or of any one or more of such trustees thereto respectively authorized by the trustees in writing for any money, securities, or other personal property or effects payable, transferable, or deliverable to him or them, as the case may be, under any trust or power, is a sufficient discharge for the same, and effectually exonerates the person paying, transferring, or delivering the same from seeing to the application or being answerable for any loss or misapplication thereof. 24. Power of executors and trustees to compound, &c. (1) An executor, trustee, or administrator may pay or allow any debt or claim on any evidence that he thinks sufficient.

(2) Subject to this section, a trustee who is temporarily out of, or is about to depart temporarily from, this State and who is not expressly forbidden to do so by the instrument creating the trust may, notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, delegate to any person resident in this State the execution or exercise of all or any of the trusts, powers, authorities, and discretions vested in him as trustee, whether alone or jointly with any other person or persons. (3) A delegation under this section shall be by power of attorney executed as a deed. (4) The power to delegate conferred by subsection (2) shall not be exercised in favour of a person who is the only other co-trustee unless that person is The Public Trustee or a trustee company. (5) Notwithstanding the power to delegate conferred by this section, a trustee may not exercise that power unless his co-trustee or co-trustees (if any) and such other person as is empowered to appoint trustees by the instrument (if any) creating the trust, consent by the same or another deed to the delegation. (6) Where a delegation by a trustee under this section has been duly made to, and accepted by, a person and is for the time being in operation, that person has, within the scope of the delegation, the same trusts, powers, authorities, discretions, liabilities, and responsibilities (except the power of delegation conferred by this section) as he would have if he were then the trustee. (7) The donor of a power of attorney under this section is liable for the acts and defaults of the donee as if they were his own acts and defaults, and the donee is subject to the jurisdiction and powers of any court so far as respects the execution of the trust delegated to him in the same manner as if he were the trustee.

(10) Notwithstanding that a power of attorney under this section - (a) has never come into operation; (b) has ceased to operate; or (c) has been revoked by the act of the donor of the power or his death or by operation of law - any act done or instrument executed by the donee of the power is as valid and effectual in favour of a person dealing with the donee as if the power had come into operation and remained in operation or been unrevoked at the time when the act was done or the instrument was executed, unless that person had, at that time, actual notice that the power had never come into operation, had ceased to operate, or had been revoked. (11) Notwithstanding that the donor of a power of attorney under this section has not obtained the consent or consents required by subsection (5) , any act done, or instrument executed, by the donee of the power is as valid and effectual in favour of a person dealing with the donee as if that consent or those consents had been properly obtained, unless that person had, at the time when the act was done or the instrument was executed, actual notice that the consent or consents had not been obtained.

(14) Where it is intended that the donee of a power of attorney under this section shall be entitled to transfer, or otherwise deal with, land to which the Land Titles Act 1980 applies, the power shall be in the form, and executed and attested in the manner, prescribed by that Act.

Implied indemnity of trustees (1) A trustee shall, without prejudice to the provisions of the instrument, if any, creating the trust, be chargeable only for money and securities actually received by him notwithstanding his signing any receipt for the sake of conformity, and shall be answerable and accountable only for his own acts, receipts, neglects, or defaults, and not for those of any other trustee, nor for any banker, broker, or other person with whom any trust moneys or securities may be deposited, nor for the insufficiency or deficiency of any securities, nor for any other loss, unless the same happens through his own wilful default. (2) A trustee may reimburse himself, or pay or discharge out of the trust estate, all expenses incurred in or about the execution of his trusts or powers. 28. Right of beneficiary to apply to trustee for accounts (1) If any person beneficially interested in any property subject to any trust shall apply in writing to any trustee administering such trust for true and accurate accounts as to the state of the trust property, and of all receipts and payments on account thereof, such trustee shall, at the expense of the person requiring the same, render such accounts in accordance with the application within 28 days after the receipt thereof, provided that no such true and accurate accounts have been rendered during the 12 months preceding the receipt of such application. (2) If any trustee neglects or refuses to render such accounts as aforesaid, he shall be personally liable to pay all costs and expenses incident to obtaining the same, upon an application to the Court under the provisions of the Supreme Court Civil Procedure Act 1932 . 29. Power of trustees to make advances to beneficiaries (1) Trustees may at any time pay or apply any capital money subject to a trust, for the advancement or benefit, in such manner as they may, in their absolute discretion think fit, of any person entitled to the capital of the trust property or of any share thereof, whether absolutely or contingently on his attaining any specified age or on the occurrence of any other event, or subject to a gift over on his death under any specified age or on the occurrence of any other event, and whether in possession or in remainder or reversion, and such payment or application may be made notwithstanding that the interest of such person is liable to be defeated by the exercise of a power of appointment or revocation, or to be diminished by the increase of the class to which he belongs: Provided that - (a) the money so paid or applied for the advancement or benefit of any person shall not exceed altogether in amount one-half of the presumptive or vested share or interest of that person in the trust property; (b) if that person is or becomes absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to a share in the trust property the money so paid or applied shall be brought into account as part of such share; (c) no such payment or application shall be made so as to prejudice any person entitled to any prior life or other interest, whether vested or contingent, in the money paid or applied unless such person is in existence and of full age and consents in writing to such payment or application. (2) This section applies only where the trust property consists of money or securities or of property held upon trust for sale, calling in, and conversion, and such money or securities, or the proceeds of such sale, calling in, and conversion are not by statute or in equity considered as land, or applicable as capital for the purposes of the Settled Land Act 1884 .

Protective trusts (1) Where any income, including an annuity or other periodical income payment, is directed to be held on protective trusts for the benefit of any person (in this section called \"the principal beneficiary\") for the period of his life or for any less period, then, during that period (in this section called the \"trust period\") the said income shall, without prejudice to any prior interest, be held on the following trusts, namely: (a) Upon trust for the principal beneficiary during the trust period or until he, whether before or after the termination of any prior interest, does or attempts to do or suffers any act or thing, or until any event happens other than an advance under any statutory or express power, whereby, if the said income were payable during the trust period to the principal beneficiary absolutely during that period, he would be deprived of the right to receive the same or any part thereof, in any of which cases, as well as on the termination of the trust period, whichever first happens, this trust of the said income shall fail or determine; (b) If the trust aforesaid fails or determines during the subsistence of the trust period, then, during the residue of that period, the said income shall be held upon trust for the application thereof for the maintenance or support, or otherwise for the benefit, of all or any one or more exclusively of the other or others of the following persons, that is to say: (i) The principal beneficiary and his or her spouse, if any, and his or her children or more remote issue, if any; or (ii) If there is no spouse or issue of the principal beneficiary in existence, the principal beneficiary and the persons who would, if he were actually dead, be entitled to the trust property or the income thereof or to the annuity fund, if any, or arrears of the annuity, as the case may be- as the trustees in their absolute discretion, without being liable to account for the exercise of such discretion, think fit. (2) This section does not apply to trusts coming into operation before the commencement of this Act, and has effect subject to any variation of the implied trusts aforesaid contained in the instrument creating the trust. (3) Nothing in this section operates to validate any trust which would, if contained in the instrument creating the trust, be liable to be set aside. PART IV - Trustee Companies 31. Power of trustee companies to act for two or more trustees A company authorized by law to act as a trustee shall, where appointed trustee, be deemed to constitute for all purposes a trusteeship of more than one trustee, and may be appointed to act, or to continue to act as trustee, where two or more trustees are, by Act or other instrument, required to execute the trust, unless the instrument creating the trust expressly prohibits such appointment or action; and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereinbefore contained, in any such case any retiring trustee may be discharged although there will not be two or more trustees left to perform the trust. PART V - Powers of the Court 32. Power of Court to appoint new trustees (1) The Court may, whenever it is expedient to appoint a new trustee or new trustees, and it is found inexpedient, difficult, or impracticable so to do without the assistance of the Court, make an order for the appointment of a new trustee or new trustees either in substitution for or in addition to any existing trustee or trustees, or although there is no existing trustee. In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, the Court may make an order for the appointment of a new trustee in substitution for a trustee who is convicted of a crime of such a nature that the Court considers he should be removed; or who is bankrupt, or is incapable, by reason of mental disorder, of exercising his functions as trustee. (2) An order under this section, and any consequential vesting order or conveyance, shall not operate further or otherwise as a discharge to any former or continuing trustee than an appointment of new trustees under any power for that purpose"

(8) The provisions of this Act as to vesting orders apply to shares in ships registered under the Acts relating to merchant shipping as if they were stock. 35. Orders as to contingent rights of unborn persons Where any property is subject to a contingent right in an unborn person or class of unborn persons who on coming into existence would, in respect thereof, become entitled to or possessed of the property on any trust, the Court may make an order releasing the property from the contingent right, or may make an order vesting in any person the estate to or of which the unborn person or class of unborn persons would, on coming into existence, be entitled or possessed in the property. 36. Vesting order in place of conveyance by certain persons under disability Where any person entitled to or possessed of any property, or entitled to a contingent right in any property by way of security for money, is an infant, or an involuntary patient within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 2013 , the Court may make an order vesting or releasing or disposing of the property or right in like manner as in the case of an infant trustee. 37.

Vesting order consequential on judgment for specific performance Where a judgment is given for the specific performance of a contract concerning any land, or for the partition, or sale in lieu of partition or exchange, of any land, and generally when a judgment is given for the conveyance of any land either in cases arising out of the doctrine of election or otherwise, the Court may declare that any of the parties to the action are trustees of the land or any part thereof within the meaning of this Act, or may declare that the interests of unborn persons who might claim under any party to the action, or under the will or voluntary settlement of any person deceased who was during his lifetime a party to the contract or transactions concerning which the judgment is given, are the interests of persons who, on coming into existence, would be trustees within the meaning of this Act, and thereupon the Court may make a vesting order relating to the rights of those persons, born and unborn, as if they had been trustees. 40. Effect of vesting order A vesting order made under any of the foregoing provisions shall, in the case of a vesting order consequential on the appointment of a new trustee, have the same effect as if the persons who before the appointment were the trustees, if any, had duly executed all proper conveyances of the property for such estate as the Court directs, or if there is no such person, or no such person of full capacity, then as if such person had existed and been of full capacity and had duly executed all proper conveyances of the property for such estate as the Court directs, and shall in every other case have the same effect as if the trustee or other person or description or class of persons to whose rights or supposed rights the said provisions respectively relate had been an ascertained and existing person of full capacity, and had executed a conveyance or release to the effect intended by the order. 41. Power to appoint person to convey In all cases where a vesting order can be made under any of the foregoing provisions the Court may, if it is more convenient, appoint a person to convey or transfer the property or release the contingent right; and a conveyance, transfer, or release by that person in conformity with the order shall have the same effect as an order under the appropriate provision. 42.

Persons entitled to apply for orders (1) An order under this Act for the appointment of a new trustee or concerning any property subject to a trust, may be made on the application of any person beneficially interested in the property, whether under disability or not, or on the application of any person duly appointed trustee thereof. (2) An order under this Act concerning any property subject to a mortgage may be made on the application of any person beneficially interested in the equity of redemption, whether under disability or not, or of any person interested in the money secured by the mortgage. 43. Powers of new trustee appointed by Court Every trustee appointed by the Court shall, as well before as after the trust property becomes by law, or by assurance, or otherwise, vested in him, have the same powers, authorities, and discretions, and may in all respects act as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument, if any, creating the trust. 44. Power to charge costs on trust estate The Court may order the costs and expenses of and incident to any application for an order appointing a new trustee, or for a vesting order, or of and incident to any such order, or any conveyance or transfer in pursuance thereof, to be paid or raised out of the land or personal estate in respect whereof the same is made, or out of the income thereof, or to be borne and paid in such manner and by such persons as to the Court may seem just. 45. Trustees of charities The powers conferred by this Act as to vesting orders may be exercised for vesting any property in any trustee of a charity or society over which the Court would have jurisdiction upon proceedings duly instituted, whether the appointment of the trustee was made by instrument under a power or by the Court under its general or statutory jurisdiction. 46. Orders made upon certain allegations to be conclusive evidence Where a vesting order as to any property is made under this Act, or under any Act relating to insanity founded on an allegation of the personal incapacity of a trustee, or on an allegation that a trustee or the representative of a mortgagee is out of the jurisdiction of the Court or cannot be found, or that it is uncertain which of several trustees, or which of several devisees of a mortgagee was the survivor, or whether the last trustee or the representative of a mortgagee is living or dead, or on an allegation that there is no representative of a trustee or mortgagee, or on an allegation that any trustee or mortgagee has died intestate without a representative, or has died and it is not known who is his representative, or has died and it is uncertain whether he died intestate or who is his representative, the fact that the order has been so made shall be conclusive evidence of the matter so alleged in any court upon any question as to the validity of the order; but this section shall not prevent the Court from directing a reconveyance or the payment of costs occasioned by any such order if it was improperly obtained. 47. Power of Court to make orders in certain cases not provided for by trust instruments, &c. (1) Where in the management or administration of any property vested in trustees, any sale, lease, mortgage, surrender, release, or other disposition, or any purchase, investment, acquisition, expenditure, or other transaction is, in the opinion of the Court, expedient, but the same cannot be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that purpose vested in the trustees by the trust instrument, if any, or by law, the Court may by order confer upon the trustees, either generally or in any particular instance, the necessary power for the purpose, upon such terms, and subject to such provisions and conditions, if any, as the Court may think fit, and may direct in what manner"

Power to sanction sale of land or minerals separately (1) When a trustee or other person is for the time being authorized to dispose of land by way of sale, exchange, or partition, the Court may sanction his so disposing of the land with an exception or reservation of any minerals, and with or without rights and powers of or incidental to the working, getting, or carrying away of the minerals, or so disposing of the minerals, with or without the said rights or powers, separately from the residue of the land.
