to the capital of the partnership and would be entitled to a 25% share of any
surplus on dissolution of the partnership in respect of capital. The sole
partnership property is land with an unencumbered value of $4 million. The
registered proprietor of the land is a person who holds the land as custodian
for the benefit of the partnership. The liabilities of the partnership are $3
million. Under this section, each partner is taken to have a 25% beneficial
interest in the land without regard to any liabilities of the
partnership.

     (4)     In this section&#8212;

"partnership interest", of a partner, means the proportion of
any surplus to which the partner would be entitled in respect of capital if the
partnership were to be dissolved;

"partnership property" has the same meaning as in section 24(1)
of the Partnership Act 1958.

Imposition of absentee owner land tax surcharge 

     (1)     This section applies if&#8212;

         (a)     land tax was purportedly imposed in respect of a tax year on taxable
land; and

         (b)     the rate of land tax purportedly imposed on the taxable land was the
rate set out in Part 4 or Part 5 of Schedule 1; and

         (c)     the land tax was purportedly payable on or after
1 January 2018 and before 8 April 2024; and

         (d)     the purported imposition of land tax at the rate referred to in
paragraph (b) was invalid only because the provisions of this Act that
purportedly imposed the land tax were to any extent invalid or inoperative under
section 109 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth because of an
inconsistency with a provision of an agreement given the force of law by
section 5(1) of the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 of the
Commonwealth.  

     (2)     Land tax is imposed on the taxable land to which subsection (1)
applies. 

     (3)     The liability for land tax imposed under subsection (2) is taken
to have arisen, and to have always arisen, at the same time as liability for the
purported land tax would have arisen if the purported land tax had been validly
imposed. 

     (4)     Land tax imposed under subsection (2) is payable by, and is taken
to have always been payable by, the person who would have been liable for the
purported land tax if the purported land tax had been validly imposed.

     (5)     The amount of land tax payable under subsection (2) is the same
amount, and is taken to have always been the same amount, as the amount of land
tax that would have been payable if the purported land tax had been validly
imposed. 

     (6)     The rights and liabilities of a person in relation to land tax imposed
under subsection (2) are taken to be, and to have always been, the same as
if the purported land tax had been validly imposed. 

     (7)     Any act or thing done or omitted to be done by a person in relation to
the purported land tax has, and is taken to have always had, the same force and
effect as if it were done or omitted to be done in relation to land tax imposed
under subsection (2).

     (8)     In this section&#8212;

"purported land tax", in relation to taxable land, means land
tax referred to in subsection (1) that was purportedly imposed on the
taxable land.

     1.     Alpha (as trustee of the Alpha Unit Trust) owns taxable land.

     2.     The sole unitholder of the Alpha Unit Trust is Bravo (as trustee
of the Bravo Unit Trust). 

The unitholders of the Bravo Unit Trust are&#8212;

     &#8226;     Absentee Beneficiary 1, who has a 40% unitholding;
and

     &#8226;     Non-absentee Beneficiary 1, who has a 40% unitholding;
and

     &#8226;     Absentee Beneficiary 2, who has a 20% unitholding. 

     3.     The Bravo Unit Trust is an absentee trust because it has at least
one absentee beneficiary&#8212;see paragraph (b) of the definition of
absentee trust.
The Alpha Unit Trust is also an absentee trust because its unitholder,
Bravo, is an absentee beneficiary holding an interest as trustee of an absentee
trust&#8212;see paragraph (b) of the definition of "absentee trust"
and paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of absentee
beneficiary.

     4.     The Alpha Unit Trust and the Bravo Unit Trust are in a chain of
trusts&#8212;see section 3D.

     5.     The absentee proportion of interests in land subject to the Alpha Unit
Trust is calculated as follows&#8212;

Step 1&#8212;calculate Absentee Beneficiary 1's interest in the
land

Multiply Absentee Beneficiary 1's interest in the Bravo Unit Trust

Unit Trust (100%).

40% &#215; 100% = 40%.

Step 2&#8212;calculate Absentee Beneficiary 2's interest in the land

Multiply Absentee Beneficiary 2's interest in the Bravo Unit Trust
(20%) by Bravo's interest (as trustee of the Bravo Unit Trust) in the Alpha
Unit Trust (100%).

20% &#215; 100% = 20%.

Step 3&#8212;add together the amounts calculated under Step 1 and
Step 2

40% + 20% = 60%.

Example 2

     1.     Alpha (as trustee of the Alpha Fixed Trust) owns taxable land.

     4.     The Alpha Fixed Trust, the Bravo Fixed Trust and the Charlie Fixed
Trust are in a chain of trusts&#8212;see section 3D. 

     5.     The absentee proportion of interests in land subject to the Alpha Fixed

land

Multiply Absentee Beneficiary 2's interest in the Bravo Fixed Trust
(30%) by Bravo's interest (as trustee of the Bravo Fixed Trust) in the Alpha
Fixed Trust (50%).

30% &#215; 50% = 15%.

Step 3&#8212;add together the amounts calculated under Step 1 and Step
2

25% + 15% = 40%.

Example 3

     1.     Alpha (as trustee of the Alpha Fixed Trust) owns taxable land.

reading speech&#8212;

Legislative Assembly: 8 September 2005

The long title for the Bill for this Act was "to re-enact and modernise the
law relating to land tax, to repeal the Land Tax Act 1958, to amend the
Taxation Administration Act 1997 and other Acts and for other
purposes."

The Land Tax Act 2005 was assented to on 29 November 2005 and came
into operation on 1 January 2006: section 2.

INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984
(ILA)

Style changes

Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out
in Schedule 1 to that Act.

References to ILA s. 39B

Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended by
the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section or
clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the insertion of
the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or
clause.

Interpretation

As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the
following effects:

&#8226;     Headings

All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed before 1
January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that
Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule;
sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms. 
See section 36(1A)(2A).

&#8226;     Examples, diagrams or notes

All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on
or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).

&#8226;     Punctuation

All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January
2001 forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was
passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B).

&#8226;     Provision numbers

All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  See
section 36(3C).

&#8226;     Location of "legislative items"

A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13
October 2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to
be at the foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another
legislative item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at
the foot of a provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items
will be regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section
36B.
