PERPETUITIES ACT 1984
- LONG TITLE
An Act to effect reforms in the rules of law relating to perpetuities; and to
repeal certain provisions of the Conveyancing Act 1919 and the Trustee Act
1925.
Section 1 Name of Act
This Act may be cited as the Perpetuities Act 1984.
Section 2 Commencement
     (1) Sections 1 and 2 shall commence on the date of assent to this
     Act.
     (2) Except as provided by subsection (1), this Act shall commence on
     such day as may be appointed by the Governor in respect thereof and
     as may be notified by proclamation published in the Gazette.
Section 3 Definitions
     (1) In this Act, except in so far as the context or subject-matter
     otherwise indicates or requires:
     "appointed day" means the day appointed and notified under section 2
     (2).
     "disposition" includes:
          (a) the conferring or exercising of a power of appointment
          and any other power or authority to dispose of property,
          and
          (b) any alienation of property.
     "interest" includes any estate and any right.
     "power of appointment" includes any discretionary power to make a
     disposition.
     "property" includes any interest in real or personal property and any
     thing in action.
     "settlement" includes:
          (a) a will,
          (b) an instrument, testamentary or otherwise, exercising a
          power of appointment, whether general or special, and
          (c) any other instrument, transaction or dealing whereby a
          person makes a disposition,
     but does not include an Act of Parliament.
     "the rule against perpetual trusts" means the common law rule that
     invalidates a trust (not otherwise invalid) for a purpose which is
     not charitable where the duration of the trust will or may exceed the
     perpetuity period.
     "trust" and
     "trustee" have the meanings respectively ascribed thereto in the
     Trustee Act 1925.
     "will" includes a codicil.
     (2) For the purposes of this Act, a will shall, in relation to a
     disposition contained in it, be deemed to take effect on the death of
     the testator.
     (3) For the purposes of this Act:
          (a) a person shall be treated as a member of a class if in
          that person's case each and every condition identifying a
          member of the class is satisfied, and
          (b) a person shall be treated as a potential member of a
          class if in that person's case only one or some of the
          conditions identifying a member of the class is or are
          satisfied but there is a possibility that the remainder of
          those conditions will in time be satisfied.
Section 4 Application
     (1) Except as provided by sections 11, 12 and 13, this Act does not
     apply in relation to a settlement taking effect before the appointed
     day.
     (2) This Act applies in relation to a settlement exercising a power
     of appointment, whether general or special, and taking effect on or
     after the appointed day, whether or not it applies in relation to the
     settlement creating the power of appointment.
     (3) This Act does not apply to render invalid, at the outset or at
     some future time, an interest created by a provision of a will
     executed before the appointed day, but taking effect on or after the
     appointed day, if the provision would not have infringed the rule
     against perpetuities had this Act not been enacted and had the will
     taken effect when it was executed.
Section 5 The Crown
     (1) Except as provided by subsection (2) or by any other Act, the
     rule against perpetuities, the rule against perpetual trusts and this
     Act bind the Crown not only in right of New South Wales but also, so
     far as the legislative power of Parliament permits, the Crown in all
     its other capacities.
     (2) Nothing in the rule against perpetuities, in the rule against
     perpetual trusts or in this Act affects any settlement made by the
     Crown.
Section 6 Powers of appointment
     (1) For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, a power of
     appointment shall at any particular time be treated as a special
     power unless, at that time, the appointor has, by the settlement
     creating the power, unconditional authority at his or her own
     discretion to exercise the power by appointing the interest the
     subject of the power to himself or herself.
     (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), an appointment of an interest
     made by will under a power of appointment that would, but for the
     fact that it was made exercisable only by will, have been a general
     power shall be treated as a general power for the purposes of
     determining whether the appointment of the interest infringes the
     rule against perpetuities.
     (3) For the purposes of this section, an authority is unconditional
     notwithstanding any formal condition relating to the mode of exercise
     of the power.
Section 7 The perpetuity period
     (1) For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, the perpetuity
     period applicable to an interest created by a settlement shall be 80
     years from the date on which the settlement takes effect.
     (2) Where an appointment of an interest is made under a special power
     of appointment, the perpetuity period shall be reckoned from the date
     on which the settlement creating the power takes effect.
Section 8 Wait-and-see
     (1) Where a provision of a settlement which creates an interest
     would, but for this section and section 9, infringe the rule against
     perpetuities, the interest shall be treated, until such time (if any)
     as it becomes certain that it must vest, if at all, after the end of
     the perpetuity period, as if the provision did not infringe that
     rule, and its becoming so certain does not affect the validity of any
     thing previously done in relation to the interest.
     (2) Where a provision of a settlement which creates an interest
     consisting of the conferring of a general power of appointment would,
     but for this section and section 9, infringe the rule against
     perpetuities, the interest shall be treated, until such time (if any)
     as it becomes certain that the power will not be exercisable within
     the perpetuity period, as if the provision did not infringe that
     rule.
     (3) Where a provision of a settlement which creates an interest
     consisting of the conferring of any power or right (except a general
     power of appointment) would, but for this section and section 9,
     infringe the rule against perpetuities, the interest shall be treated
     as regards any exercise of the power or right within the perpetuity
     period as if the provision did not infringe that rule, and the
     provisions shall be treated as infringing that rule only if and so
     far as the power or right is not fully exercised within the
     perpetuity period.
     (4) This section does not affect the operation of section 15.
Section 9 Reduction of age and exclusion of class members
     (1) Where:
          (a) a provision of a settlement creates an interest and the
          vesting of the interest depends on the attainment by any
          person of a specified age, and
          (b) it becomes apparent that the provision would, but for
          this subsection, infringe the rule against perpetuities but
          that it would not infringe that rule if the specified age
          had been a lesser age,
     the interest shall, for all purposes, be treated as if, instead of
     its vesting depending on the attainment by the person of the
     specified age, its vesting depended on the attainment by the person
     of the greatest age which, if put in place of the specified age,
     would save the provision from infringing that rule.
     (2) Where an interest to which subsection (1) applies is ulterior to
     any other interest created by the settlement, that other interest
     shall not be defeated or otherwise adversely affected by the
     operation of subsection (1).
     (3) Where, in relation to an interest created by a provision of a
     settlement, different ages are specified in relation to different
     persons:
          (a) the reference in subsection (1) to the specified age
          shall be construed as a reference to all the specified
          ages, and
          (b) subsection (1) shall operate to reduce each such age so
          far as is necessary to save the provision from infringing
          the rule against perpetuities.
     (4) Where a provision of a settlement creates an interest which is to
     be taken by a class of persons and it becomes apparent that the
     inclusion of a person, being a member of the class or an unborn
     person who at birth would become a member or potential member of the
     class, would, but for this subsection:
          (a) cause the provision to infringe the rule against
          perpetuities, or
          (b) prevent subsection (1) from operating to save the
          provision from infringing that rule,
     then, upon its so becoming apparent, the person shall, unless the
     exclusion of the person would exhaust the class, be treated in
     relation to the interest as if the person were not a member of the
     class, and, where subsection (1) applies that subsection shall
     thereupon have effect accordingly.
     (5) Where this section has effect in relation to a provision to which
     section 8 applies, the operation of this section does not affect the
     validity of any thing previously done in relation to the interest
     created by the provision.
Section 10 Order of application of remedial provisions
The following provisions shall, for the purposes of the rule against
perpetuities, be applied in the following order:
     (a) section 8,
     (b) section 9 (1),
     (c) section 9 (4).
Section 11 Administrative powers of trustees
     (1) In this section,
     "administrative power" means a power of a trustee to sell, lease or
     exchange trust property and any other power of a trustee, but does
     not include a power to appoint, pay, transfer, advance, apply,
     distribute or otherwise deal with trust property in or towards
     satisfaction of the interest of a beneficiary under the trust or in
     or towards satisfaction of a purpose of the trust.
     (2) The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate an
     administrative power in relation to trust property during the
     subsistence of a beneficial interest in the trust property.
     (3) This section applies to an administrative power taking effect,
     and to any exercise of an administrative power, before, on or after
     the appointed day.
Section 12 Remuneration of trustees
     (1) The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate a power or
     other provision for remunerating a trustee for the trustee's
     services.
     (2) This section applies to a power or other provision for
     remunerating a trustee taking effect before, on or after the
     appointed day.
Section 13 Superannuation and other funds
     (1) In this section:
     "employees" includes directors, officers, servants and employees of
     any employer.
     "fund" means a provident, superannuation, sick, accident, assurance,
     unemployment, pension or co-operative benefit fund, scheme,
     arrangement or provision or other like fund, scheme, arrangement or
     provision.
     "self-employed persons" includes persons engaged in any lawful
     profession, trade, occupation or calling.
     (2) The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate a fund
     established by a settlement for the benefit of:
          (a) employees,
          (b) self-employed persons,
          (c) spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, dependants
          or legal personal representatives of employees or self-
          employed persons, or
          (d) persons duly selected or nominated for that purpose by
          employees or self-employed persons pursuant to the
          provisions of the settlement.
     (2A) The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate a trust
     established by a settlement and used for investing the assets of a
     fund referred to in subsection (2) (whether or not it is also used
     for investing other assets). This subsection does not affect the
     generality of subsection (2).
     (3) This section applies to settlements taking effect before, on or
     after the appointed day.
Section 14 Determinable interests
     (1) In this section:
     "determinable interest" means an interest created by a settlement,
     being an interest which is, by a provision of the settlement,
     determinable on a contingency.
     "subsequent interest", in relation to a determinable interest created
     by a settlement, means an interest, whether vested or contingent:
          (a) created by the settlement, or remaining undisposed of
          by the settlement, or taking effect by way of reverter,
          resulting trust, residuary gift or otherwise on a
          possibility arising under the settlement, and
          (b) as regards which the determinable interest is a prior
          interest.
     (2) The rule against perpetuities applies to render invalid the
     provision for determination of a determinable interest created by a
     settlement in the same manner as the rule would apply to render
     invalid a condition subsequent in the settlement for defeasance of
     the determinable interest on the same contingency, and where that
     rule does so apply:
          (a) the determinable interest shall not be so determinable,
          and
          (b) a subsequent interest not itself rendered invalid by
          that rule shall be postponed or defeated to the extent
          necessary to allow the determinable interest to have effect
          free from the provision for determination.
     (3) For the purposes of this section, an interest created by, or a
     provision in, an appointment or other exercise of a power in a
     settlement (except a general power of appointment) shall be treated
     as an interest created by, or a provision in, the settlement.
     (4) Notwithstanding subsection (2), the rule against perpetuities
     shall not apply to a gift over from one charity to another.
Section 15 Options
The rule against perpetuities does not apply to:
     (a) any option to renew a lease of property,
     (b) any option to acquire a reversionary interest in property
     comprised in a lease,
     (c) any right of pre-emption given for valuable consideration or by
     will in respect of property, or
     (d) any other option given for valuable consideration or by will to
     acquire an interest in property.
Section 16 Trusts for purposes which are not charitable
     (1) Except as provided by this section, this Act shall not affect the
     operation of the rule against perpetual trusts.
     (2) Where, by a settlement, there is a disposition for a purpose, the
     perpetuity period applicable to the disposition shall, for the
     purposes of the rule against perpetual trusts, be 80 years from the
     date on which the settlement takes effect.
     (3) Where, by a settlement, there is a disposition for a purpose and
     the disposition would, but for this Act, infringe the rule against
     perpetual trusts, the disposition shall be treated, until such time
     (if any) as it becomes certain that the disposition must infringe
     that rule, as if it did not infringe that rule, and its so becoming
     certain does not affect the validity of any thing previously done in
     relation to the disposition.
     (4) This section does not apply to a disposition for a purpose which
     is charitable.
Section 17 Dependent interests
     (1) Where a provision of a settlement creates an interest, the
     provision is not rendered invalid by the rule against perpetuities or
     the rule against perpetual trusts by reason only that the interest is
     ulterior to and dependent upon an interest which is so invalid.
     (2) Where a provision of a settlement creates an interest which is
     ulterior to another interest and the other interest is rendered
     invalid by the rule against perpetuities or the rule against
     perpetual trusts, the acceleration of the vesting of the ulterior
     interest shall not be affected by reason only that the other interest
     is so invalid.
Section 18 Accumulation of income
     (1) Where property is disposed of in such a manner that the income of
     the property may be or is directed to be accumulated wholly or in
     part, the power or direction to accumulate that income is valid if
     the disposition of the accumulated income is, or may be, valid, but
     not otherwise.
     (2) This section does not affect the power of any person to terminate
     an accumulation that is for the person's benefit, or any jurisdiction
     or power of a court to maintain or advance out of accumulations, or
     any power of a trustee under the Trustee Act 1925, or under any other
     Act or law or under any settlement.
Section 19 Repeals
Each Act specified in Column 1 of Schedule 1 is, to the extent specified
opposite that Act in Column 2 of that Schedule, repealed.
Section 20 Savings and transitional provisions
     (1) Section 12 does not affect any rights arising under a judgment or
     an order which has taken effect before the appointed day or arising
     under any agreement made before the appointed day.
     (2) Notwithstanding the repeal of sections 31, 31A and 36 of the
     Conveyancing Act 1919, the provisions of those sections continue to
     apply in relation to a settlement taking effect before the appointed
     day.
