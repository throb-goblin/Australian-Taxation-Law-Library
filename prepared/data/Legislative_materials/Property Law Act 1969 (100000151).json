(3A) A lessor is entitled to recover as a debt due to him from a lessee and in addition to damages (if any), all reasonable costs and expenses properly incurred by the lessor in the employment of a solicitor and surveyor or valuer, or otherwise, in reference to any breach giving rise to a right of re-entry or forfeiture that, at the request of the lessee, is waived by the lessor, or from which the lessee is relieved, under the provisions of this Part either by the Court or by the operation of subsection (1). (3B) The lessor is so entitled to recover whether the lessee has or has not rendered forfeiture unenforceable against him under that subsection. (4) Where a lessor is proceeding by action or otherwise to enforce or has enforced a right of re-entry or forfeiture -- (a) under any covenant, provision or stipulation in a lease; or (b) for non-payment of rent, the Court may, on application by any person claiming as under-lessee any estate or interest in the property comprised in the lease or any part thereof, either in the lessor's action, if any, or in any action brought by that person for that purpose, make an order vesting for the whole term of the lease or any less term, the property comprised in the lease or any part thereof in any person entitled as under-lessee to any estate or interest in the property, upon such conditions, (c) as to execution of any deed or other document; (d) payment of rent, costs, expenses, damages, compensation or giving security or otherwise, as the Court in the circumstances of each case thinks fit, but in no case is the under-lessee entitled to require a lease to be granted to him for any longer term than he had under his original sub-lease. (5) For the purposes of this section except so far as is otherwise provided -- lease includes an original or derivative under-lease; an agreement for a lease where the lessee has become entitled to have his lease granted, and a grant securing a rent by condition; lessee includes an original or derivative under-lessee, and the persons deriving title under a lessee, and a grantee under any grant securing a rent by condition and the persons deriving title under him; lessor includes an original or derivative under-lessor, and the persons deriving title under a lessor, a person making a grant securing a rent by condition and the persons deriving title under him; under-lease includes an agreement for an under-lease where the under-lessee has become entitled to have his under-lease granted; under-lessee includes any person deriving title under an under-lessee. (6) This section applies although the condition or stipulation under which the right of re-entry or forfeiture accrues is inserted in the lease in pursuance of the directions of any Act. (7) For the purposes of this section a lease limited to continue as long only as the lessee abstains from committing a breach of covenant is and takes effect as a lease to continue"
