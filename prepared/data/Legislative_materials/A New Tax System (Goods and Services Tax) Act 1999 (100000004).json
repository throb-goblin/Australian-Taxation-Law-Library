Paragraphs (b) and (c) have effect subject to paragraph (a). Note 1: For example, residential premises will be new residential premises if they are created as described in paragraph (b) or (c) to replace earlier premises that had ceased to be new residential premises because of paragraph (a). Note 2: However, premises that are new residential premises because of paragraph (b) or (c) will cease to be new residential premises once they are sold, or supplied by way of long -term lease, as residential premises (see paragraph (a)). Note 3: Premises created because of the registration of, for example, a strata title plan, or a plan to subdivide land, may not become new residential premises (see subsection (2AA)). (2) However, the *residential premises are not new residential premises if, for the period of at least 5 years since: (a) if paragraph (1)(a) applies (and neither paragraph (1)(b) nor paragraph (1)(c) applies)--the premises first became residential premises; or (b) if paragraph (1)(b) applies--the premises were last *substantially renovated; or (c) if paragraph (1)(c) applies--the premises were last built; the premises have only been used for making supplies that are *input taxed because of paragraph 40-35(1)(a). Subdivisions etc. may not result in new residential premises (2AA) Despite subsection (1), the *residential premises are not new residential premises if: (a) they are created from residential premises that became the subject of a *property subdivision plan; and (b) the residential premises referred to in paragraph (a) were not new residential premises immediately before they became the subject of that plan. This subsection has effect subject to paragraphs (1)(b) and (c). Disregard certain supplies of the premises (2A) A supply of the *residential premises is disregarded as a sale or supply for the purposes of applying paragraph (1)(a): (a) if it is a supply by a member of a *GST group to another member of the GST group; or (b) if: (i) it is a supply by the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture to another entity that is a *participant in the joint venture; and (ii) the other entity acquired the interest, unit or lease for consumption, use or supply in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into. (2B) A supply (the wholesale supply) of the *residential premises is disregarded as a sale or supply for the purposes of applying paragraph (1)(a) if: (a) the premises from which the residential premises were created had earlier been supplied to the *recipient of the wholesale supply or one or more of its *associates; and (b) an arrangement (including an agreement) was made by: (i) the supplier of the earlier supply, or one or more associates of the supplier; and (ii) the recipient of the earlier supply, or one or more associates of the recipient; and (c) under the arrangement, the wholesale supply was conditional on: (i) specified building or renovation work being undertaken by the recipient of the earlier supply, or by one or more associates of the recipient; or (ii) circumstances existing as specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph. Note 1: The premises referred to in paragraph (a) could be vacant land. Note 2: For subparagraph (c)(ii), circumstances may be specified by class (see subsection 13(3) of the Legislation Act 2003). Note 3: This subsection does not apply to a supply if certain commercial commitments were in place before 27 January 2011 (see item 12 of Schedule 4 to the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Act 2012). (2C) A supply of the *residential premises is disregarded as a sale or supply for the purposes of applying paragraph (1)(a) if it is made because a *property subdivision plan relating to the premises was lodged for registration (however described) by the *recipient of the supply or the recipient&#39;s *associate. Note: This subsection does not apply to a supply if the plan was lodged for registration before 27 January 2011 (see item 13 of Schedule 4 to the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Act 2012).

(8) Subsection (6) or (7) applies to an acquisition through a supply made by: (a) a *GST branch; or (b) a*non-profit sub-entity; or (c) a *government entity of a kind referred to in section 72-95 or 72-100; as if Subdivision 72-D affected the operation of that subsection in the same way that it affects the operation of Division 72."

Accordingly, this compilation does not show the text of the compiled law as modified. Any modifications affecting the law are accessible on the Register.

Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.

If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.

Accordingly, this compilation does not show the text of the compiled law as modified. Any modifications affecting the law are accessible on the Register.

Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.
