Section 3H Partners taken to have beneficial ownership of individual partnership property
     (1)     For the purposes of this Act, a partner in
a partnership is taken to have beneficial ownership of each item of
partnership property in the same proportion as the partner's partnership
interest.
S. 3H(1A) inserted by
No. 47/2020 s. 4.
     (1A)     Without limiting subsection (1), if the partnership property of
a partnership ("first partnership") includes an interest in another
partnership, whether directly or indirectly through one or more other
partnerships, a partner in the first partnership is also taken to have
beneficial ownership of each item of the partnership property of each other
partnership&#8212;
         (a)     to the extent of the direct or indirect interest in the other
partnership; and
         (b)     in the same proportion as the partner's partnership interest in the
first partnership.
     (2)     The value of the partner's beneficial ownership of an item of
partnership property must be determined without regard to any liabilities of the
partnership.
Example
A partnership consists of 4 partners each of whom has contributed
equally to the capital of the partnership and would be entitled to a 25% share
of any surplus on dissolution of the partnership in respect of capital. The
sole partnership property is land with an unencumbered value of $4 million.
The registered proprietor of the land is a person who holds the land
as custodian for the benefit of the partnership. The liabilities of the
partnership are $3 million. Under this section, each partner is taken
to have 25% beneficial ownership of the land without regard to any
liabilities of the partnership. For example, if a partner left the
partnership and another partner joined the partnership on the same terms, there
would be a change of beneficial ownership in the land to the value of $1
million.
     (3)     To avoid doubt, for the purposes of section 75, partnership
property is taken to be held by the partnership for the benefit of each partner
in the same proportion as the partner's beneficial ownership referred to in
subsection (1).
     (4)     To avoid doubt, for the purposes of Part 2 of Chapter 11, if
partnership property consists of or includes shares or units, a partner is taken
to have the ability to cast, or to control the casting of, the votes attaching
to the shares or units of which the partner is taken to have beneficial
ownership under subsection (1).
     (5)     In this section&#8212;
"partnership interest", of a partner, means the proportion of
any surplus to which the partner would be entitled in respect of capital if the
partnership were to be dissolved;
"partnership property" has the same meaning as in section 24(1)
of the Partnership Act 1958.

Section 3J Application of this Act to corporate collective investment vehicles
     (1)     For the purposes of this Act, each
sub-fund of a CCIV is taken to be a unit trust scheme of which&#8212;
         (a)     the CCIV is the trustee; and
         (b)     the business, assets and liabilities of the sub&#8209;fund are the
trust property; and
         (c)     the members of the sub-fund are the beneficiaries.
Example
A CCIV has 2 sub-funds: sub-fund A and sub-fund B. The assets of sub-fund B
include land with an unencumbered value of $5 million. Each sub-fund is taken to
be a separate unit trust scheme. In the case of sub-fund B&#8212;
               &#8226     the CCIV is the trustee; and
               &#8226     the land is the trust property; and
               &#8226     the members of the sub-fund are the beneficiaries of the unit trust
scheme.
     (2)     For a sub-fund that is taken to be a unit trust scheme under
subsection (1)&#8212;
         (a)     a share in the CCIV that is referable to that sub-fund is taken to be
a unit in the unit trust scheme; and
         (b)     a shareholder of that share, as a member of that sub-fund, is
taken to be a registered unitholder of the unit in the unit trust scheme;
and
         (c)     any rights, entitlements, obligations and other characteristics
attaching to that share are taken, as far as practicable, to be the same rights,
entitlements, obligations and other characteristics attaching to the unit;
and
         (d)     a winding up of the sub-fund is taken to be a winding up of the unit
trust scheme; and
         (e)     a person who has an entitlement, whether directly or through another
person, to a distribution of property on the winding up of the sub-fund is taken
to have the same entitlement to a distribution of property on the winding up of
the unit trust scheme.
Examples
Section 1 A CCIV has one sub-fund: sub-fund C. The shares that are referable to
sub-fund C entitle the shareholders to a distribution of property on the winding
up of the sub&#8209;fund. Sub-fund C is taken to be a unit trust scheme for
which&#8212;
               &#8226     a share that is referable to the sub-fund is taken to be a unit in
the unit trust scheme; and
               &#8226     a shareholder of that share is taken to be a unitholder of the unit
in the unit trust scheme; and
               &#8226     the entitlement of that shareholder to a distribution of property
on the winding up of the sub-fund is taken to be the entitlement of a unitholder
to a distribution of property on the winding up of the unit trust
scheme.
Section 2 A CCIV has 2 sub-funds: sub-fund D and sub&#8209;fund E. The assets of
sub-fund E include land with an unencumbered value of $10 million. Each sub-fund
is taken to be a separate unit trust scheme. The unit trust scheme that is
sub-fund E is a landholder for the purposes of Part 2 of Chapter 3. The CCIV, in
respect of sub-fund D, then acquires 100% of the shares referable to sub-fund E.
That acquisition is a relevant acquisition within the meaning given by
section 78. In accordance with section 75, the unit trust scheme that is
sub-fund E is then a linked entity of the unit trust scheme that is
sub&#8209;fund D.
     (3)     For the purposes of this Act, a CCIV is taken to be a separate person
in relation to each unit trust scheme of which it is the trustee under
subsection (1).
     (4)     This Act does not apply to a CCIV or the members of a sub-fund of a
CCIV except as provided in this section.

market&#8212;
         (a)     in the case of a transfer of dutiable property on a sale of the
property&#8212;at the time the contract of sale was entered into;
         (b)     in any other case&#8212;at the time the dutiable transaction
occurred&#8212;
free from any encumbrance to which the property was subject at that
time.
     (2)     In determining the amount for which land or goods might reasonably
have been sold free from encumbrances, there must be disregarded subject to
subsection (3), any interest, agreement or arrangement (other than an
encumbrance) granted or made in respect of the land or goods, that has the
effect of reducing the value of the land or goods.

     (2A)     A reference in subsection (2) to an interest includes a reference to
an equitable interest that&#8212;
         (a)     was created before the time of the transfer of the land or goods;
and
         (b)     is in existence at that time.
     (3)     An interest, agreement or arrangement referred to in subsection (2) is
not to be disregarded if the Commissioner is satisfied that it was not granted
or made as a part of an arrangement or scheme with a collateral purpose of
reducing the duty otherwise payable on the transfer of the land or
goods.
     (4)     In considering whether or not he or she is satisfied for the purposes
of subsection (3), the Commissioner may have regard to&#8212;
         (a)     the duration of the interest, agreement or arrangement before the
transfer; and
         (b)     whether the interest, agreement or arrangement has been granted to or
made with an associate, a related corporation or a trustee of the transferor or
transferee; and

of the marketable securities in the event of the company being voluntarily wound
up at the time the dutiable transaction occurred, whether or not any such
winding up was intended or contemplated at that time.

land is to be included in that value.
     (2)     However, the value of tenant's fixtures is not to be included if the
Commissioner is satisfied that the fixtures are not sold or transferred to the
purchaser, the transferee of the land or an associated person of the purchaser
or the transferee of the land.

(the goods transferee) under a contract of sale of goods, or a
contract of sale of a business; and
         (c)     the land transferee and the goods transferee are not associated
persons; and
         (d)     the Commissioner is satisfied that the contract of sale referred to in
paragraph (a) and the contract of sale referred to in paragraph (b) are not
substantially one transaction; and
         (e)     at least one of the contracts of sale referred to in paragraph (a) and
        (b) is conditional on the other.
     (2)     If this section applies&#8212;
         (a)     in determining the unencumbered value of the land transferred to the
land transferee, the value of the business goods is to be disregarded;
         (b)     nothing in section 24 applies to the transfer.
     (3)     However, if at any subsequent time the business goods or any of them
are transferred to the land transferee or to an associated person of the land
transferee, the value of the business goods transferred is deemed to have formed
part of the value of the land and duty payable under this Part is to be assessed
or reassessed on that basis.
S. 22B(4) amended by
No. 69/2011 s. 8.
     (4)     Any duty payable because of the operation of subsection (3) is payable
within 30 days after the date on which the business goods were transferred

that&#8212;
         (a)     the land transferee acquired the business goods at least 3 years after
acquiring the land; and
         (b)     the acquisition of the business goods by the land transferee at a
subsequent time was not contemplated at the time of the contract of sale of the
land.

carried on or in connection with land, other than goods referred to in section
10(1)(d)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v).
Section 23 Arrangements that reduce the dutiable value of marketable securities
     (1)     In computing for the purposes of this
Chapter the unencumbered value of any marketable securities of a company, the
Commissioner may include the value of any assets formerly owned or controlled by
the company if&#8212;
         (a)     those assets were transferred to the ownership or control of the
transferee of the marketable securities or to an associated person of the
transferee before the transfer of the marketable securities; and
         (b)     those assets are necessary for the continuing operation of the company
after the transfer of the marketable securities; and
         (c)     the value of the marketable securities was reduced following the
transfer of ownership or control of assets because the proceeds of that transfer
were not retained by the company.
     (2)     In determining whether assets are necessary for the continuing
operation of a company the Commissioner may take into account&#8212;
         (a)     whether or not the assets were removed from the company's premises
after the transfer of ownership or control;
         (b)     whether or not the assets continued to be used by the company under an
arrangement with the transferee.
     (3)     This section does not apply if the Commissioner is satisfied that the
transfer of ownership or control of assets&#8212;
         (a)     was part of the normal business operations of the transferee;
or
         (b)     was not part of a scheme or arrangement devised for the principal
purpose of minimising duty chargeable under this Chapter on the transfer of
marketable securities.

Section 24A Dutiable transactions relating to vacant land and construction of residential premises&#8212;where not constructed
     (1)     Dutiable transactions in respect of vacant
land that would have been aggregated under section 24(1) but were not aggregated
because of section 24(2) are chargeable with duty in accordance with this
section if any of the following occurs in respect of the land&#8212;
         (a)     another dutiable transaction occurs in respect of the vacant land and
at the time that the other dutiable transaction occurs no residential premises
that are ready for occupation as a place of residence have been constructed on
the land by the transferee;
         (b)     premises other than residential premises have been constructed on the
vacant land and those premises are ready for occupation or use for the purposes
for which they were constructed;
         (c)     the transferee has not constructed residential premises on the vacant
land that are ready for occupation as a place of residence within 5 years after
the date on which the land was transferred to the transferee.
     (2)     If duty is chargeable under subsection (1), the Commissioner may
reassess duty on the transactions.
     (3)     The duty chargeable under this section is calculated as
follows&#8212;
         (a)     firstly, aggregate the dutiable transactions that would have been
aggregated under section 24(1) but were not aggregated because of section 24(2),
as if the dutiable value of each dutiable transaction is the same as it was at
the time of the dutiable transaction; and
         (b)     secondly, calculate the duty that would be payable on the dutiable
value of the aggregated dutiable property; and
         (c)     thirdly, apportion the amount of duty that would be payable on the
aggregated dutiable property to each dutiable transaction that would have been
aggregated but was not; and
         (d)     the amount of duty payable for each dutiable transaction that is
chargeable with duty under subsection (1) is the amount apportioned to it under
paragraph (c), less an allowance for any duty already paid in respect of that
transaction.
Example
On 1 September 2012, a builder acquires 10 lots of vacant land by
completing 10 dutiable transactions.  The value of each dutiable transaction is
$100 000.  The transactions would have been aggregated under
section 24(1) and duty would have been calculated on an aggregated amount
of $1 000 000.  However, the builder intends to construct residential
premises on each lot of vacant land.  Section 24(2) applies and the transactions
are not aggregated and duty is calculated on each transaction
separately.
On 1 September 2015, the builder on-sells two of the lots without
building residential premises on them.  Duty is calculated in the following way.
The 10 dutiable transactions are aggregated based on the dutiable
value of the dutiable transactions at the time they occurred (10 lots x
$100 000 = $1 000 000).  The duty that would be payable on the
dutiable value of the aggregated property is then apportioned to each dutiable
transaction.  The builder is re&#8209;assessed for duty in respect of each lot
the builder on&#8209;sold, less an allowance for each lot for the duty
previously paid on it.  The builder must pay the difference in respect of each
on-sold lot.
     (4)     A liability for duty charged under this section
arises&#8212;
         (a)     in the case of subsection (1)(a)&#8212;when the other dutiable
transaction occurs;
         (b)     in the case of subsection (1)(b)&#8212;when the premises are ready for
occupation or use for the purposes for which they were constructed;
         (c)     in the case of subsection (1)(c)&#8212;5 years after the date on
which the land was transferred to the transferee.
     (5)     A reassessment referred to in subsection (2) is authorised if more
than 5 years have passed since the initial assessment was made.
Note
Section 9(3) of the Taxation Administration Act 1997 allows a
reassessment to be made more than 5 years after the initial assessment if
this is authorised by a taxation law.
     (6)     If dutiable transactions would have been aggregated under section
24(1) but were not aggregated because of the operation of section 24(2), the
transferee must lodge written notice with the Commissioner within 30 days after
becoming aware that any of the circumstances set out in subsection (1) have
occurred in respect of any of those transactions.
     (7)     A failure of a transferee to comply with subsection (6) does not
affect the Commissioner's power to reassess duty under this section.
Section 25 Apportionment&#8212;dutiable property and other property
     (1)     If a dutiable transaction relates to
dutiable property and property that is not dutiable property, it is chargeable
with duty under this Chapter only to the extent that it relates to dutiable
property.
     (2)     If a dutiable transaction relates to different types of dutiable
property for which different rates of duty are chargeable under this Chapter,
the dutiable transaction is chargeable with duty under this Chapter as if a
separate dutiable transaction had occurred in relation to each such type of
dutiable property.
Section 26 Partitions of marketable securities
In determining the duty to be paid on any
dutiable transaction that gives effect to a partition or division of any
marketable securities the Commissioner must, before assessing the duty
(if any) payable on the transaction, deduct from the value of those
marketable securities the value of the beneficial interest in those marketable
securities held prior to the transaction by the transferee.
S. 27 amended by No. 26/2015
s. 19 (ILA s. 39B(1)).
Section 27 Partitions of land
     (1)     In determining the duty to be paid on any
dutiable transaction that gives effect to a partition or division of any estate
in land, the Commissioner must, before assessing the duty (if any) payable on
the transaction, deduct from the value of that estate the value of the
beneficial interest in that estate held prior to the transaction by the
transferee.

         (b)     the dutiable value of the subsequent transaction by which the final
subsequent purchaser obtained or assumed the transfer right; and
         (c)     if there were any other subsequent transactions, the dutiable value of
each of those transactions.
     (2)     Duty is charged at the rate set out in Part 3 on the dutiable
values referred to in subsection (1).
     (3)     Despite subsection (1), duty is not charged under this Division
on the dutiable value of a subsequent transaction referred to in
subsection (1)(b) or (c) (as the case requires) if duty is charged on the
subsequent transaction under Division 2 or 3.

transaction&#8212;
         (a)     if a person obtains a transfer right under a latter transaction
that is greater than a transfer right the person obtained under the initial
transaction&#8212;to the extent of the transfer right obtained by the person
under the initial transaction; and
         (b)     if a person obtains a transfer right under a latter transaction that
is less than a transfer right the person obtained under the initial
transaction&#8212;to the extent of the transfer right obtained by the person
under the latter transaction.
Example
A vendor grants an option that entitles persons A and B
to require the vendor to enter into a contract of sale of
dutiable property (the initial transaction). Under the
option, persons A and B each obtain a transfer right to a 50% interest in
the property. Under a subsequent transaction immediately following the
granting of the option (a latter transaction), person A
obtains a transfer right in respect of a 100% interest in the
property. Duty is not charged under subsection (1)(a) in respect of
the option to the extent of the transfer right obtained by person A
under the initial transaction (50%).

transaction;
"latter transaction" means a subsequent transaction immediately

               (ii)     the Commissioner is satisfied that a real purchaser has provided or

Example
Person A and Person B purchase an estate in fee simple together,
making equal contributions to the purchase price. They intend to be registered
as tenants in common in equal shares. However, only Person A is registered.
As a result, Person A holds 50% of the estate in fee simple as an apparent
purchaser on trust for Person B, the real purchaser of that 50%.
Person A transfers the whole of the estate in fee simple to
Person B. Under this transfer, 50% represents Person B's beneficial
interest in the property held by Person A and the other 50% is purchased by
Person B. Although the transfer is for the whole of the estate in fee
simple, no duty is chargeable in respect of the 50% that was held on trust by
Person A as apparent purchaser for Person B, the real
purchaser.

S. 69AF(1)(b) amended by
No. 22/2018 s. 16(1).
         (b)     the young farmer or young farmer business entity (as the case
requires) is entitled to an exemption from duty in respect of $600 000 of the
aggregated dutiable value of the dutiable transactions; and
         (c)     once paragraph (b) has applied, the duty payable on the dutiable
transactions is calculated&#8212;
               (i)     in accordance with section 24; and
               (ii)     as if the dutiable values of the dutiable transactions do not include
any amount in respect of which an exemption has been applied under paragraph
        (b).
     (2)     The exemption from duty under subsection (1)(c) is applied
against the dutiable values of the dutiable transactions in the order of
ascending dutiable values of the dutiable transactions.
Example to S. 69AF(2) substituted by
No. 22/2018 s. 16(2).
Example
A young farmer enters into 3 dutiable transactions with dutiable values of
$200 000 (Transaction A), $300 000 (Transaction B) and $500 000 (Transaction C).
An exemption in respect of $600 000 of the aggregated dutiable value of the
dutiable transactions is first applied to the dutiable transaction with the
lowest dutiable value, and then to the dutiable transaction with the next lowest
dutiable value. This means that a full exemption from duty applies to
Transaction A and Transaction B, with a partial exemption applied to Transaction
C in respect of $100 000 of its dutiable value.

reform scheme land is a lot (a child lot) in a registered plan of
subdivision of tax reform scheme land (the parent
lot)&#8212;
         (a)     the child lot is taken to have an entry interest of the same quantum
as the entry interest for the parent lot; and
         (b)     if a further interest was acquired in the parent lot, the child lot is
taken to have been the subject of the acquisition of a further interest of the
same quantum as the further interest in the parent lot; and
         (c)     the entry interest and any further interest in the child lot is
taken&#8212;
               (i)     to have been subject to the same duty consequences as the entry
interest or further interest in the parent lot; and
               (ii)     to otherwise have the same characteristics, as far as practicable, as
the entry interest or further interest in the parent lot.

Examples
Section 1. Person A acquires a 100% interest in land under a transfer of land. This
is a qualifying interest in the land and the dutiable transaction is an entry
transaction. Person A registers a plan of subdivision to subdivide the land (the
parent lot) into 4 lots (the child lots). Person B
acquires the child lots under 4 transfers of land. No duty is chargeable on
these tax reform scheme transactions under section 69AP on the basis that
the entry interest for each child lot is taken to be a 100% interest.
Section 2. Person A acquires a 50% interest in land under a transfer of
land which occurs on 1 January 2026. This is a qualifying interest in the
land and the dutiable transaction is an entry transaction. Person B is
the beneficial owner of the remaining 50% interest in the land.
Person A and Person B register a plan of subdivision to subdivide the
land (the parent lot) into 2 lots (the child
lots). On 1 July 2027, Person C purchases a 50% interest
in each child lot from Person B. Duty is chargeable on
these tax reform scheme transactions as the entry interest for each
child lot is taken to have the same quantum (50%), characteristics (acquired by
Person A) and duty consequences as the entry interest for the parent lot, and
the interest acquired by Person C is not the same, nor substantially the
same, as the entry interest for each child lot.

Section 80 How may an interest be acquired?
     (1)     A person acquires an interest in a landholder if the person obtains an
interest beneficially, including if the person's interest increases, in the
landholder, regardless of how it is obtained or increased.
     (2)     Without limiting subsection (1), a person may acquire an interest in a
landholder in the following ways&#8212;
         (a)     the purchase, gift, allotment or issue of a unit or share;
         (b)     the cancellation, redemption or surrender of a unit or
share;
         (c)     the abrogation or alteration of a right pertaining to a unit or
share;
         (d)     the payment of an amount owing for a unit or share.
     (3)     Without limiting subsection (1), a person is taken to obtain an
interest beneficially if the person obtains the interest as trustee of a
trust.
     (4)     A trustee who holds or acquires an interest in a landholder is to be
treated as a separate person in respect of each trust of which the trustee is a
trustee and the personal capacity of the trustee, if any.
     (5)     In addition to subsection (1), a person who holds an interest in a
landholder acquires an interest in the landholder if the capacity in which the
person holds the interest changes.
     (6)     An acquisition of an interest referred to in subsection (5) is to be
treated as a separate acquisition from existing interests held by the acquirer
or any other acquisition of an interest in a landholder unless those
acquisitions are made on behalf of the same person or associated
persons.
     (7)     For the avoidance of doubt, an acquisition by way of transfer of units
or shares is not necessary to acquire an interest in a landholder.

         (a)     re-acquired by the person from whom it was acquired; or
         (b)     in the case of an acquisition by way of mortgage, conveyed by the
mortgagee to a third person in exercise of the mortgagee's power of sale, within
that period (or that longer period).
     (4)     The re-acquisition by a person of the interest or economic entitlement
concerned is not a relevant acquisition for the purposes of this Part.

Section 89FA Value of certain tax reform scheme land holdings to be excluded from duty assessment
S. 89FA(1)
substituted by No. 50/2024 s. 10(2).
     (1)     This section applies if&#8212;
         (a)     a relevant acquisition is made in a landholder; and
         (b)     the land holdings of the landholder are comprised wholly or partly of
an interest or estate in tax reform scheme land, other than a lease of a kind
referred to in section 7(1)(b)(v) or (va); and
         (c)     on the date of the relevant acquisition, the tax reform scheme land
has a qualifying use.
     (2)     The unencumbered value of land referred to in subsection (1) is
to be excluded from any calculation under section 86 or 87 of the duty
chargeable on the relevant acquisition if&#8212;
S. 89FA(2)(a) substituted by
No. 50/2024 s. 10(3).
         (a)     a period of at least 3 years has elapsed between the entry date for
the tax reform scheme land and the date on which a contract or other agreement
or arrangement for the relevant acquisition is entered into; or
         (b)     the entry interest for the land was a 100% interest; or
         (c)     the entry interest and any further interest acquired before the
relevant acquisition amounts to a 100% interest.
     (3)     The unencumbered value of land referred to in subsection (1) is
to be excluded from any calculation under section 86 or 87 of the duty
chargeable on the relevant acquisition to the extent that the interest a person
is taken to have obtained in the land under the relevant acquisition is the same
or substantially the same as either or both of the following&#8212;
         (a)     the entry interest for the land;
S. 89FA(3)(b) amended by
No. 24/2025 s. 12.
         (b)     any further interest a person is taken to have obtained in the land
before the relevant acquisition.
     (4)     The Commissioner may treat the interest a person is taken to have
obtained in land under a relevant acquisition as the same or substantially the
same as an interest described in subsection (3) if the Commissioner is
satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances.
Example
Person A acquires a 50% interest in a landholder under a relevant
acquisition which occurs on 1 September 2025.  The landholder holds a 100%
interest in land.  This relevant acquisition amounts to an interest of 50% in
the land which is a qualifying interest and the qualifying landholder
transaction is an entry transaction.  Person B holds the remaining 50% interest
in the landholder.  On 1 January 2026, Person C acquires a 100% interest in
the landholder from Person A and Person B.  The value of the land holding of the
landholder is to be excluded from the calculation of duty to the extent that the
interest acquired by Person C is the same, or substantially the same, as the
entry interest for the land (50%).  The value of 50% of the land is
included for the purposes of assessing duty on the relevant acquisition made by
Person C.
     (5)     In this section, the interest a person is taken to have obtained in
land under a relevant acquisition is the interest the person acquires in the
landholder under the relevant acquisition, and on which duty would otherwise be
chargeable, multiplied by the interest the landholder holds in the land at the
time the relevant acquisition is made.
     (6)     In this section, a "further interest" in land means an
interest that is&#8212;
         (a)     obtained under a qualifying dutiable transaction or a qualifying
landholder transaction, other than the relevant entry transaction for the land;
and
         (b)     a different interest to the entry interest for the land and any other
further interest obtained in the land.

         (b)     the land holdings of the landholder are comprised wholly or partly
of&#8212;
               (i)     a lease of a kind referred to in section 7(1)(b)(v) or (va) over tax
reform scheme land; or
               (ii)     an interest in dutiable property referred to in
section 10(1)(ad) located on tax reform scheme land; or
               (iii)     an interest in tax reform scheme land that is taken to be
beneficially owned under section 32XD; and
         (c)     on the date of the relevant acquisition, the tax reform scheme land
has a qualifying use.
     (2)     The unencumbered value of a land holding referred to in
subsection (1)(b) is to be excluded from the calculation under
section 86 or 87 of the duty chargeable on the relevant acquisition
if&#8212;
         (a)     any of the following applies&#8212;
               (i)     a period of at least 3 years has elapsed between the entry date for
the tax reform scheme land and the date on which a contract or other agreement
or arrangement for the relevant acquisition is entered into; or
               (ii)     the entry interest for the tax reform scheme land was a 100%
interest; or
               (iii)     the entry interest and any further interest acquired in the tax
reform scheme land before the relevant acquisition amounts to a 100% interest;
and
         (b)     the value of the tax reform scheme land, for the purposes of
calculating the duty payable on the entry transaction and on the acquisition of
any further interest referred to in paragraph (a)(iii)&#8212;
               (i)     was not reduced by a lease over the land or part of the land;
and
               (ii)     did not exclude the value of an interest in dutiable property
referred to in section 10(1)(ad) located on the land; and
               (iii)     was not reduced by an economic entitlement in relation to the
land.
     (3)     The Commissioner may exclude or partially exclude the unencumbered
value of a land holding referred to in subsection (1)(b) that is not
excluded under subsection (2) from the calculation under section 86 or 87
of the duty chargeable on the relevant acquisition if the Commissioner, having
regard to the matters in subsection (4), is satisfied that it is appropriate to
do so.
     (4)     For the purposes of subsection (3), the Commissioner must have
regard to&#8212;
         (a)     the quantum of the entry interest and any further interests acquired
in the tax reform scheme land; and
         (b)     the extent to which the value of the tax reform scheme land, for the
purposes of calculating the duty payable on the entry transaction and on the
acquisition of any further interests in the land&#8212;
               (i)     was reduced by a lease over the land or part of the land;
and
               (ii)     excluded the value of an interest in fixtures referred to in
section 10(1)(ad) located on the land; and
               (iii)     was reduced by an economic entitlement in relation to the land;
and
         (c)     if a specified transaction occurred on or after 1 July 2024
but before the entry transaction for the land, the period of time that elapsed
between the specified transaction and the entry transaction occurring;
and
         (d)     if a specified transaction occurred after the entry transaction for
the land but before the relevant acquisition that is being assessed, the duty
that was paid on the specified transaction; and
         (e)     any other matter that the Commissioner considers relevant.
     (5)     Subsections (4), (5) and (6) of section 89FA apply to this section
with any necessary modifications.
     (6)     In this section, specified transaction has the same
meaning as it has in section 69AQA.

Section 89FAC Application of Division to subdivided tax reform scheme land
     (1)     For the purposes of this Division, if the
land holdings of a landholder include tax reform scheme land that is a lot (a
child lot) in a registered plan of subdivision of tax reform
scheme land (the "parent lot")&#8212;
         (a)     the child lot is taken to have an entry interest of the same quantum
as the entry interest for the parent lot; and
         (b)     if a further interest was acquired in the parent lot, the child lot is
taken to have been the subject of the acquisition of a further interest of the
same quantum as the further interest in the parent lot; and
         (c)     the entry interest and any further interest in the child lot is
taken&#8212;
               (i)     to have been subject to the same duty consequences as the entry
interest or further interest in the parent lot; and
               (ii)     to otherwise have the same characteristics, as far as practicable, as
the entry interest or further interest in the parent lot.
     (2)     In this section&#8212;

S. 89FB(1)(a) substituted by
No. 50/2024 s. 12(a).
         (a)     when the relevant acquisition was made, the land holdings of the

a kind referred to in section 7(1)(b)(v) or (va) over tax reform scheme
land; or
               (ii)     an interest in dutiable property referred to in
section 10(1)(ad) located on tax reform scheme land; or
               (iii)     an interest in tax reform scheme land that is taken to be

S. 89FB(1)(b) amended by
No. 50/2024 s. 12(b).
         (b)     the value or part of the value of the land holdings referred to in
paragraph (a) was excluded under section 89FA or 89FAB from the
calculation of duty payable on the relevant acquisition; and

No. 50/2024 s. 12(c).
         (c)     after the relevant acquisition was made, the tax reform scheme land

No. 50/2024 s. 12(d).
         (e)     at the time of the change of use, the land holdings of the landholder
include the land holding referred to in paragraph (a)(i), (ii) or (iii) (as the
case requires); and

acquisition continues to hold an interest in the landholder.
     (2)     Duty is payable on the relevant acquisition to the extent that the
interest that a person is taken to have obtained in land under the relevant
acquisition is the same as the interest the person is taken to hold in the land
at the time of the change of use.
     (3)     For the purposes of subsection (2)&#8212;
         (a)     the interest a person is taken to have obtained in land under a
relevant acquisition is determined in accordance with section 89FA(5);
and
         (b)     the interest a person is taken to hold in land at the time of the
change of use is the interest the person holds in the landholder multiplied by
the interest the landholder holds in the land at that time.
     (4)     The amount of duty calculated under subsection (1) is to be
reduced by 10% for each calendar year that has elapsed since the date of the
relevant acquisition that is being assessed for duty.
     (5)     A liability for duty imposed under this section arises on the date of
the change of use.

calculation of duty imposed on a relevant acquisition under section 89FB if a
plan of subdivision of land is registered in respect of the land referred to in
that section (the parent lot) before the date of the change of use
of the land.
     (2)     The duty chargeable on the relevant acquisition under section 89FB, to
the extent that it relates to the subdivided land, is to be apportioned to each
lot that has had a change of use by reference to the area that lot bears to the

4&#8212;Valuation and supplementary calculation provisions
S. 89G substituted by
No. 38/2012 s. 5.
Section 89G Valuation of land holdings
     (1)     The provisions of this Act for
ascertaining the value of transfers chargeable with ad valorem duty apply
in the same way to a relevant acquisition under this Part and the value of land
holdings to which the relevant acquisition relates.
     (2)     In determining the value of land holdings under this Part, any
arrangement made in respect of the land holdings that has the effect of reducing
the value is to be disregarded, subject to subsection (3).
     (3)     An arrangement is not to be disregarded if the Commissioner is
satisfied that the arrangement was not made as part of an arrangement or scheme
with a collateral purpose of reducing the duty otherwise payable in relation to
the relevant acquisition.
     (4)     In considering whether or not he or she is satisfied for the purposes
of subsection (3), the Commissioner may have regard to&#8212;
         (a)     the duration of the arrangement before the relevant acquisition;
and
         (b)     whether the arrangement has been made with an associated person;
and
         (c)     whether there is any commercial efficacy to the making of the
arrangement other than to reduce duty; and
         (d)     any other matters the Commissioner considers relevant.
S. 89H substituted by
No. 38/2012 s. 5.
Section 89H Maximisation of entitlements on distribution of land holdings
     (1)     This section applies to any calculation,
for the purposes of this Part, of the entitlement of a person (the
interested person) to participate in a distribution of the
property of a landholder, whether on a winding up, a vesting of trust property
or otherwise.
     (2)     A calculation is to be made based, firstly, on a distribution carried
out in accordance with the constitution of the landholder, and with any law
relevant to the distribution, as in force at the time of distribution, and the
entitlement of the interested person is to be evaluated accordingly.
     (3)     Next, a calculation is to be made based on a distribution carried out
after the interested person, and any other person whom the interested person has
power to direct with respect to such a distribution or who is, in relation to
the interested person, an associated person, has exercised all powers and
discretions exercisable by them&#8212;
         (a)     to effect or compel an alteration to the constitution of the
landholder; and
         (b)     to vary the rights conferred by units or shares in the landholder;
and
         (c)     to effect or compel the substitution or replacement of units or shares
in the landholder with other units or shares in it&#8212;
in such a manner as would maximise the value of the entitlement, and the
entitlement of the interested person is to be evaluated accordingly.
     (4)     The results obtained by an evaluation of the interested person's
entitlement in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) are then to be compared,
and whichever evaluation results in a greater entitlement is the correct
evaluation, for the purposes of this Part, of the entitlement, unless the
Commissioner, being satisfied that the application of this subsection in the
particular case would be inequitable, determines otherwise.
     (5)     A reference in this section to the constitution of a landholder is a
reference, if the landholder is a unit trust scheme, to the trust deed or other
document that contains the rules of the trust.

landholder that necessitates the lodgement of an acquisition statement under
Division 2, the landholder was the vendor under an uncompleted agreement for the
sale or transfer of land; and
         (b)     the agreement is subsequently completed&#8212;
the Commissioner is to determine whether or not duty is payable, and must
assess or reassess the statement accordingly, as though the land the subject of
the agreement was not, at the time of the acquisition concerned, a land holding
of the landholder.
     (2)     If&#8212;
         (a)     at the time of acquisition of an interest by any person in a
landholder that requires the lodgement by any person of an acquisition statement
under Division 2, the landholder was the purchaser under an uncompleted
agreement for the sale or transfer of land; and
         (b)     the agreement is subsequently rescinded, annulled or otherwise
terminated without completion&#8212;
the Commissioner is to determine whether or not duty is payable, and must
assess or reassess the statement accordingly, as though the land the subject of
the agreement was not, at the time of the acquisition concerned, a land holding
of the landholder.
     (3)     In this section, a reference to a "landholder "includes a
reference to a linked entity of the landholder and, in the case of a landholder
that is a unit trust scheme, also includes a reference to a trustee of the
landholder.
     (4)     For the purposes of this section&#8212;
         (a)     a reference to a vendor includes a reference to a person who, at the
time of a relevant acquisition, was the grantee of a put option or grantor of a
call option;

or
               (ii)     was the grantor of a put option or grantee of a call
option;

     (1)     This section applies if&#8212;
         (a)     the trustee of a unit trust scheme that is a widely held trust redeems
any units in the trust; and
         (b)     as a result of the redemption, the scheme would, but for this section,
cease to be a widely held trust because a unit holder, individually or together
with any associated person, is beneficially entitled to more than 20% of the
units in the trust.
     (2)     For a period of 30 days beginning on and including the day on which
the redemption occurs, the definition of widely held trust in
section 3(1) applies to the unit trust scheme as if a reference in paragraph (d)
of that definition to 20% were a reference to 30%.
     (3)     However, if at the end of the 30-day period beginning on and including
the day on which the redemption occurs, a unit holder, individually or together
with any associated person, is beneficially entitled to more than 20% of the
units in the unit trust scheme&#8212;
         (a)     the definition of widely held trust in section 3(1)
is taken to have applied to the unit trust scheme during that period as if
subsection (2) had not been enacted; and
         (b)     the Commissioner must determine whether any duty is chargeable under
this Act as a result of the operation of paragraph (a) and if so, must assess
that duty; and
         (c)     a tax default occurs for the purposes of the Taxation
Administration Act 1997 if the whole of any duty assessed under
paragraph (b) is not paid to the Commissioner within 30 days after
liability for the duty arose.
S. 89K substituted by

Section 89K Re-purchase facilities&#8212;wholesale unit trust schemes
     (1)     This section applies if&#8212;
         (a)     the trustee of a unit trust scheme that is registered under
section 89S as a wholesale unit trust scheme redeems any units in the
trust; and
         (b)     as a result of the redemption, the scheme would, but for this section,
cease to be registered under section 89S as a wholesale unit trust scheme
because either of the following applies&#8212;
               (i)     less than 70% of the units in the scheme are held by qualified
investors;
               (ii)     a qualified investor, either alone or together with associated
persons, holds 50% or more of the units in the scheme.
     (2)     For a period of 30 days beginning on and including the day on which
the redemption occurs, the criteria for registration as a wholesale unit trust
scheme in section 89S(2) apply to the wholesale unit trust scheme as
if&#8212;
         (a)     a reference in paragraph (c) to 70% were a reference to 50%;
and
         (b)     a reference in paragraph (d) to 50% were a reference to 70%.
     (3)     However, if at the end of the 30-day period beginning on and including
the day on which the redemption occurs, either of subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii)
applies&#8212;
         (a)     section 89S(2) is taken to have applied to the wholesale unit trust
scheme during that period as if subsection (2) had not been enacted;
and
         (b)     the Commissioner must determine whether any duty is chargeable under
this Act as a result of the operation of paragraph (a) and if so, must
assess that duty; and
         (c)     a tax default occurs for the purposes of the Taxation
Administration Act 1997 if the whole of any duty assessed under
paragraph (b) is not paid to the Commissioner within 30 days after
liability for the duty arose.

     (1)     For the purposes of this Division, a
"tax avoidance scheme" is a scheme that&#8212;
         (a)     directly or indirectly has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect;
or
         (b)     directly or indirectly has tax avoidance as one of its purposes or
effects, if the purpose or effect of tax avoidance is not merely incidental to
another purpose or effect of the scheme&#8212;

avoidance on subsequent acquisitions in landholders that hold the
land.

S. 166(1)
amended by No. 30/2002 s. 8(3).
     (1)     In this section&#8212;
"refinancing mortgage" means a mortgage that secures the amount
of the balance outstanding immediately before the execution of that mortgage
under an earlier mortgage to the same borrower duly stamped under this or a
corresponding Act (whether over the same property or a property previously owned
by the borrower) that is discharged or to be discharged as part of the
arrangements for the new mortgage.
     (2)     For the purposes of subsection (1), mortgages are created to
secure an advance to the same borrower if, either directly by the mortgages
themselves or indirectly through one or more collateral arrangements, the same
person obtains the advances secured by them.
S. 166(3) amended by No. 46/2001
s. 16.
     (3)     A refinancing mortgage is taken to have been stamped with ad valorem
duty as a mortgage in respect of the amount required to discharge the earlier
mortgage (being an amount in relation to which the earlier mortgage was duly
stamped), except as provided by subsection (5).
     (4)     If an advance is refinanced by more than one lender, so that mortgages
given to the lenders together secure the balance outstanding under an earlier
mortgage, the definition of refinancing mortgage in subsection (1)
is to be construed as though&#8212;
         (a)     the reference to a mortgage securing the outstanding balance were a
reference to the aggregate of such mortgages; and
         (b)     each lender were the holder of a refinancing mortgage.
     (5)     If, as provided by subsection (4), each of a number of lenders is the
holder of a refinancing mortgage, a refinancing mortgage held by each lender is
taken to have been duly stamped with ad valorem duty as a mortgage in
respect of an amount equal to the same proportion of the amount required to
discharge the earlier mortgage as the amount secured by that mortgage bears to
the total amount secured by the refinancing mortgages held by all the
lenders.
     (6)     If each of 2 or more refinancing mortgages severally secures the same
advance&#8212;
         (a)     the provisions of subsection (3) or (5), as the case may be, apply to
such one of the mortgages as the Commissioner determines; and
         (b)     no duty is chargeable in respect of any of the others (insofar as it
is a refinancing mortgage) but the Commissioner may denote any of them in the
approved manner.
     (7)     For the purposes of section 165&#8212;
         (a)     a refinancing mortgage that is taken, by the operation of subsection
(3) or (5), to be duly stamped is in either case a stamped mortgage;
and
         (b)     duty is taken to have been paid on it to the extent provided by
whichever of those subsections applies.
     (8)     Duty at the rate of $0.80 per $200 or part of $200 is payable on the
amount by which the advance made under a refinancing mortgage (not being a
mortgage on which, by virtue of subsection (6)(b), no duty is chargeable)
exceeds&#8212;
         (a)     the amount required to discharge the earlier mortgage; or

Section 282A Imposition of foreign purchaser additional duty
     (1)     This section applies if&#8212;
         (a)     a foreign purchaser duty event occurred; and
         (b)     duty was purportedly charged on the foreign purchaser duty event at
the rate set out in section 18A or 28A that applied at the relevant
time; and
         (c)     the duty was purportedly payable on or after 1 January 2018
and before 8 April 2024; and
         (d)     the purported charging of duty on the foreign purchaser duty event was
invalid only because the provisions of this Act that purportedly charged the
duty were to any extent invalid or inoperative under section 109 of the
Constitution of the Commonwealth because of an inconsistency with a provision of
an agreement given the force of law by section 5(1) of the International
Tax Agreements Act 1953 of the Commonwealth.
     (2)     Duty is charged on the foreign purchaser duty event.
     (3)     The liability for duty charged under subsection (2) on a foreign
purchaser duty event is taken to have arisen, and to have always arisen, at the
same time as liability for the purported duty on the foreign purchaser duty
event would have arisen if the purported duty had been validly charged.
     (4)     The duty charged under subsection (2) on a foreign purchaser duty
event is payable by, and is taken to have always been payable by, the person who
would have been liable for the purported duty on the foreign purchaser duty
event if the purported duty had been validly charged.
     (5)     The amount of duty payable under subsection (2) on a foreign
purchaser duty event is the same amount, and is taken to have always been the
same amount, as the amount of duty that would have been payable on the foreign
purchaser duty event if the purported duty had been validly charged.
     (6)     The rights and liabilities of a person in relation to duty charged
under subsection (2) on a foreign purchaser duty event are taken to be, and
to have always been, the same as if the purported duty on the foreign purchaser
duty event had been validly charged.
     (7)     Any act or thing done or omitted to be done by a person in relation to
a foreign purchaser duty event referred to in subsection (1) or the
purported duty on the foreign purchaser duty event has, and is taken to have
always had, the same force and effect as if it were done or omitted to be done
in relation to duty charged under subsection (2).
     (8)     In this section&#8212;
"foreign purchaser duty event "means an event or circumstance
that, if not for the inconsistency referred to in subsection (1)(d), would
have resulted in&#8212;
         (a)     duty being payable under section 18A at the rate set out in that
section; or
         (b)     duty being chargeable under Chapter 2 or 3 at the rate set
out in section 28A;
"purported duty", in relation to a foreign purchaser duty
event, means duty referred to in subsection (1) that was purportedly
charged on the foreign purchaser duty event.
Section 283 Regulations

Minister's second
reading speech&#8212;
Legislative Assembly: 5 October 2000
Legislative Council: 1 November 2000
The long title for the Bill for this Act was "to create and charge a number
of duties, to repeal the Stamps Act 1958, to make consequential
amendments to other Acts and for other purposes."
The Duties Act 2000 was assented to on 28 November 2000 and came
into operation on 1 July 2001: section 2.
INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984
(ILA)
Style changes
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out
in Schedule 1 to that Act.
References to ILA s. 39B
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended by
the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section or
clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the insertion of
the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or
clause.
Interpretation
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the
following effects:
&#8226;     Headings
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed before 1
January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that
Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule;
sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms.
See section 36(1A)(2A).
&#8226;     Examples, diagrams or notes
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on
or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).
&#8226;     Punctuation
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January
Section 2001 forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was
passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B).
&#8226;     Provision numbers
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  See
Section 36(3C).
&#8226;     Location of "legislative items"
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13
October 2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to
be at the foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another
legislative item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at
the foot of a provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items
will be regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section
36B.
&#8226;     Other material
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and other
material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.  See
Section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
     2     Table of Amendments

     3     Explanatory details
[1] S. 28(2): The rate of duty
chargeable on dutiable transactions in respect of marketable securities is dealt
with in section 29.  Concessional rates of duty chargeable on certain dutiable
transactions are dealt with in Part 5 of this Chapter.
[2] Chapter 3: This Chapter
charges duty on certain transactions that are not dutiable
transactions under Chapter 2.  Duty is chargeable under Part 2 of this
Chapter on the acquisition by a person of an interest consisting of certain
shareholdings in a private company, or unitholdings in a private unit trust
scheme, whose property in either case consists, to the prescribed extent, of
land holdings.
The duty is chargeable at the general rate for a dutiable transaction under
Chapter 2, rather than at the rate applicable to transfers of shares and units.
An acquisition statement must be lodged when a majority interest is acquired or
increased.  Duty on an acquisition statement is chargeable only on interests
acquired within a 3-year period.  In certain cases the obligation to pay duty at
the higher rate is phased-in (see section 87).
Duty is chargeable&#8212;
under Part 3 on transactions by which corporate capital is reduced by
redemption, surrender or cancellation of shares or reduction of share value or
alteration of share rights;
under Part 4 on the allotment of shares by direction.
[3] S. 105: Section 10 of the
Financial Sector Reform (Victoria) Act 1999, No. 37/1999 provides that
property transferred under Part 3 of the Financial Sector (Business Transfer and
Group Restructure) Act 1999 of the Commonwealth (the Commonwealth
Act) becomes the property of the receiving body when the certificate of
transfer issued under section 18 of the Commonwealth Act comes into force under
Division 3 of Part 3 of the Commonwealth Act.
[4] Table of Amendments (State
Taxation Acts Amendment Act 2023): The amendment proposed by
section 15(1) of the State Taxation Acts Amendment Act 2023, No.
18/2023 is not included in this publication because the heading to section 58 is
not considered part of this Act: see section 36(2A) of the Interpretation of
Legislation Act 1984, No. 10096/1984.
Section 15(1) reads as follows:
          15     Section 58 amended
     (1)     In the heading to section 58 of the Duties Act 2000, for
"eligible pensioner?" substitute "eligible
cardholder?".
