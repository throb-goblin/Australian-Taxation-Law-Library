(2) A new trustee may be so appointed in any of the following cases, namely-- (a) where a trustee is dead, (b) where a trustee remains out of New South Wales for more than one year without having properly delegated the execution of the trust, (c) where a trustee remains out of New South Wales for more than two years, (d) where a trustee desires to be discharged from all or any of the trusts or powers reposed in or conferred on the trustee, (e) where a trustee refuses or is unfit to act in such trusts or powers, or is incapable of acting therein, or is a minor, (f) where a trustee is removed under a power contained in the instrument creating the trust, (g) where a trustee being a corporation is dissolved. Provided that a new trustee may not be appointed on the sole ground that a trustee remains out of New South Wales for more than two years if such trustee has delegated the execution of the trust pursuant to the Trustee and Wills (Emergency Provisions) Act 1940 and such delegation remains in force. (3) The person to be appointed a trustee may be the person, or one of the persons, by whom or with whose consent the appointment is or may be made. (4) The appointment may be made by the following persons, namely-- (a) by the person or persons nominated for the purpose of appointing new trustees by the instrument, if any, creating the trust, or (b) if there is no such person, or no such person able and willing to act, then by the surviving or continuing trustees or trustee for the time being, or by the legal representative of the last surviving or continuing trustee. (5) The appointment may be made for the whole or any part of the trust property, and on the appointment-- (a) two or more trustees may be appointed concurrently, (b) the number of trustees may be increased, but not beyond four, (c) a separate set of trustees may be appointed for any distinct part of the trust property, that is to say, for any part for the time being held on trusts distinct from those relating to any other part or parts, notwithstanding that no new trustees or trustee are or is to be appointed for other parts, provided that the number of trustees in any separate set shall not exceed four, (d) any existing trustee may be appointed or remain one of the separate set of trustees, (e) if only one trustee was originally appointed, then one separate trustee may be appointed for the distinct part, (f) it shall not be obligatory to appoint more than one new trustee where only one trustee was originally appointed, or to fill up the original number of trustees where more than two trustees were originally appointed. (6) By the appointment a trustee in place of whom the new trustee is appointed shall be discharged from the trust, provided that, except where only one trustee was originally appointed, a trustee shall not be so discharged unless there will be left after the discharge at least two trustees, or the NSW Trustee, or a trustee company, to perform the trust. (7) Any conveyance or thing requisite for vesting the trust property, or any part thereof, jointly in the persons who are the trustees, shall be executed or done. (8) Every new trustee appointed under this section, as well before as after all the trust property becomes by law or by conveyance or otherwise vested in the new trustee, shall have the same powers authorities and discretions, and may in all respects act as if the new trustee had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument, if any, creating the trust. (9) The provisions of this section relative to a trustee who is dead include the case of a person nominated trustee in a will but dying before the testator. (10) The provisions of this section relative to a person nominated for the purpose of appointing new trustees apply, whether the appointment is to be made in a case specified in this section or in a case specified in the instrument, if any, creating the trust, but where a new trustee is appointed under this section in a case specified in that instrument, the appointment shall be subject to the terms applicable to an appointment in that case under the provisions of that"

(5) During the infancy, if the interest of the infant so long continues, the trustee may at any time, if he or she thinks fit, apply the accumulations or any part thereof as if the same were income arising in the then current year. (6) In the following cases the trustee shall hold the accumulations absolutely for the infant, that is to say-- (a) if otherwise than by virtue of this section the infant is entitled to the income which has been accumulated, or (b) if under the provisions of the instrument, if any, creating the trust, the infant is entitled on attaining the age of twenty-one years or on the occurrence of some prior event to a vested interest, whether absolute or liable to be divested, in fee-simple or in full ownership in the property from which the income arose, and the infant in fact becomes entitled to such vested interest. (7) Any accumulations held in trust in accordance with subsection (6) shall be so held without prejudice to any provision with respect thereto contained in any settlement made by the infant under any statute during the infant's infancy. (8) Except in the cases mentioned in subsection (6), and notwithstanding that the person for whom the property is held in trust had a vested interest in the income by virtue of this section, the trustee shall hold the accumulations as an accretion to the capital of the property from which the accumulations arose, and as one fund with such capital for all purposes, and so that if such property is a settled estate within the meaning of Part 4 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1898, the accumulations shall be held on the same trusts as if the same were capital money arising therefrom.
