(2) In this section: commencement means the commencement of the Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2025. Schedule 1 Dutiable instruments and rates of duty Section 4(1) definition dutiable instrument and section 6 1 Conveyances (1) A conveyance of dutiable property is a dutiable instrument. (2) Subject to this clause, the duty payable on a conveyance of dutiable property is determined as follows: (a) if the dutiable value of the dutiable property subject to the conveyance does not exceed $525 000: D = (0.06571441 x V2) + 15V where: D is the duty (expressed in dollars) V is 1/1 000 of the dutiable value (expressed in dollars) (b) if the dutiable value exceeds $525Â 000 but is less thanÂ $3Â 000Â 000, the duty is 4.95% of the dutiable value; (c) if the dutiable value is $3Â 000Â 000 or more but is less than $5Â 000Â 000, the duty is 5.75% of the dutiable value; (d) if the dutiable value is $5 000 000 or more, the duty is 5.95% of the dutiable value. (3) A conveyance of dutiable property by or to joint tenants is, if the conveyor, or one or more of the conveyors, retains an interest in the property, assessed for duty as a conveyance of the interest that is not retained by the conveyor or conveyors rather than the form of the conveyance but an additional $5 is payable. Examples 1 If property is held jointly by 2 persons, and they convey the property to one of them, the conveyance is assessed for ad valorem duty as a conveyance of a half-share of the property and the total amount of the duty is the amount so assessed plus $5. 2 If a sole owner conveys property to him/herself jointly with another, the conveyance is assessed for ad valorem duty as a conveyance of a half-share of the property and the total amount of the duty is the amount so assessed plus $5. (4) If the conveyance is for partition of land between persons who own the land as joint tenants or as tenants in common: (a) in the case of a symmetrical partition of the land: (i) if no consideration is given for the conveyance â the duty is $20; or (ii) if consideration is given for the conveyance â the duty is assessed at the ad valorem rate on the amount or value of the consideration; or (b) in the case of an asymmetrical partition of the land â ad valorem duty is to be assessed on the basis that the conveyance is a conveyance of a proportion of the whole land from the person or persons who take a lesser share (i.e. a share less than their proportionate interest prior to the partition) to the person or persons who take a greater share (i.e. a share greater than their proportionate interest prior to the partition). Note It follows from this that, if consideration is given for an asymmetrical partition, ad valorem duty will be calculated on the amount of the consideration or the relevant proportion of the unencumbered value of the land (whichever is the greater) and, if consideration is not given, on the relevant proportion of the unencumbered value"

(5) For subclause (4), a symmetrical partition of land is one in which the portions resulting from the partition are in accordance with the proportionate interests of the owners prior to the partition; otherwise, the partition is to be regarded as asymmetrical.

(8) The duty payable on a managed investment scheme conveyance is $20. (9) If a conveyance is a grant by the Territory of an estate in fee simple in land, or of a convertible Crown lease, for monetary consideration, the duty is calculated at the ad valorem rate: (a) if paragraphs (b) and (c) do not apply â on the amount of the consideration; or (b) if all of the consideration is unascertainable at the time of the grant â the unencumbered value of the land at that time; or (c) if part of the consideration is unascertainable at the time of the grant â on the greater of the following: (i) the amount of the consideration that is ascertainable at that time; (ii) the unencumbered value of the land at that time.

(2) Duty is only chargeable on the grant of a lease if, in addition to or instead of rent payable for the lease, valuable consideration is given: (a) for the lease; or (b) for an option under which the lease is granted. (3) If valuable consideration in addition to, or instead of, rent is given for a lease, duty is to be calculated at the ad valorem conveyance rate on the amount or value of the consideration. (4) However, if a lease is entered into subsequent to, and in conformity with, an agreement for the lease that has been stamped with ad valorem duty, the duty payable on the lease is $5. Section 5 Motor vehicle certificate of registration (1) A motor vehicle certificate of registration is a dutiable instrument. (2) The duty payable on a motor vehicle certificate of registration is $3 for every $100 or fractional part of $100 of the dutiable value of the motor vehicle.
