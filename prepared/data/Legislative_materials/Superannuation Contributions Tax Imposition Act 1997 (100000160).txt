Notes 9

An Act to impose a superannuation contributions tax and to declare the rate
of the tax

1  Short title [see Note 1]

            This Act may be cited as the Superannuation Contributions Tax
         Imposition Act 1997.

2  Commencement [see Note 1]

            This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal
         Assent.

3  Interpretation

            Expressions used in this Act that are defined by the
         Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act
         1997 have the same meanings as in that Act.

4  Imposition of superannuation contributions surcharge

            The superannuation contributions surcharge that is payable on a
         memberâs surchargeable contributions for a financial year under the
         Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act
         1997 is imposed by this Act.

         Note:    Surcharge is not payable for the financial year that began
                on 1Â July 2005 or a later financial yearâsee subsection 7(1)
                of the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and
                Collection) Act 1997.

5  Rate of superannuation contributions surcharge

      (1AA) In this section:

         higher income amount means:
      (a)   for the 2003-2004 financial yearâ$114,981; and
      (b)   for the 2004-2005 financial yearâthat amount as indexed under
             sectionÂ 7.

         lower income amount means:
      (a)   for the 2003-2004 financial yearâ$94,691; and
      (b)   for the 2004-2005 financial yearâthat amount as indexed under
             sectionÂ 7.

         maximum surcharge percentage means:
      (a)   for the 2003-2004 financial yearâ14.5%; and
      (b)   for the 2004-2005 financial yearâ12.5%.

      (1)   Unless subsectionÂ (3) applies, if the memberâs adjusted taxable
         income for a financial year (relevant adjusted taxable income) is
         not less than the lower income amount but is less than the higher
         income amount, the rate of the superannuation contributions
         surcharge that applies to the member for that year is the
         percentage (calculated to 5 decimal places) of the memberâs
         surchargeable contributions for that year worked out using the
         formula:
         where:

         A is:

      (1A)  If the percentage calculated under subsectionÂ (1) for a
         financial year would, if it were worked out to 6 decimal places,
         end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is
         increased by 0.00001.

      (2)   If the memberâs adjusted taxable income for a financial year is
         equal to, or greater than, the higher income amount, the rate of
         the superannuation contributions surcharge that applies to the
         member for that year is the maximum surcharge percentage of the
         memberâs surchargeable contributions for that year.

      (3)   If:
      (a)   the member has not quoted his or her tax file number in
             connection with the operation or the possible future operation
             of the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Collection and
             Assessment) Act 1997 to the superannuation provider, or one of
             the superannuation providers, who, at the end of a financial
             year, held any of the memberâs surchargeable contributions for
             that year; and
      (b)   the Commissioner has not, after taking all reasonable steps,
             found out the memberâs tax file number; and
      (c)   the Commissioner has written a letter to the member at the
             memberâs last-known address telling the member that, if the
             member does not quote his or her tax file number, the rate of
             surcharge that will apply to the member for a financial year
             (the relevant financial year) may be the maximum surcharge
             percentage of the memberâs surchargeable contributions for the
             relevant financial year;
         the following provisions have effect:
      (d)   if contributed amounts in respect of contributions began to be
             paid for or by the member to a superannuation provider before
             7Â May 1997 and the memberâs surchargeable contributions for the
             relevant financial year exceed the surchargeable contributions
             thresholdâthe rate of surcharge that applies in respect of the
             memberâs surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial
             year is the maximum surcharge percentage of those
             contributions;
      (e)   if contributed amounts in respect of contributions began to be
             paid for or by the member to a superannuation provider before
             7Â May 1997 and the memberâs surchargeable contributions for the
             relevant financial year do not exceed the surchargeable
             contributions thresholdâthe rate of surcharge that applies in
             respect of the memberâs surchargeable contributions for the
             relevant financial year is nil;
      (f)   subject to subsectionÂ (4), if no contributed amounts in respect
             of contributions began to be paid for or by the member to a
             superannuation provider before 7Â May 1997âthe rate of surcharge
             that applies in respect of the memberâs surchargeable
             contributions for the relevant financial year is the maximum
             surcharge percentage of those contributions.

      (4)   If:
      (a)   the Commissioner has written a letter to a member as mentioned
             in paragraphÂ (3)(c); and
      (b)   the member has not quoted his or her tax file number as
             mentioned in paragraphÂ (3)(a) within 3 months after the letter
             was sent;
         paragraphÂ (3)(f) does not apply in respect of the member unless the
         Commissioner has, after that period, written a further letter to
         the member:
      (c)   to an address determined by the Commissioner as most
             appropriate for the letter to reach the member; and
      (d)   in the same terms as the earlier letter.

6  Surchargeable contributions threshold

         Surchargeable contributions threshold for the 1996-97 financial
         year

      (1)   The surchargeable contributions threshold for the 1996-97
         financial year is $2,000.

         Surchargeable contributions for a later financial year

      (2)   The surchargeable contributions threshold for a financial year
         (the relevant financial year) after the 1996-97 financial year is
         the amount worked out using the formula:

         where:

         previous threshold means the surchargeable contributions threshold
         for the financial year immediately before the relevant financial
         year.

         indexation factor means the number worked out under subsections
         9(4) and (5) of the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment
         and Collection) Act 1997 for the relevant financial year.

         current charge percentage means the number that is specified in
         subsection 19(2) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration)
         Act 1992 for the quarter beginning on 1Â July of the relevant
         financial year.

         previous charge percentage means the number that is specified in
         subsection 19(2) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration)
         Act 1992 for the quarter beginning on 1Â July of the financial year
         immediately before the relevant financial year.

7  Indexation

         Indexation of certain amounts for 2004-05 financial year

      (1)   SectionÂ 5 applies in relation to an indexing financial year as
         if each indexable amount were replaced by the amount worked out
         using the formula:
         where:

         previous indexable amount means the indexable amount for the
         financial year immediately before the indexing financial year.

         relevant indexation factor means the indexation factor for the
         indexing financial year.

         Rounding off of indexed amounts

      (2)   If an amount worked out under subsectionÂ (1) is an amount of
         dollars and cents:
      (a)   if the number of cents is less than 50âthe amount is to be
             rounded down to the nearest whole dollar; or
      (b)   otherwiseâthe amount is to be rounded up to the nearest whole
             dollar.

         Indexation factor

      (3)   The indexation factor for an indexing financial year is the
         number calculated, to 3 decimal places, using the formula:
         where:

         current March year means the period of 12 months ending on 31Â March
         immediately before the indexing financial year.

         previous March year means the period of 12 months immediately
         before the current March year.

         Rounding up of indexation factor

      (4)   If the number calculated under subsectionÂ (3) for a financial
         year would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end with a
         number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by
         0.001.

         Change in index numbers

      (5)   If, at any time, whether before or after the commencement of
         this Act, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an
         index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number
         previously published for the quarter, the publication of the later
         index number is to be disregarded.

         Indexable amounts to be published

      (6)   The Commissioner must publish before, or as soon as practicable
         after, the start of the 2004-05 financial year the indexable
         amounts as replaced under subsectionÂ (1) for that year.

         Definitions

      (7)   In this section:

         indexable amount means:
      (a)   an amount stated in sectionÂ 5; or
      (b)   if that amount has previously been altered under this
             sectionâthe altered amount.

         indexing financial year means the 2004-05 financial year.

         index number, for a quarter, means the estimate of full-time adult
         average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the
         quarter published by the Australian Statistician.

         Note:    For the purposes of this section, Australian Statistician
                means the Australian Statistician referred to in subsection
                5(2) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975.

8  Severability

            If, apart from this section, sectionÂ 4 would impose in relation
         to a State, or an authority or officer of a State, a superannuation
         contributions surcharge the imposition of which in relation to the
         State, authority or officer would exceed the legislative power of
         the Commonwealth, sectionÂ 4 has effect as if it did not impose that
         surcharge in relation to the State, authority or officer, as the
         case may be.

9  Act does not impose tax on property of State

      (1)   Without limiting sectionÂ 7, this Act does not impose a tax on
         property of any kind belonging to a State.

      (2)   In this section:

         property of any kind belonging to a State has the same meaning as
         in sectionÂ 114 of the Constitution.
