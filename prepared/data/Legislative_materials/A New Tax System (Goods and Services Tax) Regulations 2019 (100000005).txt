1997)
Note 1:	If something is within the scope of both an item in the table in this subsection and an
item in the table in section 40-5.12, it will not be a financial supply (see
paragraph 40-5.08(a)).
Note 2:	Subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) has the effect that a supply by a financial supply facilitator is
not a financial supply.
Note 3:	Supply of something that is mentioned in more than one item in the table in this
subsection will still be a financial supply.
	(4)	A supply by an Australian ADI for a fee of not more than $1,000 is a financial
supply if:
	(a)	item 1 of the table in subsection (3) does not apply to the supply because
the recipient of the supply does not have an account with the ADI but the
item would have applied to the supply if the recipient had an account with
the ADI; or
	(b)	the fee relates to an application to the ADI that, if accepted, would result in
the creation of an account by the ADI.
Example 1:	For paragraph (a), electronic transfer to another Australian ADI for a person who does
not hold an account with the ADI.
Example 2:	For paragraph (b), a loan application fee.
	(5)	A supply by an entity for a fee of not more than $1,000 is a financial supply if it
is a supply of one or more of the following ATM services:
	(a)	a withdrawal from an account;
	(b)	a deposit into an account;
	(c)	an electronic transfer from an account;
	(d)	advice of the balance of an account.
	(6)	A reference in item 10 of the table in subsection (3) to a security does not include
a security in relation to which an entity is given a right to participate in a barter
scheme under which each participant may obtain goods or services from another
participant for consideration that is wholly or substantially in kind rather than in
cash.
Regulation 40-5.10 Incidental financial supplies
		If something is supplied by an entity to a recipient directly in connection with a
financial supply to the recipient by the entity, the thing is an incidental financial
supply if:
	(a)	it is incidental to the financial supply; and
	(b)	it and the financial supply are supplied, at or about the same time, but not
for separate consideration; and
	(c)	it is the usual practice of the entity to supply the thing, or similar things,
and the financial supply together in the ordinary course of the entity's
enterprise.
Note:	Section 40-5.12 does not apply in relation to incidental financial supplies. As a result, if
something is both an incidental financial supply and within the scope of an item in the
table in section 40-5.12, it will still be a financial supply.
Example:	Advice, for which a separate charge is not made, in relation to a housing loan.

	(1)	Schedule 2 sets out examples of supplies that relate to matters mentioned in the
table in subsection 40-5.09(3).

receiving enterprise) from an enterprise outside the indirect tax zone
(a supplying enterprise); or
	(ii)	the doing of something for a receiving enterprise by a supplying
enterprise; and
	(b)	the relevant supply is a taxable supply because of section 84-5 of the Act
(including a supply that is not connected to the indirect tax zone because of
section 84-15 of the Act); and
	(c)	the receiving enterprise and the supplying enterprise are closely related.
	(2)	In determining the reduced credit acquisition, the price of the relevant supply is
