After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).

After its application in the ACT, the Trustee Act 1925 (as it applied in the ACT) was amended (directly or indirectly) by Commonwealth laws made before self-government and ACT laws made after self-government. The Interpretation Act 1967 , section 65 converted all former New South Wales acts in force in the ACT immediately before 10 November 1999 into laws made by the Legislative Assembly. The Trustee Act 1957 was repealed by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) and the remaining provisions affecting the operation of the Trustee Act Section 1925 were incorporated into that Act by amendment. The provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 (also a former NSW Act) were remade by the Statute Law Amendment Act 2001 (No 2) as part of the Trustee Act 1925.  The Conveyancing and Law of Property (Supplemental) Act 1901 has been repealed in NSW. Before 11 May 1989, ordinances commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cwlth), s 12). After 11 May and before 10 November 1999, Acts commenced on notification day unless otherwise stated (see Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwlth), s 25).
