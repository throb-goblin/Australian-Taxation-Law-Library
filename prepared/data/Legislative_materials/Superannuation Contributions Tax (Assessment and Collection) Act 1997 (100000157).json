Only surchargeable contributions calculated for a period after 7.30 pm on 20  August 1996 are subject to surcharge.(c) For a defined benefits superannuation scheme, the surcharge is payable on an amount calculated to be the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year.(d) If surcharge is payable for a member for a financial year under an assessment made before 23  March 1999, an advance instalment of one-half of the surcharge is payable on account of surcharge payable for the member for the next financial year. However, no instalment is payable if the contributions for the next financial year are held under an unfunded defined benefits superannuation scheme.(e) If, after the assessment of surcharge, the member&#39;s adjusted taxable income is found to be different from the amount that was previously calculated or the surchargeable contributions are found to be different from the amount on which the assessment was based: (i) if the person who was liable to pay the assessed surcharge is still the holder of the contributions--the Commissioner may amend the assessment; or\n (ii) otherwise--the Commissioner may make a further assessment of surcharge.\n        (f) The holder of a member&#39;s surchargeable contributions for a financial year is liable to pay:\n (i) the surcharge on those contributions; and (ii) if the liability to pay the surcharge arose under an assessment made before 23 March 1999--any advance instalment on the member&#39;s surchargeable contributions for the next financial year;\n within prescribed periods.(g) However, if the holder is a superannuation (unfunded defined benefits) provider, the surcharge is not payable until benefits become payable.(h) If liability for surcharge is increased as a result of an amendment of an assessment or the making of a further assessment, interest is payable on the additional surcharge.(i) Either a superannuation provider or a member may object against an assessment of surcharge in the way set out in Part  IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 for objecting against assessments of income tax.(j) A late payment penalty applies if surcharge or an advance instalment is not paid on time."

Period for making further amendment (2) If: (a) an assessment has been amended in any particular in a way that effected a reduction in the amount of surcharge payable; and (b) for the purposes of making the amendment, the Commissioner accepted a statement made by or on behalf of a member or a superannuation provider; the Commissioner may, within 4 years from the date of service of the notice of the amended assessment, further amend the assessment in, or in respect of, that particular in a way that increases the amount of the surcharge payable to the extent that the Commissioner considers necessary. Period where avoidance of surcharge (3) Subject to this section, if there has been an avoidance of surcharge, the Commissioner may: (a) if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the avoidance of surcharge is due to fraud or evasion--at any time; or (b) in any other case--within 4 years from the date upon which the surcharge became due and payable under the assessment; amend the assessment by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner thinks necessary to correct the assessment. Period where amendment reduces surcharge (4) An amendment effecting a reduction in the amount of surcharge payable under an assessment is not to be made after the end of 4 years from the date upon which the surcharge became due and payable under the assessment. Application or request for extension of period (5) If: (a) the Commissioner has begun an examination of the affairs of a member or a superannuation provider; and (b) the examination was not completed within the period within which the Commissioner may amend an assessment to which the examination relates under subsection (3) or, if that period has been extended by any previous order or orders of the Federal Court of Australia made under subsection (6), or by any previous consent or consents of the member or provider given under subsection (7), within that period as so extended; the Commissioner may, before the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection, apply to the Federal Court for an order extending, or request the member or provider to consent to the extension of, the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b). Court may extend period (6) If, on application made to the Federal Court of Australia in accordance with subsection (5), the Court is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable, or it was inappropriate, for the Commissioner to complete the examination within the period referred to in paragraph (5)(b) because of any action taken by the member or superannuation provider or any failure of the member or superannuation provider to take action that it would have been reasonable for the member or provider to take, the Court may make an order extending the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b) for such period as the Court considers appropriate. Member or provider may extend period (7) If a request is made to the member or superannuation provider in accordance with subsection (5), the member or provider may, by writing, consent to the extension of the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b) for such period as is specified in the instrument of consent.
