(14) The number of gaming machines determined under subsectionÂ (12): (a) is not to be greater than the number sought in the application or the maximum number prescribed for the category of licensed premises to which the licensed premises the subject of the application belongs; and (b) is not to result in contravention of a restriction imposed under Part 2A. (15) The Director shall, as soon as practicable after a decision is made on the application, give the applicant written notice of: (a) the decision; and (b) if the application is refused, the reasons for the refusal. (16) On the grant of a gaming machine licence, the gaming machine areas are those locations on licensed premises indicated in the plan referred to in sectionÂ 24(3)(g) or that plan as last amended and resubmitted under subsectionÂ (4)."
