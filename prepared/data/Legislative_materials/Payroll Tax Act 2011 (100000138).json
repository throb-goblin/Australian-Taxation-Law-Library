Note Section 66A (Wages paid or payable in relation to services performed in other countries) provides an exemption for wages paid or payable in relation to services performed entirely in 1 or more other countries for a continuous period of more than 6 months. (2) The question of whether wages are taxable in the ACT must be decided by taking into account only the services performed by the employee in relation to the employer in the month in which the wages are paid or payable. (3) Any wages paid or payable by an employer in relation to an employee in a month are taken to be paid or payable in relation to the services performed by the employee in relation to the employer in that month. Example If wages paid in a month are paid to an employee in relation to services performed over several months, the question of whether the wages are taxable in the ACT must be decided by taking into account only services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid. Services performed in previous months are disregarded (services performed in previous months will be relevant to the question of whether wages paid in the previous months are taxable in the ACT). (4) However, if no services are performed by an employee in relation to an employer in the month in which wages are paid or payable in relation to the employee-- (a) the question of whether the wages are taxable in the ACT must be decided by taking into account only the services performed by the employee in relation to the employer in the most recent prior month in which the employee performed services in relation to the employer; and (b) the wages are taken to be paid or payable in relation to the services performed by the employee in relation to the employer in that most recent prior month. (5) Also, if no services were performed by an employee in relation to an employer in the month in which wages are paid or payable in relation to the employee or in any prior month-- (a) the wages are taken to be paid or payable in relation to services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable; and (b) the services are taken to have been performed at a place or places where it may be reasonably expected that the services of the employee in relation to the employer will be performed. (6) All amounts of wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer in relation to the same employee must be aggregated for the purpose of deciding whether they are taxable in the ACT (as if they were paid or payable for all services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable, or the most recent prior month). Example If 1 amount of wages is paid by an employer in a particular month for services performed in the ACT, and another amount of wages is paid by the same employer in the same month for services performed by the same employee in another Australian jurisdiction, the wages paid must be aggregated (as if they were paid for all services performed by the employee in that month).

Corporations A and B form part of a chain of corporations, and\ncorporation B is linked to corporation A.  Accordingly, an entity that has a\ndirect interest in corporation A also has an indirect interest in\ncorporation B.\nCorporation B also has a direct interest in corporation C.  In this case,\ncorporations A, B and C form part of a chain of corporations.  Both corporations\nB and C are linked to corporation A.  The entity that has a direct interest in\ncorporation A has an indirect interest in both corporations B\nand C.\nCorporation B also has a direct interest in corporation D.  There are now 2\nchains of corporations, 1 consisting of A, B and C, and 1 consisting of A, B and\nD.  Corporations B, C and D are all linked to corporation A and an entity that\nhas a direct interest in corporation A would have an indirect interest in\ncorporations B, C and D.  An entity that has a direct interest in corporation B\nwould have an indirect interest in corporations C and D.  However, an entity\nthat has a direct interest in corporation C only would not have an indirect\ninterest in corporation D, as corporation D is not linked to corporation\nC.\n     (3)     The value of the indirect interest of an entity in a corporation (an\nindirectly controlled corporation) that is linked to a directly\ncontrolled corporation is worked out by multiplying together the following:\n         (a)     the value of the direct interest of the entity in the directly\ncontrolled corporation;\n         (b)     the value of each direct interest that forms a link in the chain of\ncorporations by which the indirectly controlled corporation is linked to the\ndirectly controlled corporation.\nExample\nAn entity has a direct interest (with a value of 80%) in corporation A.\nCorporation A has a direct interest (with a value of 70%) in corporation B.  The\nvalue of the indirect interest of the entity in corporation B is 80% x\n70% (that is, 56%).  Accordingly, the entity has a controlling interest in\ncorporation B under s 73 (Groups arising from tracing of interests in\ncorporations).\nCorporation B also has a direct interest (with a value of 40%) in\ncorporation C.  The value of the indirect interest of the entity in corporation\nC is 80% x 70% x 40% (that is, 22&#183;4%).  Accordingly, the entity\ndoes not have a controlling interest in corporation C.\n     (4)     It is possible for an entity to have more than 1 indirect interest in\na corporation.\nExamples\nSection 1 An entity may have more than 1 indirect interest in a corporation if the\ncorporation is linked to more than 1 corporation in which the entity has a\ndirect interest.\nSection 2 An entity may have more than 1 indirect interest in a corporation if the\ncorporation is linked to only 1 corporation in which the entity has a direct\ninterest, but is linked through more than 1 chain of corporations.  In this\ncase, the entity has an aggregate interest in the corporation (see\ns 78)."

Section 1.13 Continuous recording method If an employer selects the continuous recording method for the purpose of working out the number of business kilometres travelled in a financial year, the following details are required to be recorded by the employer: (a)     the odometer readings at the beginning and end of each business journey (a \"relevant business journey\") undertaken by the person in the financial year by means of a motor vehicle provided or maintained by the person; (b)     the specific purpose for which each relevant business journey was taken; (c)     the distance travelled by the person in the financial year in the course of all relevant business journeys (which is taken to be the number of business kilometres travelled in the financial year), worked out on the basis of the odometer readings mentioned in paragraph (a). Section 1.14 Averaging method (1)     If an employer selects the averaging method for the purpose of working out the number of business kilometres travelled in a financial year, the following details are required to be recorded by the employer: (a)     the odometer readings at the beginning and end of each business journey (a \"relevant business journey\") undertaken by the person in the relevant 12-week period by means of a motor vehicle provided or maintained by the person; Note     Relevant 12-week period is defined in s 1.15.

(2)     For the next 4 financial years after the first financial year in which odometer details are recorded in accordance with subsection (1), an employer is not required to work out the relevant percentage, or record the details mentioned in subsection (1) (a) to (f), for the person but is required to record the other details mentioned in subsection (1). (3)     Accordingly, for the next 4 financial years after the first financial year in which odometer details are recorded in accordance with subsection (1), the number of business kilometres travelled in the financial year must be worked out (as mentioned in subsection (1) (i)) on the basis of the relevant percentage worked out for the first financial year. (4)     Despite subsections (2) and (3), an employer is required to work out the relevant percentage for a financial year, and record the details mentioned in subsection (1) (a) to (f), if-- (a)     the commissioner serves a notice on the employer before the beginning of a financial year in the 4-year period directing the employer to keep the details mentioned in subsection (1) (a) to (f) for the financial year; or (b)     the employer wishes to use the recording method mentioned in this section for 1 or more additional motor vehicles used by the person in any financial year or for any other reason.

(6)     An employer who has adopted and employed the method of recording mentioned in subsections (2) and (3) for a person for 4 successive financial years must, in the next succeeding financial year, make a fresh recording of all the details stated in subsection (1) if the employer intends to continue to use the same method of recording for the person. (7)     Subsections (2) and (3) apply in relation to the new record under subsection (6) for the financial year as if it were the first financial year in which odometer details were recorded. (8)     If the odometer of a motor vehicle is replaced or recalibrated in any period for which its readings are relevant for this section, the odometer readings immediately before and after the replacement or recalibration must be recorded. Section 1.15 Meaning of relevant 12-week period--s 1.16 (1)     For section 1.14, relevant 12-week period means a continuous period of at least 12 weeks, selected by the employer, throughout which a motor vehicle is provided or maintained by a person. (2)     If the motor vehicle is provided or maintained for less than Section 12 weeks, the period must be the entire period for which the motor vehicle is provided or maintained. (3)     The period may overlap the beginning or end of the financial year, so long as it includes part of the year. (4)     If the averaging method is used for 2 or more motor vehicles for the same financial year, the odometer readings for those motor vehicles must cover periods that are concurrent. Section 1.16 Replacing one motor vehicle with another motor vehicle (1)     For the purpose of using the averaging method, an employer may nominate 1 motor vehicle as having replaced another motor vehicle with effect from a day stated in the nomination. (2)     After the nomination takes effect, the replacement motor vehicle is treated as the original motor vehicle, and the original motor vehicle is treated as a different motor vehicle. (3)     An employer need not repeat for the replacement vehicle the steps already taken for the original motor vehicle. (4)     An employer must record the nomination in writing in the financial year when the nomination takes effect. (5)     However, the commissioner may allow an employer to record the nomination at a later time. Section 1.17 Changing method of recording (1)     An employer may change from using the averaging method to using the continuous recording method with effect from the beginning of a financial year if the employer complies with section 1.13 (Continuous recording method) for the financial year. (2)     An employer may change from using the continuous recording method to using the averaging method with effect from the beginning of a financial year if the employer complies with section 1.14 (Averaging method) for the financial year.

(4)     Despite subsections (2) and (3), an employer is required to work out the relevant percentage for a financial year, and record the details mentioned in subsection (1) (a) to (f), if-- (a)     the commissioner serves a notice on the employer before the beginning of a financial year in the 4-year period directing the employer to keep the details mentioned in subsection (1) (a) to (f) for the financial year; or (b)     the employer wishes to use the recording method mentioned in this section for 1 or more additional motor vehicles used by the person in any financial year or for any other reason. (5)     In a situation mentioned in subsection (4), the new record for the financial year replaces the relevant percentage details previously recorded and subsections (2) and (3) apply in relation to the new record for the financial year as if it were the first financial year in which odometer details were recorded. (6)     An employer who has adopted and employed the method of recording mentioned in subsections (2) and (3) for a person for 4 successive financial years must, in the next succeeding financial year, make a fresh recording of all the details stated in subsection (1) if the employer intends to continue to use the same method of recording for the person. (7)     Subsections (2) and (3) apply in relation to the new record under subsection (6) for the financial year as if it were the first financial year in which odometer details were recorded. (8)     If the odometer of a motor vehicle is replaced or recalibrated in any period for which its readings are relevant for this section, the odometer readings immediately before and after the replacement or recalibration must be recorded. Section 1.15 Meaning of relevant 12-week period--s 1.16 (1)     For section 1.14, relevant 12-week period means a continuous period of at least 12 weeks, selected by the employer, throughout which a motor vehicle is provided or maintained by a person. (2)     If the motor vehicle is provided or maintained for less than Section 12 weeks, the period must be the entire period for which the motor vehicle is provided or maintained. (3)     The period may overlap the beginning or end of the financial year, so long as it includes part of the year. (4)     If the averaging method is used for 2 or more motor vehicles for the same financial year, the odometer readings for those motor vehicles must cover periods that are concurrent. Section 1.16 Replacing one motor vehicle with another motor vehicle (1)     For the purpose of using the averaging method, an employer may nominate 1 motor vehicle as having replaced another motor vehicle with effect from a day stated in the nomination. (2)     After the nomination takes effect, the replacement motor vehicle is treated as the original motor vehicle, and the original motor vehicle is treated as a different motor vehicle. (3)     An employer need not repeat for the replacement vehicle the steps already taken for the original motor vehicle. (4)     An employer must record the nomination in writing in the financial year when the nomination takes effect. (5)     However, the commissioner may allow an employer to record the nomination at a later time. Section 1.17 Changing method of recording (1)     An employer may change from using the averaging method to using the continuous recording method with effect from the beginning of a financial year if the employer complies with section 1.13 (Continuous recording method) for the financial year. (2)     An employer may change from using the continuous recording method to using the averaging method with effect from the beginning of a financial year if the employer complies with section 1.14 (Averaging method) for the financial year.
