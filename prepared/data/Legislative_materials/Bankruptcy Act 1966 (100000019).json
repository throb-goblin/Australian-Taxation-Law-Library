(2A) The Official Receiver must reject a debtor&#39;s petition unless, at the time when the petition is presented, the debtor: (a) was personally present or ordinarily resident in Australia; or (b) had a dwelling-house or place of business in Australia; or (c) was carrying on business in Australia, either personally or by means of an agent or manager; or (d) was a member of a firm or partnership carrying on business in Australia by means of a partner or partners or of an agent or manager.

(3AA) The Official Receiver may reject a debtor&#39;s petition (the current petition) if: (aa) the Official Receiver has accepted under subsection 57B(1) a statement of affairs filed by the debtor for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) of this section; and (a) it appears from the information in the statement of affairs (and any additional information supplied by the debtor) that, if the debtor did not become a bankrupt, the debtor would be likely (either immediately or within a reasonable time) to be able to pay all the debts specified in the statement of affairs; and (b) at least one of the following applies: (i) it appears from the information in the statement of affairs (and any additional information supplied by the debtor) that the debtor is unwilling to pay one or more debts to a particular creditor or creditors, or is unwilling to pay creditors in general; (ii) before the current petition was presented, the debtor previously became a bankrupt on a debtor&#39;s petition at least 3 times, or at least once in the period of 5 years before presentation of the current petition. (3AB) The Official Receiver is not required to consider in each case whether there is a discretion to reject under subsection (3AA). (3AC) The debtor may apply to the Administrative Review Tribunal for the review of a decision by the Official Receiver to reject a petition under subsection (3AA). (3A) Before accepting a debtor&#39;s petition the Official Receiver must give the debtor the information prescribed by the regulations. (3B) The Official Receiver must refer a debtor&#39;s petition to the Court for a direction to accept or reject it if there is a creditor&#39;s petition pending against a group of debtors (whether they are joint debtors or members of a partnership) that includes the debtor against whom the debtor&#39;s petition is presented. Example 1: When Anna presents a debtor&#39;s petition against herself, there is a creditor&#39;s petition pending against Anna and Tim as joint debtors. The Official Receiver must refer the debtor&#39;s petition to the Court. Example 2: When Peter presents a debtor&#39;s petition against himself, there are 2 creditor&#39;s petitions pending against him alone. The Official Receiver is not required to refer the debtor&#39;s petition to the Court, because Peter does not form a group by himself. (3C) If the Court directs the Official Receiver to accept the debtor&#39;s petition, the Court must specify the time of the commencement of the bankruptcy that results from acceptance of the debtor&#39;s petition. (4) The Official Receiver must accept a debtor&#39;s petition, unless the Official Receiver rejects it under this section or is directed by the Court to reject it. (4A) Where the Official Receiver accepts a petition presented under this section: (a) he or she shall endorse the petition accordingly; and (b) upon the Official Receiver endorsing the petition, the debtor who presented the petition becomes a bankrupt by force of this section and by virtue of presentation of the petition. (5) If a registered trustee is the trustee of the estate of a debtor who becomes a bankrupt under this section, the Official Receiver must: (a) notify the trustee of the bankruptcy; and (b) give the trustee a copy"

(8) A person who becomes a bankrupt by force of this section continues to be a bankrupt until: (a) he or she is discharged by force of subsection 149(1); or (b) his or her bankruptcy is annulled by force of subsection 74(1) or 153A(1) or under section 153B. (9) A person who states in writing that he or she is a creditor of a bankrupt who has become a bankrupt by force of this section may without fee, and any other person may on payment of the fee determined by the Minister by legislative instrument, inspect, personally or by an agent, the statement of affairs that accompanied the petition presented by the bankrupt, and may obtain a copy of, or take extracts from, the statement.

(11A) Subsection (11) does not prevent the making available of information as required by law. (12) The Official Receiver may refuse to allow a person access under this section to particular information in a bankrupt&#39;s statement of affairs on the ground that access to that information would jeopardise, or be likely to jeopardise, the safety of any person."

(3AA) The Official Receiver may reject a debtor&#39;s petition (the current petition) if the following conditions are satisfied for at least one of the petitioning debtors: (a) it appears from the information in the statement of affairs (and any additional information supplied by the debtor) that, if the debtor did not become a bankrupt, the debtor would be likely (either immediately or within a reasonable time) to be able to pay all the debts specified in the debtor&#39;s statement of affairs; (b) at least one of the following applies: (i) it appears from the information in the statement of affairs (and any additional information supplied by the debtor) that the debtor is unwilling to pay one or more debts to a particular creditor or creditors, or is unwilling to pay creditors in general; (ii) before the current petition was presented, the debtor previously became a bankrupt on a debtor&#39;s petition at least 3 times, or at least once in the period of 5 years before presentation of the current petition. (3AB) The Official Receiver is not required to consider in each case whether there is a discretion to reject under subsection (3AA).

Example 1: Peta and Abdul are joint debtors. When they present a debtor&#39;s petition against themselves, there is a creditor&#39;s petition pending against Abdul. The Official Receiver must refer the debtor&#39;s petition to the Court, because the creditor&#39;s petition does not relate to both Peta and Abdul. Example 2: Joan and Craig are joint debtors. When they present a debtor&#39;s petition against themselves, there is a creditor&#39;s petition pending against Joan, Craig and Paul. The Official Receiver must refer the debtor&#39;s petition to the Court. Example 3: Kim, Robin and Jane are joint debtors. When they present a debtor&#39;s petition against themselves, there is a creditor&#39;s petition pending against Kim, Robin and Jane, and no -one else.

(5) The Court may, in relation to an application for leave to disclaim a lease under this section: (a) impose such terms as a condition of granting the leave; and (b) make such orders with respect to fixtures, improvements and other matters arising out of the lease; as the Court considers just and equitable.

(5B) The Court may, in relation to an application for leave to disclaim a contract under this section: (a) impose such terms as a condition of granting the leave; and (b) make such orders with respect to matters arising out of the contract; as the Court considers just and equitable.

(11) Where: (a) the property to which such an order relates is property the transfer of which is required by a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory to be registered; and (b) that law enables the registration of such an order; the property, notwithstanding that it vests in equity in the person named in the order, does not vest in that person at law until the requirements of that law have been complied with. (12) A person aggrieved by the operation of a disclaimer under this section shall be deemed to be a creditor of the bankrupt to the extent of any loss he or she has suffered by reason of the disclaimer and may prove the loss as a debt in the bankruptcy. (13) In this section: \"mortgage\" includes charge. \"mortgagee\" includes the person entitled to the benefit of a charge."

If the trustee fails to comply with the direction, the Inspector-General can direct that the trustee accept no further appointments or seek an order from the Court directing the trustee to comply.Correcting and completing information given to the Inspector-GeneralIf the Inspector-General reasonably suspects that information that a registered trustee is required to give the Inspector -General under this Act is incomplete or inaccurate, the Inspector-General can direct the trustee to confirm, complete or correct the information. The Inspector -General can also direct the trustee to tell someone about the defect in the information. If the trustee fails to comply with a direction, the Inspector-General can direct that the trustee accept no further appointments or seek an order from the Court directing the trustee to comply.Other grounds for a direction not to accept further appointmentsThere are other grounds on which the Inspector-General can issue a direction not to accept further appointments, for example, if the registered trustee fails to comply with a direction to convene a meeting.Suspending or cancelling registrationAn individual&#39;s registration as a trustee can be suspended or cancelled.The registration is automatically cancelled if the registered trustee becomes an insolvent under administration or dies.In some circumstances, the Inspector-General can suspend or cancel the registration of a person as a trustee. The Inspector -General can also give a registered trustee notice to show-cause why the trustee should continue to be registered. If the Inspector-General is not satisfied with the answer, the Inspector -General can refer the matter to a committee which will make a decision on what action should be taken.An industry body can give the Inspector-General notice of possible grounds for disciplinary action.If a registration is suspended, the trustee can apply to the Inspector-General to have the suspension lifted or shortened.A decision about the suspension or cancellation of the registration of a trustee is reviewable by the Administrative Review Tribunal (see Division  96 of this Schedule).\nSubdivision B--Direction to comply"

A person can exercise the right in a particular capacity to appoint only one person (unless the person is filling a vacancy in that appointment).Procedures and powersThis Division also deals with the procedures and powers of committees of inspection (including directing that information, documents and reports be provided by the trustee and obtaining specialist advice).The trustee of a regulated debtor&#39;s estate must have regard to directions of the committee but is not obliged to comply.ReviewThe Court may inquire into and make orders about the conduct of committees of inspection."
