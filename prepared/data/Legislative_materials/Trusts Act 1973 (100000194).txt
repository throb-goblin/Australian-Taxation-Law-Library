          get in and hold the trust property and invest its funds and
          dispose of the assets as the managing trustees in writing
          direct, for which purpose the custodian trustee shall
          execute all such documents and perform all such acts as the
          managing trustees in writing direct; and
          (d) for the purposes of paragraph (c), a direction given by
          the majority of the managing trustees, where there are more
          than 1, shall be deemed to be given by all the managing
          trustees; and
          (e) the custodian trustee shall not be liable for acting on
          any direction to which paragraph (c) refers; but if the
          custodian trustee is of opinion that any such direction
          conflicts with the trusts or the law, or exposes the
          custodian trustee to any liability, or is otherwise
          objectionable, the custodian trustee may apply to the court
          for directions in the matter; and any order giving
          directions shall bind both the custodian trustee and the
          managing trustees; and the court may make such order as to
          costs as it thinks proper; and
          (f) the custodian trustee shall not be liable for any act
          or default on the part of any of the managing trustees; and
          (g) all actions and proceedings touching or concerning the
          trust property shall be brought or defended in the name of
          the custodian trustee at the written direction of the
          managing trustees, and the custodian trustee shall not be
          liable for the costs thereof apart from any payable out of
          the trust property; and
          (h) a person dealing with the custodian trustee shall not
          be concerned to inquire as to any direction, concurrence or
          otherwise of the managing trustees or be affected by notice
          of the fact that the managing trustees have not concurred;
          and
          (i) the power of appointing new trustees, when exercisable
          by the trustee, shall be exercisable by the managing
          trustees alone, but the custodian trustee shall have the
          same power as any other trustee of applying to the court
          for the appointment of a new trustee.
     (3) On the application of the custodian trustee or of any of the
     managing trustees or of any beneficiary and on satisfactory proof
     that it is the general wish of the beneficiaries or that on other
     grounds it is expedient to terminate the custodian trusteeship, the
     court may make an order for that purpose and may also make such
     vesting orders and give such directions as in the circumstances seem
     to the court to be necessary or expedient.

circumstances
*** 30 Loans and investments by trustees not breaches of trust in particular
circumstances ***
     (1) If a trustee lends an amount on the security of property, the

     comparison of the amount of the loan with the value of the property

          (a) if it appears to the court thatâ
               (i) in making the loan, the trustee was acting on

          borrower.
     (2) If a trustee lends an amount on the security of leasehold
     property, the trustee is not in breach of trust only because the
     trustee dispensed, either completely or in part, with the production
     or investigation of the lesseeâs title when making the loan.
     (3) This section applies to transfers of existing securities as well
     as to new securities and to investments whether made before or after

          rent, with or without a fine, premium or foregift, any of
          which if taken shall be deemed to be part of and an
          accretion to the rental, and shall, as between the persons

          1 or more terms, at a rent to be fixed or made
          ascertainable in a manner specified in the original lease
          or the original sublease, but so that the aggregate
          duration of the original and of the renewal terms shall not

     any way liable merely for postponing the sale in the exercise of the
     trusteeâs discretion for an indefinite and unlimited period,
     whether or not that period exceeds the period during which the trust
     or direction for sale remains valid; nor shall a purchaser of the

          the same trusts such sum as the trustee thinks reasonable
          by way of expenditure upon or contribution toward the
          construction and maintenance of such roads, streets, access
          ways, service lanes, and footpaths, and such sewerage,
          water, electricity, drainage and other works as are in the
          opinion of the trustee likely to be beneficial to the
          property, notwithstanding that they are intended to be
          constructed wholly or partly on land not subject to the
          same trusts and dedicate land subject to the same trusts as
          roads, streets, accessways, service lanes and footpaths
          where in the trusteeâs opinion it is likely to be
          beneficial to the property; and
          (g) subject to this Act and to any direction of the court,
          apportion any payment or expenditure made in pursuance of
          paragraphs (a) to (f) between capital and income or
          otherwise among the persons entitled thereto in such manner
          as the trustee considers equitable, with power, where the
          whole or part of the payment or expenditure is made out of
          capital moneys, to recoup capital from subsequent income,
          if that course would be equitable in all the circumstances;
          and
          (h) grant easements and profits a prendre and enter into
          party wall agreements and agreements that relate to
          fencing, and execute all necessary documents to give effect
          thereto; and
          (i) as mortgagor or mortgagee, agree to the renewal,
          extension or variation of the mortgage for such period and
          on such terms and conditions as the trustee thinks fit;
          butâ
               (i) the powers conferred by this paragraph may be
               exercised by a trustee as mortgagor for the
               purpose of raising additional money on the
               security of a mortgage of any property, where the
               trustee would have power under section 45 to
               raise money by a mortgage of the property, and
               not otherwise; and
               (ii) nothing in this paragraph authorises any
               trustee to advance money on the security of any
               mortgage that would not be an authorised
               investment in respect of the amount advanced; and
          (j) make such inquiries, by way of advertisement or
          otherwise, as the trustee thinks necessary for the purpose
          of ascertaining the next of kin or beneficiaries; and
          (k) where the property includes a life policy and there is
          no money or insufficient money available for the payment of
          premiums on the policy, surrender the policy for money or
          accept instead of the policy a fully paid-up policy or vary
          the terms of the policy in such manner as the trustee
          thinks fit; and
          (l) appropriate any part of the property in or towards
          satisfaction of any legacy payable thereout or in or
          towards satisfaction of any share of the trust property
          (whether settled, contingent or absolute) to which any
          person is entitled, and for that purpose value the whole or
          any part of the property in accordance with section 51;
          butâ
               (i) the appropriation shall not be made so as to
               affect adversely any specific gift; and
               (ii) before any such appropriation is effectual,
               notice thereof shall be given to all persons not
               under a disability who are interested in the
               appropriation, and to the parent or guardian of
               any infant who is interested in the
               appropriation, and to the person having the care
               and management of the estate of any person who is
               not of full mental capacity, and any such person
               may within 1 month after receipt of the notice
               or, upon the personâs application to the court
               within that month, within such extended period as
               the court may allow, apply to the court to vary
               the appropriation, and the appropriation shall be
               conclusive save as varied by the court; and
          (m) where provision is made in any instrument creating a
          trust for payment of an annuity or other periodic payment,
          and notwithstanding that the annuity or payment may by the
          instrument be charged upon the trust property or upon any
          part thereofâset aside and appropriate out of property
          available for payment of the annuity and invest a sum
          sufficient in the opinion of the trustee at the time of
          appropriation to provide out of the income thereof the
          amount required to pay the annuity or periodic payment, and
          so that after the appropriation shall have been madeâ
               (i) the annuitant shall have the same right of
               recourse to the capital and income of the
               appropriated sum as the annuitant would have had
               against the trust property if no appropriation
               had been made; and
               (ii) the trustee may forthwith distribute the
               residue of the trust property and the income
               thereof (which residue and income shall no longer
               be liable for the annuity) in accordance with the
               trusts declared of and concerning the same; and
          (n) do or omit all acts and things, and execute all
          instruments necessary to carry into effect the powers and
          authorities given by this Act or by or under the instrument
          creating the trust.
     (2) Nothing in subsection (1) (l) shall be read as requiring a
     trustee to give to himself or herself, in some other capacity, notice
     of an appropriation; but, where a trustee would, but for this
     subsection, be obliged to give to himself or herself such a notice,
     the appropriation is not effectual until it has been approved by all
     the beneficiaries being persons not under a disability, or by the
     court on the ex parte application of the trustee or otherwise.
     (3) Any notice which is to be served in accordance with subsection
     (1) (l) may be servedâ
          (a) by delivering it to the person for whom it is intended
          or by sending it by prepaid registered letter addressed to
          that person at the personâs usual or last known place of
          abode or business; or
          (b) in such other manner as may be directed by the court.
     (4) Where a notice is sent by post as provided by this section, it
     shall be deemed to be served at the time at which the letter would
     have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.
     (5) Where a trustee desires to distribute, under the provisions of
     subsection (1) (m) (ii), any land subject to the provisions of the
     Land Title Act 1994, or any other Act, the trustee shall in writing
     notify the registrar or other person (if any) having the duty or
     function of registering or recording dealings under such Act, that
     the land is, by reason of an appropriation made in pursuance of
     subsection (1) (m) (ii), distributable, and the registrar or such
     other person shall not be concerned to make any inquiry as to the
     sufficiency of the appropriated sum.
Power of trustee to sell by auction etc.
*** 34 Power of trustee to sell by auction etc. ***
     (1) A trustee may sell or concur with any other person in selling all
     or any part of the trust property, either subject to prior
     encumbrances or not, and either together or in lots, by public
     auction, by public tender or by private contract, subject to any such
     conditions respecting title or evidence of title or other matters as
     the trustee thinks fit, with power to vary any contract for sale, and
     to buy in at any auction, or to rescind any contract for sale and to
     resell, without being answerable for any loss.
     (2) A trust or power to sell or dispose of land includes a trust or
     power to sell or dispose of part thereof, whether the division is
     horizontal, vertical or made in any other way; and also includes a
     trust or power to sell or dispose of any building, fixture, timber or
     other thing affixed to the soil apart and separately from the land
     itself.
     (3) If a trustee joins with any other person in selling trust
     property and other property, the purchase money shall be apportioned
     in or before the contract of sale, and a separate receipt shall be
     given by the trustee for the apportioned share; but a contravention
     of this subsection does not invalidate and shall not be deemed to
     have invalidated any instrument intended to affect or evidence the
     title to the trust property, and no person being a purchaser, lessee,
     mortgagee, or other person who, in good faith and for valuable
     consideration, acquires the trust property or an interest in it or a
     charge over it, and neither the registrar of titles nor any other
     person registering or certifying title, shall be affected by notice
     of, or be concerned to inquire whether there has been, a
     contravention of this subsection.
Power to sell subject to depreciatory conditions
*** 35 Power to sell subject to depreciatory conditions ***
     (1) A sale by a trustee shall not be impeached by any beneficiary
     upon the ground that any of the conditions subject to which the sale
     was made may have been unnecessarily depreciatory, unless it also
     appears that the consideration for the sale was thereby rendered
     inadequate.
     (2) A sale by a trustee shall not, after the execution of the
     conveyance or transfer, be impeached as against the purchaser, upon
     the ground that any of the conditions subject to which the sale was
     made may have been unnecessarily depreciatory, unless it appears that
     the purchaser was acting in collusion with the trustee at the time
     when the contract for sale was made.
     (3) A purchaser, upon any sale by a trustee, shall not be at liberty
     to make any objection against the title upon any of the grounds in
     this section mentioned.
Mortgage on sale of land
*** 36 Mortgage on sale of land ***
     (1) Where a trustee sells land for an estate in fee simple, the
     trustee may, where the proceeds are liable to be invested, contract
     that the payment of any part, not exceeding two-thirds of the
     purchase money shall be secured by a first legal or first statutory
     mortgage of the land sold, with or without the security of any other
     property, and the mortgage shall, if any buildings or other
     improvements are comprised in the mortgage, contain a covenant by the
     mortgagor to keep them insured against loss or damage by fire and by
     storm and tempest to their full insurable value.
     (2) The trustee shall not be bound to obtain any report as to the
     value of the land or other property to be comprised in such a
     mortgage as is mentioned in subsection (1), or any advice as to the
     making of the loan, and shall not be liable for any loss that may be
     incurred by reason only of the security being insufficient at the
     date of the mortgage.
     (3) Where the sale referred to in subsection (1) is made under the
     order of the court, the powers conferred by that subsection shall
     apply only if and so far as the court may by order direct.
Deferred payment on sale of property
*** 37 Deferred payment on sale of property ***
     (1) A sale of property by a trustee, in exercise of any power vested
     in the trustee in that behalf by the instrument creating the trust or
     by or under this Act or any other enactment, may be on terms of
     deferred payment.
     (2) The terms of deferred payment may provide that the purchase money
     and interest (if any) shall be paid by instalments.
     (3) The terms upon which property is sold shall, in addition to such
     other provisions as the trustee may think proper, include provisions
     giving effect to the following, namely thatâ
          (a) the part of the purchase money to be paid by deposit
          shall not be less than the sum which a person acting with
          prudence would, if the property were the personâs own,
          have accepted in the circumstances in order to sell the
          property to the best advantage, and in any case shall not
          be less than one-tenth of the purchase money;
          (b) the balance of the purchase money shall be payable by
          such instalments and shall bear interest payable half-
          yearly or oftener on the amount from time to time unpaid at
          such rate as a person acting with prudence would, if the
          property were the personâs own, have accepted in the
          circumstances in order to sell the property to the best
          advantage, and in any case the whole purchase money shall
          be payable within a period not exceeding 10 years from the
          date of sale;
          (c) if any instalment or interest or part thereof is in
          arrear and unpaid for 6 months, or for such less period as
          may be specified, the whole of the purchase money shall
          become due and payable;
          (d) the purchaser shall maintain and protect the property,
          and, in the case of land, keep all buildings (if any)
          thereon insured against loss or damage by fire and by storm
          and tempest to their full insurable value.
     (4) Notwithstanding that the property has been sold on terms of
     deferred payment, the trustee may, at any time after one-third of the
     purchase money has been paid, convey the property and take a mortgage
     to secure payment of the balance of the purchase money and interest,
     with or without the security of any other property.
     (5) Whether the sale is made under the order of the court or
     otherwise, the court may make such order as it thinks fit as to the
     terms of deferred payment.
     (6) A trustee selling property on terms authorised by this section or
     by any order of the court shall not be affected by section 30 in
     respect of so much of the purchase money as is payable under an
     agreement for sale or is secured by a mortgage, and shall not be
     liable for any loss that may be incurred by reason only of the
     security being insufficient at the date of the agreement or mortgage.
     (7) For the purposes of any consent or direction required by the
     instrument (if any) creating the trust or by statute, a trustee
     selling property on terms of deferred payment shall be deemed not to
     be lending money or investing trust funds.
Surrender of onerous leases or property
*** 38 Surrender of onerous leases or property ***
     (1) Where a leasehold is vested in a trustee and the property is
     subject to onerous covenants of such a nature that it would not be in
     the interests of the beneficiaries to retain the property, the
     trustee may surrender, or concur in surrendering, the lease; and the
     trustee shall not be chargeable with breach of trust nor shall the
     surrender be impeached by any beneficiary upon the ground only that
     the covenants were not of such a nature, if the trustee has acted
     bona fide and on the advice of a registered valuer, whom the trustee
     reasonably believed to be competent, instructed and employed
     independently of the lessor, whether the valuer carried on business
     in the locality where the property is situate or elsewhere.
     (2) Where a freehold is vested in a trustee and the property is of so
     onerous a nature that it would not be in the interests of the
     beneficiaries to retain the property, if the Crown agrees to accept
     the surrender of the freehold, the trustee may surrender, or concur
     in surrendering, it to the Crown; and the trustee shall not be
     chargeable with breach of trust nor shall the surrender be impeached
     by any beneficiary upon the ground only that the property was not of
     such a nature, if the trustee has acted bona fide and on the advice
     of a registered valuer, whom the trustee reasonably believed to be
     competent, whether that valuer carried on business in the locality
     where the property is situate or elsewhere.
     (3) A subsequent purchaser or the registrar or other person
     registering or certifying title shall not be concerned to inquire
     whether a surrender was authorised by this section.
Power to renew leases
*** 39 Power to renew leases ***
     (1) A trustee of any leasehold for life or lives or years which is
     renewable under any covenant or contract or by custom or usual
     practice may, if the trustee thinks fit, and shall, if thereto
     required by any person having any beneficial interest, present or
     future or contingent, in the leasehold, use the trusteeâs best
     endeavours to obtain from time to time a renewed lease of the same
     hereditaments on the agreed or reasonable terms, and for that purpose
     may from time to time make or concur in making a surrender of the
     lease for the time being subsisting, and do all such other acts as
     are requisite; but where, by the terms of the instrument (if any)
     creating the trust, the person in possession for the personâs life
     or other limited interest is entitled to enjoy the same without any
     obligation to renew, or to contribute to the expense of renewal, this
     section does not apply unless the consent in writing of that person
     is obtained to the renewal.
     (2) A trustee obtaining a renewal of a lease under the powers
     conferred by this section or otherwise may pay or apply capital money
     subject to the trust, for the purpose of obtaining the renewal.

A trustee may, in lieu of proceeding to foreclosure, purchase the equity of
redemption of land the subject of a mortgage held by the trustee under which
default has been made where the moneys expended in that purchase are subject to
the same trusts as the mortgage debt; but in no case shall the moneys paid by
way of consideration for such purchase exceed 5% of the amount due under the
mortgage.
Release of equity of redemption in discharge of mortgage debt
*** 41 Release of equity of redemption in discharge of mortgage debt ***
     (1) Where an equity of redemption is vested in a trustee and the
     mortgaged property is not of greater value than the amount of the
     mortgage debt, the trustee may release the equity of redemption to
     the mortgagee in discharge of the mortgage debt or part thereof; and
     the trustee shall not be chargeable with breach of trust nor shall
     the release be impeached by any beneficiary upon the ground only that
     the mortgaged property was of greater value than the amount of the
     mortgage debt or of the part thereof discharged, if the trustee has
     acted bona fide and on the advice of a registered valuer, whom the
     trustee reasonably believed to be competent, instructed and employed
     independently of the mortgagee, whether the valuer carried on
     business in the locality where the property is situate or elsewhere.
     (2) A subsequent purchaser or the registrar or other person
     registering or certifying title shall not be concerned to inquire
     whether a release was authorised by this section.
Application of income by trustee-mortgagee in possession
*** 42 Application of income by trustee-mortgagee in possession ***
     (1) Where a trustee is entitled, whether severally or as a co-
     mortgagee, to a debt secured by a mortgage of land in trust as to the
     whole or part of that debt for persons by way of succession, and the
     trustee is at the date of commencement of this Act, or at any time
     after that date becomes, mortgagee in possession of the mortgaged
     land, the trustee shall apply the net income of the mortgaged land
     received by the trustee after that date or after the trustee becomes
     mortgagee in possessionâ
          (a) in discharge of all rents, taxes, rates, and outgoings
          affecting the mortgaged land; and
          (b) in payment of the premiums on any insurances properly
          payable on the mortgaged property; and
          (c) in keeping down all annual sums or other payments and
          the interest on all principal sums having priority to the
          mortgage in right whereof the trustee is in possession;
     and subject to the rights of the mortgagor, the trustee shall hold
     the residue of the income so received by the trustee upon the trusts
     to which the mortgage debt is subject.
     (2) The rents, taxes, outgoings, premiums, costs, annual sums,
     payments and interest to be discharged, kept down and paid, pursuant
     to subsection (1), shall be those accruing dueâ
          (a) after the date of the commencement of this Act, where
          the trustee is in possession of the mortgaged land at that
          date; and
          (b) after the date of possession by the trustee, where the
          entry into possession is after the date of commencement of
          this Act;
     but if at the date of commencement of this Act, or on the date of
     possession by the trustee, as the case may be, any rents, taxes,
     rates, outgoings, annual sums, payments, interest or premiums
     mentioned in subsection (1) (a) to (c) were or are due and unpaid,
     and such of those rents, taxes, rates, outgoings, annual sums,
     payments, and premiums as are periodic payments were payable wholly
     or in part in respect of any period subsequent to the date of
     commencement or to the date of possession, as the case may be, then
     the lastmentioned rents, taxes, rates, outgoings, annual sums,
     payments, and premiums shall, for the purpose of this section, be
     considered as accruing from day to day and shall be apportionable in
     respect of time accordingly.
     (3) On the recovery of the moneys secured by the mortgage, whether in
     whole or in part, and whether by repayment or on realisation of the
     security or otherwise, such part of the income applied by the trustee
     in the payments specified in subsection (1) (a) to (c) as would
     otherwise have been payable as interest to the person entitled to the
     interest of the mortgage debt shall, as between the persons
     respectively entitled to the income and corpus of the mortgage debt,
     be deemed to be arrears of interest payable without interest thereon
     and the amount received by the trustee shall be apportioned
     accordingly.
     (4) Notwithstanding anything in this section contained, the trustee
     may, if in the administration of the trust the trustee thinks it
     necessary so to do, apply income of the mortgaged property received
     by the trustee after the date of commencement of this Act in payment
     of any rents, taxes, rates, outgoings, premiums, costs, annual sums,
     payments and interest, affecting the mortgaged land other than those
     specified in subsection (2); but the person entitled to the interest
     on the mortgage debt shall be entitled to recoupment out of the
     capital of the mortgage debt of all payments made by the trustee
     under the authority conferred by this subsection.
Power of trustee to give receipts

any 1 or more of such trustees thereto respectively authorised by the trustees
in writing, for any money, securities, or other personal property or effects,
payable, transferable, or deliverable to the trustee or them, as the case may
be, under any trust or power is a sufficient discharge for the same, and
effectually exonerates the person paying, transferring, or delivering the same
from seeing to the application or being answerable for any loss or
misapplication thereof.
Power to compound liabilities

A trustee may, if and as the trustee thinks fitâ

things as to the trustee seem expedient, without being responsible for any loss
occasioned by any act or thing so done by the trustee in good faith.

money subject to the trust for any purpose or in any manner, the trustee has
and shall be deemed always to have had power to raise the money required by
sale, conversion, calling in or mortgage of all or any part of the trust
property for the time being in possession; and where a trustee, in the exercise
of the trusteeâs powers in that behalf, purchases any property for the trust,
the trustee has and shall be deemed always to have had power to make the
purchase on terms of deferred payment or on mortgage of that property.
Protection to purchasers and mortgagees dealing with trustees

     (1) A trustee may insure against loss or damage, whether by fire or
     otherwise, any insurable property, and against any risk or liability
     against which it would be prudent for a person to insure if the
     person were acting for himself or herself.
     (2) The insurance may be for any amount, provided that, together with
     the amount of any insurance already on foot, the total shall not
     exceed the insurable value or liability.
     (3) Subject to any direction expressed in the instrument (if any)
     creating the trust or to any direction of the court, the trustee may,
     as the trustee thinks fit, pay the premiums out ofâ
          (a) the income of the property concerned; or
          (b) the income of any other property subject to the same
          trusts; or
          (c) any capital money subject to the same trusts; or
          (d) any 1 or more of paragraphs (a) to (c) in such
          proportions as the trustee considers equitable.
Application of insurance money
*** 48 Application of insurance money ***
     (1) Where a policy of insurance against the loss or damage of any
     property subject to a trust, whether by fire or otherwise, has been
     kept up under any trust in that behalf, or under any power statutory
     or otherwise, or in performance of any obligation statutory or
     otherwise, the money receivable by a trustee under the policy shall
     be capital money for the purposes of the trust.
     (2) The money receivable shall be held upon trusts corresponding as
     nearly as may be with the trusts affecting the property in respect of
     which it was payable.
     (3) The money receivable or any part thereof may also be applied by
     the trustee or, if in court, under the direction of the court, in
     rebuilding, reinstating, replacing, or repairing the property lost or
     damaged.
     (4) Any application by the trustees under subsection (3) shall be
     subject to the consent of any person whose consent is required by the
     instrument (if any) creating the trust to the investment of money
     subject to the trust.

     any person to require the money or any part thereof to be applied in
     rebuilding, reinstating or repairing the property lost or damaged.

     any mortgagee lessor or lessee, whether under any statute or
     otherwise.
     (7) This section applies only if and as far as a contrary intention
     is not expressed in the instrument (if any) creating the trust, and
     shall have effect subject to the terms of that instrument and to the
     provisions therein contained.

     effected either before or after the commencement of this Act, but
     only to money received after the commencement of this Act.

A trustee may deposit any document held by the trustee relating to the trust,
or to the trust property, with any financial institution or corporation whose

trust property, and so far as there is no available income out of the capital
of the trust property.
Reversionary interests
*** 50 Reversionary interests ***
     (1) Where trust property includes any share or interest in property
     not vested in the trustee, or the proceeds of sale of any such
     property, or any other thing in action, the trustee, on its or their
     falling into possession or becoming payable or transferable, mayâ
          (a) agree or ascertain the amount or value thereof or any
          part thereof in such manner as the trustee thinks fit; and
          (b) accept in or towards satisfaction thereof, at the
          market or current value, or upon any valuation or estimate
          of value that the trustee may think fit, any authorised
          investments; and
          (c) allow any deductions for duties, costs, charges, and
          expenses that the trustee thinks proper or reasonable; and
          (d) execute any release in respect thereof, so as
          effectually to discharge all accountable parties from all
          liability in respect of any matter coming within the scope
          of the release, without being responsible for any loss
          occasioned by any act or thing so done by the trustee in
          good faith.
     (2) The trustee shall not be under any obligation and shall not be
     chargeable with any breach of trust by reason of any omissionâ
          (a) to give any notice in respect of, or apply for any
          charging or other like order upon, any securities or other
          property out of or on which the share or interest or other
          thing in action mentioned in subsection (1) is derived,
          payable or charged; or
          (b) to take any proceedings on account of any act, default
          or neglect on the part of the persons in whom the
          securities or other property mentioned in paragraph (a) or
          any of them or any part of them are for the time being, or
          had at any time been, vested;
     unless and until required in writing so to do by some person, or the
     guardian of some person, beneficially interested under the trust, and
     unless also due provision is made to the trusteeâs satisfaction for
     payment of the costs of any proceedings required to be taken.
     (3) Nothing in subsection (2) relieves the trustee of the obligation
     to get in and obtain payment or transfer of the share or interest or
     other thing in action upon its falling into possession.
Valuations
*** 51 Valuations ***
     (1) A trustee may, for the purpose of giving effect to the trust, or
     any of the provisions of the instrument (if any) creating the trust
     or of this Act or any other Act from time to time ascertain and fix
     the value of any trust property, or of any property which the trustee
     is authorised to purchase or otherwise acquire, in such manner as the
     trustee thinks proper; and where the trustee is not personally
     qualified to ascertain the value of any property the trustee shall
     consult a duly qualified person (whether employed by the trustee or
     not) as to that value; but the trustee shall not be bound to accept
     any valuation made by any person whom the trustee may consult.
     (2) Any valuation made by the trustee in good faith under this
     section is binding on all persons beneficially interested under the
     trust.
Audit
*** 52 Audit ***
     (1) A trustee may, in the trusteeâs absolute discretion, from time
     to time, cause the accounts of the trust property to be examined or
     audited by a public accountant, and shall for that purpose produce
     such vouchers and give such information to that person as the trustee
     may require.
     (2) The costs of the examination or audit, including the fee of the
     person making the examination or audit, shall be charged against the
     capital or income of the trust property, or partly in 1 way and
     partly in the other, as the trustee may in the trusteeâs absolute
     discretion think fit, but, in default of any direction by the trustee
     to the contrary in any special case, costs attributable to capital
     shall be borne by capital and those attributable to income by income.
     (3) Where the trustee or 1 of the trustees is the public trustee or a
     trustee corporation, nothing in this section authorises, except in
     the case of a business forming part of the trust property, any costs
     or fee to be paid out of, or borne by, the capital or income of the
     trust property, unless the court approves of the costs or fee being
     so paid out or borne.
Power to concur with others
*** 53 Power to concur with others ***
Where trust property includes an undivided share in any property, the trustee
may (without prejudice to any trust or power in relation to the entirety of the
property) execute or exercise any trust or power vested in the trustee in
relation to that share in conjunction with the persons entitled to, or having
power in that behalf over, the other share or shares, and notwithstanding that
the trustee or any 1 or more of several trustees may be entitled to or
interested in any such share, either in his, her or their own right or in a
fiduciary capacity.
Power to employ agents
*** 54 Power to employ agents ***
     (1) A trustee may, instead of acting personally, employ and pay an
     agent, whether a solicitor, accountant, financial institution,
     trustee corporation, financial services licensee, regulated principal
     or other person, to transact any business or do any act required to
     be transacted or done in the execution of the trust or the
     administration of the trust property, including the receipt and
     payment of money, and the keeping and audit of trust accounts, and
     shall be entitled to be allowed and paid all charges and expenses so
     incurred, and shall not be responsible for the default of any such
     agent employed in good faith and without negligence.
     (2) A trustee may appoint any person to act as the trusteeâs agent
     or attorney for the purpose of selling, converting, collecting,
     getting in, and executing and perfecting assurances of, or managing
     or cultivating, or otherwise administering any property real or
     personal, movable or immovable, subject to the trust in any place
     outside the State, or executing or exercising any discretion or trust
     or power vested in the trustee in relation to any such property, with
     such ancillary powers, and with and subject to such provisions and
     restrictions, as the trustee may think fit, including a power to
     appoint substitutes, and shall not, by reason only of the trustee
     having made any such appointment, be responsible for any loss arising
     thereby.
     (3) Without limiting the generality of the powers conferred by
     subsections (1) and (2), a trustee mayâ
          (a) appoint a solicitor to be the trusteeâs agent to
          receive and give a discharge for any money or valuable
          consideration or property receivable by the trustee under
          the trust, by permitting the solicitor to have the custody
          of, and to produce, a deed or instrument having in the body
          thereof or endorsed thereon a receipt for the money or
          valuable consideration or property, the deed or instrument
          being executed, or the endorsed receipt being signed, by
          the person entitled to give a receipt for that
          consideration; or
          (b) appoint a financial institution or solicitor to be the
          trusteeâs agent to receive and give a discharge for any
          money payable to the trustee under or by virtue of a policy
          of insurance, by permitting the financial institution or
          solicitor to have the custody of and to produce the policy
          of insurance with a receipt signed by the trustee;
     and the production, by the solicitor, of any such deed or instrument
     as is mentioned in paragraph (a) shall have the same validity and
     effect as if the person appointing the solicitor had not been a
     trustee.
     (4) A trustee shall not be chargeable with a breach of trust, by
     reason only of the trustee having made, or concurred in making, any
     appointment such as is mentioned in subsection (3); but nothing in
     that subsection exempts a trustee from any liability that the trustee
     would have incurred if this Act and any enactment replaced by this
     Act had not been passed, where the trustee permits any money,
     valuable consideration or property therein mentioned to remain in the
     hands or under the control of the financial institution or solicitor
     for a longer period than is reasonably necessary to enable the
     financial institution or solicitor, as the case may be, to pay or
     transfer it to the trustee.
     (5) Subsections (3) and (4) apply whether the money or valuable
     consideration or property was or is received before or after the
     commencement of this Act.
     (6) In this sectionâ
     "financial services licensee" means a financial services licensee,
     defined under the Corporations Act, section 761A, whose licence
     covers dealing in, or providing advice about, securities.
     "regulated principal" means a regulated principalâ
          (a) defined under the Corporations Act, section 1430; and
          (b) dealing in, or providing advice about, securities as
          authorised by the Corporations Act, part 10.2, division 1,
          subdivision D.
Protection of financial institutions
*** 55 Protection of financial institutions ***
     (1) Where there are 2 or more trustees of a trust and the trustees by
     writing under their hands authorise a financial institutionâ
          (a) to pay bills of exchange drawn upon the financial
          institution account of the trustees by the trustee or
          trustees named in that behalf in the authority; or
          (b) to recognise as a valid endorsement upon any bill of
          exchange payable to the order of the trustees the
          endorsement thereon by the trustee or trustees named in
          that behalf in the authority; or
          (c) to pay money out of any account of the trust in a
          financial institution, on presentation of withdrawal forms
          signed in the manner specified in the authority;
     the financial institution acting in pursuance of that authority shall
     not be deemed privy to a breach of trust on the ground only of notice
     that the persons giving the authority were trustees, or that the
     instrument (if any) by which the trust was created did not contain
     any express power to give such an authority.
     (2) The protection afforded to financial institutions by subsection
     (1) does not apply in the case of anything done by a financial
     institution, in pursuance of an authority given under that
     subsection, after the financial institution has received notice in
     writing of the revocation, by death or otherwise, of the authority.
     (3) This section does not affect any question of the liability of any
     trustee for breach of trust in authorising a financial institution as
     provided by subsection (1).
     (4) Nothing in this section or in any rule of law prevents trustees
     opening an account named an imprest account at a financial
     institution and authorising any 1 or more of their number or any
     other person or persons to operate upon the imprest account.
     (5) In this sectionâ
     "bill of exchange" has the same meaning as in the Bills of Exchange
     Act 1909 (Cwlth).
Power to delegate trusts
*** 56 Power to delegate trusts ***
     (1) A trustee who for the time being is out of the State or is about
     to depart therefrom, or who is, or may be about to become, by reason
     of physical infirmity, temporarily incapable of performing all duties
     as a trustee may, subject to the provisions of this section, and
     notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, by power
     of attorney, delegate to any person resident in the State the
     execution or exercise during the trusteeâs absence from the State
     or during the trusteeâs incapacity, as the case may be, of all or
     any trusts, powers, authorities, and discretions vested in the
     trustee as such trustee, whether alone or jointly with any other
     person or persons; but a person being the only other co-trustee and
     not being a trustee corporation shall not be appointed to be an
     attorney under this subsection.
     (2) Where any delegation has under this section been duly made to and
     accepted by any person and is for the time being in operation, that
     person has, within the scope of the delegation, the same trusts,
     powers, authorities, discretions, liabilities, and responsibilities
     (except the power of delegation conferred by this section) as the
     person would have if the person were then the trustee.
     (3) Every trustee shall be liable for the acts and defaults of every
     such delegate as if they were the trusteeâs own acts and defaults.
     (4) All jurisdictions and powers of any court apply to the donee of a
     power of attorney given under this section in the same manner, so far
     as respects the execution of the trust or the administration of the
     estate to which the power of attorney relates, as if the donee were
     acting in relation to the trust or estate in the same capacity as the
     donor of the power.
     (5) A power of attorney given under this section does not come into
     operation unless and until the donor is out of the State or is
     incapable of performing all the donorâs duties as a trustee, and is
     revoked by the donorâs return or by the donorâs recovery of that
     capacity, as the case may be.
     (6) In favour of any person dealing with the donee of a power of
     attorney given under this section, any act done or instrument
     executed by the donee, is, notwithstanding that the power has never
     come into operation or has been revoked, whether by the act of the
     donor of the power or by operation of law, as valid and effectual as
     if the power had come into operation and remained unrevoked at the
     time when the act was done or the instrument executed, unless that
     person had at that time actual notice that the power had never come
     into operation or of the revocation of the power.
     (7) A statutory declaration by the donee of a power of attorney given
     under this section relating to any trust or estate that the power has
     come into operation or that in any transaction the donee is acting in
     the execution of the trust or the administration of the estate, is,
     in favour of a person dealing with the donee of the power, conclusive
     evidence of that fact.
     (8) The fact that it appears from any power of attorney given under
     this section, or from any evidence required for the purposes of any
     power of attorney or otherwise, that in any transaction the donee of
     the power is acting in the execution of a trust shall not affect with
     notice of the trust any person dealing in good faith with the donee.
Power to carry on business
*** 57 Power to carry on business ***
     (1) Subject to the provisions of any other Act and of the instrument
     (if any) creating the trust, where at the commencement of the trust
     the trust property or any part of it was being used by the settlor in
     carrying on any business, whether alone or in partnership, the
     trustee may continue to carry on that business for any 1 or more of
     the following periods, namelyâ
          (a) 2 years from the commencement of the trust;
          (b) such period as may be necessary for the winding-up of
          the business;
          (c) such further period or periods as the court may
          approve.
     (2) In the exercise of the powers conferred by this section or by the
     instrument (if any) creating the trust, a trustee mayâ
          (a) employ any part of the trust property which is subject
          to the same trusts; and
          (b) from time to time increase or diminish the part of the
          trust property employed as provided by paragraph (a); and
          (c) purchase stock, machinery, implements, and chattels for
          the purpose of the business referred to in subsection (1);
          and
          (d) employ such managers, agents, employees, clerks,
          workers and others as the trustee thinks fit; and
          (e) at any time enter into a partnership agreement to take
          the place of any partnership agreement subsisting
          immediately before the commencement of the trust or at any
          time thereafter and notwithstanding that the trustee was a
          partner of the settlor in the trusteeâs own right; and
          (f) enter into sharefarming agreements.
     (3) Application to the court for leave to carry on a business may be
     made by the trustee or any person beneficially interested in the
     estate at any time, whether the business has been carried on before
     or after the commencement of this Act and whether or not any previous
     authority to carry on the business has expired; and the court may
     make such an order, and may make such order retrospective to any
     particular date, or may order that the business be not carried on, or
     be carried on subject to conditions, or may make such other order as,
     in the circumstances, it thinks fit.
     (4) Nothing in this section affects any other authority to do the
     acts thereby authorised to be done.
     (5) Where a trustee is in any manner interested or concerned in a
     trade or business, the trustee may make such subscriptions as it
     would be prudent for the trustee to make, if the trustee were acting
     for himself or herself, out of the income of the assets affected, to
     any fund created for objects or purposes in support of any trade or
     business of a like nature and subscribed to by other persons engaged
     in a like trade or business.
Power to convert business into a company
*** 58 Power to convert business into a company ***
     (1) Subject to the provisions of the instrument (if any) creating the
     trust, a trustee may at any time, at the expense of the trust
     property, convert or join in converting any business into a company
     limited by shares in such manner, as the trustee thinks fit; and may,
     at the like expense, promote and assist in promoting a company for
     taking over the business; and may sell or transfer the business and
     the capital and assets and goodwill thereof, or any part thereof to
     the company, or to any company having for its objects the purchase of
     such a business, in consideration, in either case, wholly or in part
     of ordinary or preference shares wholly or partially paid up of any
     such company, or wholly or in part of debentures, debenture stock, or
     bonds of any such company, and as to the balance (if any) in cash
     payable immediately, or by any instalments with or without security.
     (2) A trustee may retain as an authorised investment of the trust any
     shares, debentures, debenture stock or bonds received by the trustee
     in consequence of the exercise by the trustee of any power conferred
     by subsection (1).
Trustee may sue himself or herself in a different capacity
*** 59 Trustee may sue himself or herself in a different capacity ***
Notwithstanding any rule of law or practice to the contrary, a trustee of any
property in that capacity may sue, and be sued by, himself or herself in any
other capacity whatsoever, including the trusteeâs personal capacity; but in
every such case the trustee shall obtain the directions of the court in which
the proceedings are taken as to the manner in which differing interests are to
be represented.
Application of part
*** 60 Application of part ***
The provisions of this part shall apply whether or not a contrary intention is
expressed in the instrument (if any) creating the trust.
Power to apply income for maintenance etc. and to accumulate surplus income
during a minority
*** 61 Power to apply income for maintenance etc. and to accumulate surplus
income during a minority ***
     (1) When any property is held by trustees in trust, whether
     absolutely or contingently for a beneficiary who is an infant, the
     trustee may, at the trusteeâs absolute discretion, pay to the
     infantâs parent or guardian (if any) or otherwise apply for or
     towards the infantâs maintenance, education (including past
     maintenance or education) advancement or benefit, the income of that
     property or any part thereof, whether there is any other fund
     applicable to the same purpose, or any person bound by law to provide
     for the infantâs maintenance or education or not.
     (2) During the infancy of any such person, if the personâs interest
     so long continues, the trustee shall accumulate all the residue of
     that income in the way of compound interest by investing the same and
     the resulting income thereof from time to time in authorised
     investments, and shall hold those accumulations as followsâ
          (a) if any such personâ
               (i) attains full age, or marries under that age,
               and the personâs interest in such income during
               the personâs infancy or until the personâs
               marriage is a vested interest; or
               (ii) on attaining full age or on marriage under
               that age becomes entitled to the property from
               which income arose in fee simple, absolute or
               determinable, or absolutely, or for an entailed
               interest;
          the trustee shall hold the accumulations in trust for such
          person absolutely, but without prejudice to any provision
          with respect thereto contained in any settlement by him or
          her made under any statutory powers during the personâs
          infancy, and so that the receipt of such person after
          marriage, and though still an infant, shall be a good
          discharge;
          (b) in any other caseâthe trustee shall, notwithstanding
          that such person had a vested interest in such income, hold
          the accumulations as an accretion to the capital of the
          property from which such accumulations arose, and as 1 fund
          with such capital for all purposes;
     but the trustee may, at any time during the infancy of such person if
     the personâs interest so long continues, apply those accumulations,
     or any part thereof, as if they were income arising in the then
     current year.
     (3) Where any property is held by a trustee in trust for a
     beneficiary of full age who has a contingent interest in that
     property, the trustee may, at the trusteeâs sole discretion, pay to
     such beneficiary or otherwise apply for or towards the
     beneficiaryâs maintenance, education (including past maintenance or
     education) advancement or benefit, the income of that property or any
     part thereof.
     (4) This section shall apply in the case of a contingent interest
     only if the limitation or trust carries the intermediate income of
     the property, but it applies to a future or contingent legacy by the
     parent of, or a person standing in loco parentis to, the legatee, if
     and for such period as, under the general law, the legacy carries
     interest for the maintenance of the legatee, and in any such case as
     last aforesaid the rate of interest shall (if the income available is
     sufficient, and subject to any rules of court to the contrary) be 4%
     per annum; and where in the case of a contingent interest the
     limitation or trust would, but for the operation of a protective
     trust (whether created or statutory) carry the intermediate income of
     the property, that limitation or trust shall for the purposes of this
     subsection be deemed notwithstanding the protective trust to carry
     the intermediate income.
     (5) This section applies to a vested annuity in like manner as if the
     annuity were the income of property held by a trustee in trust to pay
     the income thereof to the annuitant for the same period for which the
     annuity is payable, save that in any case accumulations made during
     the infancy of the annuitant shall be held in trust for the annuitant
     or the annuitantâs personal representative absolutely.
     (6) This section does not apply where the instrument (if any) under
     which the interest arises came into operation before the commencement
     of this Act.
     (7) The provisions of subsection (2) do not apply where, and to the
     extent that, a contrary intention is expressed in the trust
     instrument (if any).
Power to apply capital for advancement etc.
*** 62 Power to apply capital for advancement etc. ***
     (1) Where under a trust a person is entitled to the capital of the
     trust property or any share thereof, the trustee, in such manner as
     the trustee in the trusteeâs absolute discretion thinks fit, may
     from time to time out of that capital pay or apply for the
     maintenance, education (including past maintenance or education),
     advancement or benefit of that person, an amount not exceeding in all
     $2,000 or one-half that capital (whichever is the greater) or with
     the consent of the court an amount greater than that amount.
     (2) The power conferred by this section may be exercised whether the
     person is entitled absolutely or contingently on the person attaining
     any specified age or on the occurrence of any other event, and
     notwithstanding that the interest of the person so entitled is liable
     to be defeated by the exercise of a power of appointment or
     revocation, or to be diminished by the increase of the class to which
     the person belongs.
     (3) The power conferred by this section may be exercised whether the
     person is so entitled in possession or in remainder or in reversion.
     (4) Any money so paid or applied shall be brought into account as
     part of the share in the trust property to which the person is or
     becomes absolutely or indefeasibly entitled.
     (5) No payment or application pursuant to this section shall be made
     so as to prejudice any person entitled to any prior life or other
     interest whether vested or contingent, in the money paid or applied
     unless that person is in existence and of full age and consents in
     writing to the payment or application, or unless the court, on the
     application of the trustee, so orders.
     (6) For the purposes of this section the trustee may raise money by
     sale, mortgage or exchange of the trust property.
Conditional advances for maintenance etc.
*** 63 Conditional advances for maintenance etc. ***
     (1) Where a power to pay or apply any property for the maintenance,
     education, advancement, or benefit of any person, or for any 1 or
     more of those purposes, is vested in a trustee, the trustee when
     exercising the power shall have authority to impose on the person any
     condition, whether as to repayment, payment of interest, giving
     security, or otherwise; and at any time after imposing any such
     condition, the trustee may, either wholly or in part, waive the
     condition or release any obligation undertaken or any security given
     by reason of the condition.
     (2) In determining the amount or value of the property that a trustee
     who has imposed a condition pursuant to subsection (1), may pay or
     apply in exercise of the power, any money repaid to the trustee or
     recovered by the trustee shall be deemed not to have been so paid or
     applied by the trustee.
     (3) Nothing in this section shall impose upon a trustee any
     obligation to impose any condition pursuant to subsection (1); and a
     trustee, when imposing any condition as to giving security, shall not
     be affected by any restrictions upon the investment of trust funds,
     whether imposed by this Act or by any rule of law or by the trust
     instrument (if any).
     (4) A trustee shall not be liable for any loss which may be incurred
     in respect of any money that is paid or applied under this section,
     whether the loss arises through failure to take security, or through
     the security being insufficient, or through failure to take action
     for its protection, or through the release or abandonment of the
     security without payment, or from any other cause.
Protective trusts
*** 64 Protective trusts ***
     (1) Where any income, including an annuity or other periodical income
     payment, is directed to be held on protective trusts for the benefit
     of any person (
     "the principal beneficiary") for the period of the principal
     beneficiaryâs life or for any less period, then, during that period
     (the
     "trust period") the income shall, without prejudice to any prior
     interest, be held on the following trusts, namelyâ
          (a) upon trust for the principal beneficiary during the
          trust period or until the principal beneficiary, whether
          before or after the termination of any prior interest, does
          or attempts to do or suffers any act or thing, or until any
          event happens, other than an advance under any statutory or
          express power, whereby if the said income were payable
          during the trust period to the principal beneficiary
          absolutely during that period, the principal beneficiary
          would be deprived of the right to receive the same or any
          part thereof, in any of which cases, as well as on the
          termination of the trust period, whichever first happens,
          this trust of the said income shall fail or determine;
          (b) if the trust to which paragraph (a) refers fails or
          determines during the subsistence of the trust period,
          then, during the residue of that period, upon trust for the
          application thereof for the maintenance, education
          (including past maintenance or education), advancement or
          benefit, of all of any 1 or more exclusively of the other
          or others of the following persons (that is to say)â
               (i) the principal beneficiary and his or her wife
               or husband (if any), and his or her issue (if
               any);
               (ii) if there is no wife or husband or issue of
               the principal beneficiary in existence, the
               principal beneficiary and the persons who would,
               if the principal beneficiary were actually dead,
               be entitled to the trust property or the income
               thereof or to the annuity fund (if any), or
               arrears of the annuity, as the case may beâ
          as the trustee in the trusteeâs absolute discretion,
          without being liable to account for the exercise of such
          discretion, thinks fit.
     (2) Nothing in this section operates to validate any trust which
     would, if contained in the instrument creating the trust, be liable
     to be set aside.

     into the hands of the persons amongst whom the same may have been
     respectively distributed, and shall apply notwithstanding anything to
     the contrary in the will or other instrument (if any) creating the
     trust.

          (b) otherwiseâa newspaper circulating throughout the
          State and sold at least once each week;

     claim, whether as creditor or beneficiary or otherwise, to send
     particulars of the personâs claim not later than the date fixed in
     the notice, being a date at least 6 weeks after the date of
     publication of the notice.
     (2) Notice of advertisement is sufficient if given in the approved
     form.
     (3) After the date fixed by the last of the notices to be published
     the trustee or personal representative may distribute the trust
     property or estate having regard only to the claims, whether formal

     by any Act) which has been made, or which the trustee has reason to
     believe may be madeâ
          (a) to or against the estate or property which the trustee
          is administering; or
          (b) against the trustee personally, by reason of the
          trustee being under any liability in respect of which the
          trustee is entitled to reimburse himself or herself out of
          the estate or property which the trustee is administering;
     the trustee may serve upon the claimant or the person who may become
     a claimant a notice calling upon the claimant, within a period of 6
     months from the date of service of the notice, to take legal
     proceedings to enforce the claim and also to prosecute the
     proceedings with all due diligence.

     (2), the person concerned does not satisfy the court that the person
     has commenced proceedings and is prosecuting them with all due
     diligence, the court may make an orderâ
          (a) extending the period, or barring the claim, or enabling
          the trust property to be dealt with without regard to the
          claim; and

     respect of claims on 2 or more persons, and the period specified in
     each of those notices has expired, the trustee may, if the trustee
     thinks fit, apply for an order in respect of the claims of those
     persons by a single application, and the court may, on that
     application, make an order accordingly.
     (5) This section applies to every claim therein mentioned, whether

     section shall affect any application for revocation of any grant of
     probate or of letters of administration, whether that application is
     made before or after the order.

     is not made a party to an application by a trustee under this section

          (b) in such other manner as may be directed by an order of
          the court.

     have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.

     power of attorney and on a statutory declaration or other sufficient
     evidence that the power of attorney had not been revoked shall not be
     liable for that act or payment by reason of the fact that at the time
     of the act or payment the person who gave the power of attorney was
     subject to any disability or bankrupt or dead, or had done or
     suffered some act or thing to avoid the power, if this fact was not
     known to the trustee at the time of the trusteeâs so acting or
     paying.
     (2) Nothing in this section affects the right of any person entitled
     to money paid by a trustee, in circumstances mentioned in subsection
     (1), against the person to whom the payment is made; and the person
     so entitled shall have the same remedy against the person to whom
     payment is made as the person would have had against the trustee.
Implied indemnity of trustees
*** 71 Implied indemnity of trustees ***
A trustee shall be chargeable only for money and securities actually received
by the trustee, notwithstanding the trustee signing any receipt for the sake of
conformity; and shall be answerable and accountable only for the trusteeâs
own acts, receipts, neglects or defaults, and not for those of any other
trustee, nor those of any financial institution, broker or other person with

     powers conferred by section 62 and, for the purposes of section 62
     (1), the value of the chattels delivered pursuant to this section

assets of the estate of that deceased person as soon as the personal
representative has procured the registration of some other person as the holder
of the shares without reserving any portion of the estate for the payment of
any calls made after the date of that registration, whether made by the company
or its directors or by its liquidators in a winding-up, but nothing in this

follow the assets of the deceased person into the hands of any persons to or
amongst whom they have been transferred or distributed.
Power of court to relieve trustee from personal liability
*** 76 Power of court to relieve trustee from personal liability ***
If it appears to the court that a trustee, whether appointed by the court or
otherwise, is, or may be, personally liable for any breach of trust, whether
the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred before or after the
commencement of this Act, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought
fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the
directions of the court in the matter in which the trustee committed the
breach, then the court may relieve the trustee either wholly or partly from

     in a residuary gift is settled by way of succession, no part of the
     income of that property shall be applicable in or towards the payment
     of the debts and liabilities which have accrued at the date of death
     or in payment of the funeral, testamentary and administration
     expenses, or of any legacies bequeathed by the will.
     (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to any commission which is payable
     to the trustee in respect of any such income as is mentioned in that
     subsection or to any testamentary or administration expenses which,
     apart from that subsection, would be payable wholly out of income.
     (3) The income of the settled property shall be applicable in
     priority to any other assets in payment of the interest (if any)
     accruing due on the debts, liabilities, funeral, testamentary and
     administration expenses, and legacies, after the date of the death of
     the deceased and up to the payment thereof, and the balance of the
     income shall be payable to the person for the time being entitled to
     the income of the property.
     (4) Where, after the death of the deceased, income of assets which
     are ultimately applied in or towards payment of the debts,
     liabilities, funeral, testamentary and administration expenses, and
     legacies, arises pending such application, that income shall, for the
     purposes of this section, be deemed income of the residuary estate of
     the deceased.
     (5) In this sectionâ
     "administration expenses" includes duty payable under the Succession
     and Probate Duties Act 1892 and estate duty payable under any

     the will as between themselves, and shall not affect the rights of
     creditors of the deceased.

     to the contrary contained in the will and to the provisions of any
     Act as to charges on the property of the deceased.

     (1) The court may, whenever it is expedient to appoint a new trustee
     or new trustees, and it is found inexpedient, difficult or
     impracticable to do so without the assistance of the court, make an
     order appointing a new trustee or new trustees either in substitution
     for or in addition to any existing trustee or trustees, or although
     there is no existing trustee.
     (2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of

     corporation that is under official management or is in liquidation or
     has been dissolved, or who for any other reason whatsoever appears to
     the court to be undesirable as a trustee.
     (3) An order under this section and any consequential vesting order
     or conveyance, shall not operate further or otherwise as a discharge
     to any former or continuing trustee than an appointment of new
     trustees under any power for that purpose contained in any instrument
     would have operated.
     (4) Nothing in this section confers power to appoint an executor or
     administrator.
Powers of new trustee

any) creating the trust.

     it is inexpedient or difficult or impracticable to effect the
