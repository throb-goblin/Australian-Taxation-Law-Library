     (1) The regulations may contain provisions of a savings or
     transitional nature consequent on the enactment of the following
     Acts--
          this Act
          Wagering Legislation Amendment Act 2010
          any Act that amends this Act
     (2) Any such provision may, if the regulations so provide, take
     effect from the date of assent to the Act concerned or a later date.
     (3) To the extent to which any such provision takes effect from a
     date that is earlier than the date of its publication in the Gazette,
     the provision does not operate so as--
          (a) to affect, in a manner prejudicial to any person (other
          than the State or an authority of the State), the rights of
          that person existing before the date of its publication, or
          (b) to impose liabilities on any person (other than the
          State or an authority of the State) in respect of anything
          done or omitted to be done before the date of its
          publication.
     (4) Without limiting subclauses (1) and (2), regulations made for the
