      "text": "(1) For the purposes of this Act, a trust is a \"special trust\" if-- (a) the trust property includes land, and (b) the trustee of the trust is the owner of the legal estate in the land, and (c) the trust is not a fixed trust. (2) For the purposes of this section, a trust is a \"fixed trust\" if the equitable estate in all of the land that is the subject of the trust is owned by a person or persons who are owners of the land for land tax purposes (disregarding section 25 (3)). (3) For the purpose of determining whether a trust is a fixed trust under this section, any equitable interest of the trustee as trustee of the trust is to be disregarded. (3A) If a trust satisfies the relevant criteria, the persons who are beneficiaries of the trust under the trust deed are taken to be owners of an equitable estate in the land that is the subject of the trust and, accordingly, the trust is taken to be a fixed trust. Note : Under section 25, owners of an equitable estate or interest in land are liable in respect of land tax as if they were legal owners of the land. Owners of an equitable estate in land are treated as secondary taxpayers. (3B) For the purposes of this section, the \"relevant criteria\" are as follows-- (a) the trust deed specifically provides that the beneficiaries of the trust-- (i) are presently entitled to the income of the trust, subject only to payment of proper expenses by and of the trustee relating to the administration of the trust, and (ii) are presently entitled to the capital of the trust, and may require the trustee to wind up the trust and distribute the trust property or the net proceeds of the trust property, (b) the entitlements referred to in paragraph (a) cannot be removed, restricted or otherwise affected by the exercise of any discretion, or by a failure to exercise any discretion, conferred on a person by the trust deed, (c) if the trust is a unit trust-- (i) there must be only one class of units issued, and (ii) the proportion of trust capital to which a unit holder is entitled on a winding up or surrender of units must be fixed and must be the same as the proportion of income of the trust to which the unit holder is entitled. (4) A trust is not a \"special trust\" -- (a) if the trust is solely a charitable trust, or (b) if clause 9 of Schedule 1A applies in respect of the land that is the subject of the trust, or (c) if the trust is a concessional trust, or (d) in relation to any land tax year in which it is a superannuation trust, or (e) if the trust is established by will, but only during the period ending on the expiration of 2 years after the date of death of the testator, or (f) in relation to any land tax year in which it is a family unit trust, as provided by Schedule 1AA. (5) For the purposes of this section, a trust is a \"superannuation trust\" in relation to a land tax year if-- (a) the trust was established on or before 30 June in the year before that land tax year and, in relation to the year of income ending in that year, the trust is-- (i) a complying superannuation fund (within the meaning of section 42 or 42A of the Commonwealth Act), or (ii) a complying approved deposit fund (within the meaning of section 43 of the Commonwealth Act), or (iii) a pooled superannuation trust (within the meaning of section 44 of the Commonwealth Act), or (b) the trust was established after 30 June in the year before that land tax year and, as at midnight on 31 December in that year, the trust is-- (i) a regulated superannuation fund (within the meaning of the Commonwealth Act) or is taken to be a regulated superannuation fund under that Act, or (ii) an approved deposit fund (within the meaning of the Commonwealth Act), or (iii) a pooled superannuation trust (within the meaning of the Commonwealth Act). (6) Despite anything to the contrary in this section, a trust is taken to be a special trust in relation to a land tax year if the trust is classified as a special trust in respect of that land tax year under section 25A, and the classification has effect in respect of that land tax year. (7) In this section-- \"Commonwealth Act\""

(2) If a land value adjustment is required in relation to a parcel in the current land tax year, the average value is to be determined before that land value adjustment is made (that is, on the basis of the land value without that land value adjustment) and, despite any other provision of this Act, the Valuation of Land Act 1916 or the Heritage Act 1977, the land value adjustment is to be applied, for the purpose of assessing land tax, to the average value of the land for that land tax year (and not the land value). (3) For the purposes of this section, a \"land value adjustment\" is-- (a) a \"land value reduction\", being any reduction that is required to be made to the land value of land under this Act for the purpose of assessing land tax, or (c) a \"special allowance\", being any allowance made in respect of the land value of land under Division 3 or 4 of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916. (4) In the case of a land value reduction, the land value adjustment is to be applied to the average value of land by applying any provision of this Act that specifies that the land value is to be reduced for the purpose of assessing land tax as if a reference to the land value of land were a reference to the average value of land. Note : For example, the reductions provided for by sections 9A, 9BA, 9C, 9D, 9E, 10 (2), (2A) and (2C), 10Q (4) and 10R (3) will now apply to the average value of the land in a land tax year and not to the land value of the land. (6) In the case of a special allowance, the land value adjustment is to be applied to the average value of the land by deducting the allowance from the average value. (7) If a parcel of land did not exist on 31 December immediately before either or both of the preceding land tax years, the average value of the land is taken to be-- (a) if the parcel did exist on 31 December immediately before one of the preceding land tax years--the average of the land value of the land in relation to the current land tax year and the land value of the land in relation to the preceding land tax year immediately before which it did exist, or (b) in any other case--the land value of the land in relation to the current land tax year. (8) Subsection (2) applies in relation to an average value determined as provided for by subsection (7) in the same way as it applies to an average value determined as provided for by subsection (1). Note : For example, if the newly created parcel qualifies for an allowance for subdivision under Division 4 of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 in the current land tax year, the allowance would be applied to the average value calculated as provided for by subsection (7). (9) The average value of a parcel of land that is heritage-protected, and that was not heritage-protected on 31 December immediately before either or both of the preceding land tax years, is to be determined as provided for by subsection (7) (as if the parcel did not exist on the date or dates of 31 December on which it was not heritage- protected). (10) If the land value of land in relation to a land tax year is altered (whether as a result of being reascertained or on objection or appeal or for the correction of a clerical error or misdescription), the average value of the land must be reascertained on the basis of the altered land value. (11) If the average value of a parcel of land, after applying a land value adjustment, is less than zero, the average value of the parcel is taken to be zero. (12) For the purposes of this section, land is \"heritage-protected\" if it is either heritage restricted (within the meaning of section 14G of the Valuation of Land Act 1916) or the subject of a heritage valuation under Division 6 of Part 6 of the Heritage"

(2) The allowable proportion for a flat is as determined in accordance with whichever of the following paragraphs is applicable in the particular case-- (a) if there is an apportionment factor entered in the Register in respect of that land value--the proportion determined in accordance with the following calculation-- (b) if paragraph (a) is not applicable--the proportion specified in an application for a reduction under this section as the fair and reasonable proportion of the land value of the land to be attributed to the flat, subject to subsections (2A) and (2AA). (2A) If there is no apportionment factor entered in the Register in respect of the land value of the land, the Chief Commissioner may request the Valuer-General to determine the apportionment factor in respect of the land concerned. (2AA) If a request is made under subsection (2A)-- (a) the Valuer-General must determine the apportionment factor concerned and enter it in the Register, and (b) the allowable proportion for the flat must be determined in accordance with subsection (2) (a). (2AB) Apportionment factors for the purposes of this section are to be ascertained in accordance with Division 5 or Division 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916, as appropriate to the land concerned. If such an apportionment factor is expressed as a percentage, the apportionment factor is, for the purposes of this section, to be converted to a fraction. Note : Divisions 5 and 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 allow objections to be made against the amount of an apportionment factor. (3) The reduction under this section applies only if the following requirements are satisfied-- (a) the flat must be used and occupied by the owner of the land (or one of the owners) as his or her principal place of residence and for no other purpose, in which connection the use of the land for the purpose of one, but not more than one, residential occupancy other than that of the owner under lease or licence from the owner may be disregarded if it is an excluded residential occupancy (within the meaning of clause 4 of Schedule 1A), (c) an owner of the land who occupies the flat must not be an owner merely because of being a trustee, (d) the land must not be owned, or jointly owned, by a person in the person's capacity as trustee of a special trust, (e) the owner of the land must not be a company or company jointly with another person or other persons, except in either case a trustee company acting in its representative capacity. (4) For the purposes of determining whether a flat has been used and occupied by an owner of land as his or her principal place of residence under subsection (3) (a), clauses 8, 9 and 10 of Schedule 1A apply in respect of the flat, and that part of the land on which the flat is situated, in the same way as they apply in respect of land under the principal place of residence exemption. Note : The effect of this provision is to deem a flat to be used and occupied by the owner of the land as a principal place of residence in certain circumstances, similar to the principal place of residence exemption. As a consequence, the land value of the mixed development land or mixed use land on which the flat is situated can be reduced by the allowable proportion under this section. (5) Unless the land concerned is land to which subsection (2) (a) applies, there is to be no reduction under this section unless-- (a) application has been made for the reduction by all the owners of the land, specifying the proportion that in their opinion is a fair and reasonable proportion of the land value of the land to be attributed to the flat, and (b) the application is made in a form approved by the Chief Commissioner. (6) There is to be no reduction under this section if the building on the land, or the buildings on the land together, comprise 2 flats and the land is exempted from taxation under this Act.

      "text": "(1) For the purpose of assessing land tax, the land value of mixed use land on which is situated one single dwelling is to be reduced by the allowable proportion in relation to the dwelling. (2) The allowable proportion for the dwelling is to be determined in accordance with whichever of the following paragraphs is applicable in the particular case-- (a) if there is an apportionment factor entered in the Register in respect of that land value--the proportion determined by deducting that apportionment factor from 1, (b) if paragraph (a) is not applicable--the proportion specified in an application for a reduction under this section as the fair and reasonable proportion of the land value of the land to be attributed to the dwelling, subject to subsections (3) and (4). (3) If there is no apportionment factor entered in the Register in respect of the land value of the land, the Chief Commissioner may request the Valuer-General to determine the apportionment factor in respect of the land concerned. (4) If a request is made under subsection (3)-- (a) the Valuer-General must determine the apportionment factor concerned and enter it in the Register, and (b) the allowable proportion for the dwelling must be determined in accordance with subsection (2) (a). (5) Apportionment factors for the purposes of this section are to be ascertained in accordance with Division 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916. If such an apportionment factor is expressed as a percentage, the apportionment factor is, for the purposes of this section, to be converted to a fraction. Note : Division 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 allows objections to be made against the amount of an apportionment factor. (6) The reduction under this section applies only if the following requirements are satisfied-- (a) the single dwelling must be used and occupied by the owner of the land (or one of the owners) as his or her principal place of residence and for no other purpose, in which connection the use of the land for the purpose of one, but not more than one, residential occupancy other than that of the owner under lease or licence from the owner may be disregarded if it is an excluded residential occupancy (within the meaning of clause 4 of Schedule 1A), (b) an owner of the land who occupies the dwelling must not be an owner merely because of being a trustee, (c) the owner of the land must not be a company or company jointly with another person or other persons, except in either case a trustee company acting in its representative capacity. (6A) For the purposes of determining whether a single dwelling has been used and occupied by an owner of land as his or her principal place of residence under subsection (6) (a), clauses 8, 9 and 10 of Schedule 1A apply in respect of the single dwelling, and that part of the land on which the dwelling is situated, in the same way as they apply in respect of land under the principal place of residence exemption. Note : The effect of this provision is to deem a single dwelling to be used and occupied by the owner of the land as a principal place of residence in certain circumstances, similar to the principal place of residence exemption. As a consequence, the land value of the mixed use land on which the single dwelling is situated can be reduced by the allowable proportion under this section. (7) Unless the land concerned is land to which subsection (2) (a) applies, there is to be no reduction under this section unless-- (a) application has been made for the reduction by all the owners of the land, specifying the proportion that in their opinion is a fair and reasonable proportion of the land value of the land to be attributed to the dwelling, and (b) the application is made in a form approved by the Chief Commissioner. (8) For avoidance of doubt, if a reduction in the land value of land is required under this section and the land is jointly owned, then, for the purposes of section 27 (3) (a), the individual interest of each of the owners of the land (including the owner who occupies the dwelling) is to be assessed on the basis of the land value of the land as reduced under this section.

Note : Under section 3AL of the Land Tax Act 1956, land tax is charged, levied, collected and paid for the period of 12 months commencing on 1 January in the next succeeding year for land owned at midnight on 31 December in any year. So this reduction provision applies until the end of the 2040 land tax year. (2) For the purpose of assessing land tax, the land value of a parcel of land is to be reduced by 50% if-- (a) a building is situated on the land, and (b) construction of the building commenced on or after 1 July 2020, and (c) the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that a significant proportion of the labour force hours spent on the construction of the building involves or involved work performed by persons whom the Chief Commissioner considers belong to any one or more of the following classes of worker-- (i) apprentices or trainees, (ii) long-term unemployed workers, (iii) workers requiring upskilling, (iv) workers with barriers to employment (such as persons with disability), (v) Aboriginal jobseekers, (vi) graduates, and (d) the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the building is being used and occupied for a build-to-rent property in accordance with guidelines approved by the Treasurer for the purposes of this section, and (e) an application for the reduction is made in accordance with this section. (3) The guidelines may include provisions with respect to the following-- (a) the circumstances in which a building is taken to be a build-to-rent property, including in relation to the following-- (i) the planning or development standards that must be complied with, (ii) the minimum lease conditions that must be offered to tenants of the build-to-rent property, (iii) the minimum scale of a building to qualify as a build-to-rent property, (iv) the nature of the ownership and management of the building and the land on which the building is situated, (b) the circumstances in which the applicant is required to give an undertaking to not subdivide the land or otherwise divide the ownership of the land, (c) other matters relating to build-to-rent properties and the land on which build-to-rent properties are situated as the Treasurer determines appropriate. (4) The guidelines must include policies to promote the development of new affordable housing and social housing in build-to-rent properties. (5) Without limiting the other ways in which this section may cease to apply to a person, it ceases to apply to a person if the person breaches an undertaking given as referred to in subsection (3)(b). (6) A guideline may-- (a) apply generally or be limited in its application by reference to specified exceptions or factors, or (b) apply differently according to different factors of a specified kind, or both. (7) If the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that only part of a parcel of land is being used and occupied for a build-to-rent property, the reduction in land value under subsection (2) is to be proportionately decreased in accordance with guidelines approved by the Treasurer for the purposes of this section. (8) This section does not apply to an owner of land in respect of a tax year unless-- (a) the owner applies to the Chief Commissioner for the reduction, in the form approved by the Chief Commissioner, and (b) the owner furnishes the Chief Commissioner with the evidence that the Chief Commissioner requests for the purpose of enabling the Chief Commissioner to determine whether there is an entitlement to the reduction.

In such a case, the owner is taken, for the purpose of the principal place of residence exemption, to use and occupy the unoccupied land as the owner's principal place of residence. Note : It is an offence under section 55 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 to make a statement to a tax officer, or give information to a tax officer, orally or in writing, knowing that it is false or misleading in a material particular. (2) This clause does not apply unless-- (a) the land is unoccupied because the owner intends to carry out, or is carrying out, building or other works necessary to facilitate the owner's intended use and occupation of the land as a principal place of residence, and (b) if those building or other works have physically commenced on the land, no income has been derived from the use and occupation of the land since that commencement, and (c) the intended use and occupation of the land is not unlawful. (3) This clause applies in respect of the assessment of a person's ownership of land only in the period of-- (a) 4 tax years immediately following the year in which the person became owner of the land, or (b) if, after the person became owner and before the building or other works physically commence, the land is used and occupied for residential purposes by another person--4 tax years immediately following the tax year in which the other person ceases to use and occupy the land for those purposes. (4) Without limiting subclause (3) (a)-- (a) this clause does not apply in respect of the assessment of a person's ownership of land in a period referred to in subclause (3) (b) unless the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that, by the end of the first of the 4 tax years concerned-- (i) the building or other works will be, or have been, physically commenced, or (ii) significant steps will be, or have been, taken to enable those works to physically commence, and (b) if the building or other works are not physically commenced by the end of that tax year (or the Chief Commissioner is not satisfied that, by the end of that tax year, significant steps have been taken to enable those works to physically commence)-- (i) the principal place of residence exemption applying by operation of this clause to the land is taken not to have applied to the land in respect of that tax year (unless subclause (3) (a) applied to the assessment in that tax year), and (ii) land tax liability is to be assessed or reassessed accordingly.

(6) The effect of the revocation is that the principal place of residence exemption is taken not to have applied to the land in respect of any tax year to which, but for the revocation, it would have applied.
