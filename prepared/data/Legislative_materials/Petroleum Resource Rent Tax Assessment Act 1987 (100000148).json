(1A) Despite subsection (1), the Minister cannot specify, under that subsection, a production licence relating to the North West Shelf project. (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a): (a) a reference to operations, facilities and other things that have comprised a petroleum project includes, in the case of a combined project, a reference to operations, facilities and other things that have comprised the pre -combination projects in relation to the project; and (b) a reference to operations, facilities and other things that will comprise a petroleum project is a reference to operations, facilities and other things that are proposed, by the registered holders of, and the holders of registered interests in, the production licence or licences in relation to the project, to comprise the project. (4) The Minister may only issue a certificate under subsection (1) in respect of petroleum projects if: (a) a person who is entitled to receive at least half of the receipts from the sale of petroleum or marketable petroleum commodities produced in relation to each of the projects applies, in writing, to the Minister for the certificate to be issued; or (b) 2 or more persons who together are entitled to receive at least half of those receipts apply, in writing, to the Minister for the certificate to be issued. (4A) An application under subsection (4) may only be made within: (a) the period of 90 days beginning on the day the most recent production licence in relation to any of the petroleum projects came into force; or (b) if the Minister allows a longer period--that longer period. (4B) If the Minister does not make a decision on an application under subsection (4) before the later of the following times: (a) the end of the period of 90 days after the application is made; (b) if the Minister extends that period under subsection (4C)--the end of the extended period; the Minister is taken, for the purposes of subsection (12), to have refused the application at that time. (4C) The Minister may, by written notice to the applicant or applicants, extend the period mentioned in subsection (4B) if the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to do so to adequately consider the application. (5) A certificate under subsection (1) shall not be repealed, rescinded, revoked, amended or varied otherwise than: (a) under subsection (8); (b) pursuant to a decision of the Tribunal or an order of a court; or (c) to correct an error in the certificate. (6) A certificate under subsection (1) shall come into force on the issue of the certificate and continue in force until the issue of a subsequent certificate under that subsection specifying production licences that include such of the production licences specified in the first -mentioned certificate as are in force at the time when the subsequent certificate is issued. (7) Where, in deciding whether or not to issue a certificate under subsection (1) specifying 2 or more production licences, the Resources Minister has reasonable grounds to believe that an operation, facility or other thing is being, has been or is proposed to be carried on or provided, or is being, has been or is proposed to be carried on or provided in a particular manner or by particular persons, for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining the issue of the certificate, the Minister must disregard the carrying on or provision of the operation, facility or thing.

(1B) For the purposes of subsection (1), the previous period liability is an amount equal to the sum of the notional tax amounts (if any) worked out under subsection (1) in relation to the person, the petroleum project and any earlier instalment periods in the year of tax. (1BA) However, if a person was taken under subsection 22(3) or (4) to have a taxable profit in relation to the project and the financial year immediately preceding the year of tax, then: (a) subsection (1) of this section does not apply to the person in relation to the project and the year of tax; and (b) subject to subsection (2) of this section, the notional tax amount of the person, in relation to the project and an instalment period in the year of tax, is the tax that would, if the instalment period were a year of tax, be payable on the amount worked out in accordance with the formula: where: current period receipts means: (a) if the project is not a Greater Sunrise project--the assessable receipts derived by the person in relation to the project in the instalment period; or (b) if the project is a Greater Sunrise project--the assessable receipts derived by the person in relation to the project in the instalment period multiplied by the apportionment percentage figure for the instalment period. previous period receipts means: (a) if the instalment period is the first instalment period in the year of tax--nil; or (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--the current period receipts for the instalment period that ended most recently before the end of the instalment period. (1BB) For the purposes of subsection (1BA), if the whole or a part of the assessable petroleum receipts that would be taken into account in working out the current period receipts were determined under paragraph 24(1)(d) or (e) (the special calculation provisions), then, in calculating the current period receipts: (a) any assessable petroleum receipts determined under the special calculation provisions are to be excluded; and (b) the amount worked out in accordance with the regulations in respect of those assessable petroleum receipts is to be included.

Note 1: This section may apply separately to a person in relation to 2 or more instalment transfers in the same year of tax, even if the same instalment transfer amount is transferred between the same projects or companies by each instalment transfer (as allowed under subsection 45E(6)). Note 2: If a transfer is made by the Commissioner under section 45C because of a failure of a person to make a transfer as required by section 45A or 45B, the transfer is taken to be a transfer by the person under section 45A or 45B (as the case requires): see subsection 45C(4). Instalment transfer excess--offsets (2) The amount of the instalment transfer excess (as it would be apart from this subsection), in relation to a petroleum project, is reduced by: (a) an amount equal to so much of the excess as must be applied or transferred to reduce or eliminate any person&#39;s taxable profit in relation to any petroleum project and the year of tax; and (b) any amount of expenditure that must be transferred, by annual transfer in relation to the year of tax, to the project, or to the liable person in relation to the project, because the excess cannot be transferred as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b). (3) This section does not apply if the instalment transfer excess is reduced to zero (or a negative amount) by the operation of subsection (2). Liability to pay charge (4) The liable person is liable to pay a charge (the instalment transfer interest charge) on the instalment transfer excess for each day in the following period (the instalment transfer charge period) in the year of tax: (a) if the instalment period to which the excess relates is the first instalment period in the year--the period: (i) starting at the start of the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable for the first instalment period in the year; and (ii) ending immediately before the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable in relation to the second instalment period in the year; (b) if the instalment period to which the excess relates is the second instalment period in the year--the period: (i) starting at the start of the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable for the second instalment period in the year; and (ii) ending immediately before the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable in relation to the third instalment period in the year; (c) if the instalment period to which the excess relates is the third instalment period in the year--the period: (i) starting at the start of the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable for the third instalment period in the year; and (ii) ending immediately before the day on which tax is due and payable in relation to the year of tax. Note 1: For when instalments of tax are payable, see section 95. For when tax is payable in relation to the year of tax, see section 82. Note 2: For the amount of the charge, see section 98B.
