"Department" means:
 (a) a Department of State;
 (b) a Department of the Parliament established under the Parliamentary Service Act 1999; or

"Entitlements Act" means the Veteran&#39;s Entitlements Act 1986.
"Finance Department" means the Department that is administered by the Finance Minister.
"Finance Minister" has the meaning given by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
"responsible Department", in relation to the employment of a Commonwealth employee, means:

 (b) where the remuneration in respect of that employment is or was paid wholly or principally out of money appropriated under an Act other than an annual Appropriation Act:
 (i) if the employee performs or performed the duties of that employment in, or in respect of, a Department--that Department; or
