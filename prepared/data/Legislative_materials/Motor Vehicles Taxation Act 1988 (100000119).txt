          produce the vehicle within a specified period and at a
          specified place and provide all reasonable facilities to
          enable an authorised officer to examine it, or

          the registration or renewal of registration of a motor
          vehicle is made--
               (i) fails to comply with a requirement made in
               accordance with subsection (1) (b), or
               (ii) otherwise than by statutory declaration

               knows is false or misleading in respect of any
               matter necessary or convenient to enable the
               appropriate amount of tax or additional tax
               payable on a motor vehicle to be determined,
     that owner or person is guilty of an offence.
          : Maximum penalty--5 penalty units.
     (3) Transport for NSW shall determine whether any tax or additional

     such tax or additional tax, as the case may be, within a time
     stipulated by Transport for NSW.
     (3) If the person fails to comply with the requirement within the
     time so stipulated, the person is guilty of an offence.

          date of the alteration, variation or rescission, and

          temporary nature of any alteration referred to in
          subsection (1), determines should be applicable, and
          (b) shall be calculated at the rate of--
               (i) if the registration current at the date of

               before the alteration or, as the case may be,
               one-twelfth of the difference between the tax

               applicable after the alteration in respect of a
               yearly registration of the vehicle, or
