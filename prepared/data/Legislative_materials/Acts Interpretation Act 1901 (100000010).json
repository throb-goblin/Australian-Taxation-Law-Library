      "text": "The following is a simplified outline of this Act:\nOverviewThis Act is like a dictionary and manual to use when reading and interpreting Commonwealth Acts and instruments made under Commonwealth Acts.The definitions and many of the interpretation rules are aimed at making Commonwealth legislation shorter, less complex and more consistent in operation.A provision of this Act is subject to a contrary intention in other Commonwealth legislation.StructurePart 1 provides that this Act applies to all Acts. This Act also applies to legislative instruments, notifiable instruments and other instruments made under an Act (see subsection  13(1) of the Legislation Act 2003 and subsection  46(1) of this Act).Part 2 contains definitions that apply across all Commonwealth legislation (for example, Australian citizen, business day, document and month).Part 3 deals with the commencement of Commonwealth Acts. For example, section  4 allows certain powers to be exercised (like the making of appointments) between the enactment and commencement of an Act.Part 4 deals with the amendment, repeal and expiry of Commonwealth legislation. For example, section  7 provides that the repeal of an Act does not affect any rights accrued under the Act, or any legal proceedings instituted, before the repeal.Part 5 contains various rules for interpreting Commonwealth legislation, including: (a) section 15A (about interpreting an Act subject to the Constitution); and (b) section 15AA (which provides for interpreting an Act in a way that best achieves the purpose or object of the Act); and (c) section 15AB (about using material that is not part of an Act (like explanatory memorandums and second reading speeches) in interpreting an Act); and (d) sections 19 to 20 (which deal generally with references to Ministers and Departments in Acts, with the effect of machinery of government changes on references to Ministers and Departments and other authorities in Acts and Commonwealth agreements, and with the validity of acts done by Ministers).Part 6 deals with the service of documents on persons.Part 7 contains rules about exercising powers and performing functions and duties under Commonwealth legislation, including: (a) subsection 33(3) (which provides that a power to make an instrument includes the power to vary or revoke the instrument); and (b) section 33A (about acting appointments); and (c) sections 34AA, 34AB and 34A (about delegating powers, functions and duties).Part 8 deals with the calculation of distance, time and age.Part 9 deals with the citation of Acts.Part 10 deals with instruments other than legislative instruments or notifiable instruments. For example, it provides that this Act applies to those instruments and that expressions in those instruments have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation.Part 11 contains a regulation-making power."

Meaning of may (2A) Where an Act assented to after the commencement of this subsection provides that a person, court or body may do a particular act or thing, and the word &quot;may&quot; is used, the act or thing may be done at the discretion of the person, court or body. Powers, functions and duties of bodies not affected by membership vacancies (2B) Where an Act confers a power or function, or imposes a duty, on a body, whether incorporated or unincorporated, the exercise of the power or the performance of the function or duty is not affected merely because of a vacancy or vacancies in the membership of the body. Power to make instrument includes power to vary or revoke etc. instrument (3) Where an Act confers a power to make, grant or issue any instrument of a legislative or administrative character (including rules, regulations or by -laws) the power shall be construed as including a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like conditions (if any) to repeal, rescind, revoke, amend, or vary any such instrument. (3AA) If a condition (the ongoing condition): (a) must be satisfied before the making, granting or issuing of an instrument; and (b) is capable of ceasing to be satisfied after the making, granting or issuing of the instrument; subsection (3) has effect, in relation to the repeal, rescission or revocation of the instrument, as if the reference to like conditions (to the extent that the reference relates to the ongoing condition) were a reference to the ongoing condition ceasing to be satisfied. Example: A Minister may give a person a written permission if, among other things, the Minister is satisfied the person is of good character. This condition is capable of ceasing to be satisfied after the giving of the permission. The Minister may repeal, rescind or revoke the permission in the like manner if the Minister ceases to be satisfied that the person is of good character. Scope of powers in respect of matters (3A) Where an Act confers a power to make, grant or issue any instrument of a legislative or administrative character (including rules, regulations or by -laws) with respect to particular matters (however the matters are described), the power shall be construed as including a power to make, grant or issue such an instrument with respect to some only of those matters or with respect to a particular class or particular classes of those matters and to make different provision with respect to different matters or different classes of matters. (3AB) If an Act confers on a person or authority the power to make an instrument (except a legislative instrument, a notifiable instrument or a rule of court): (a) specifying, declaring or prescribing a matter; or (b) doing anything in relation to a matter; then, in exercising the power, the person or authority may identify the matter by reference to a class or classes of matters. Note: This provision has a parallel, in relation to legislative instruments, and notifiable instruments, in section 13 of the Legislation Act 2003. (3AC) For the purposes of subsections (3A) and (3AB), matter includes thing, person and animal. (3B) Where an Act confers a power to make, grant or issue any instrument of a legislative or administrative character (including rules, regulations or by -laws), the power shall not be taken, by implication, not to include the power to make provision for or in relation to a particular aspect of a matter by reason only that provision is made by the Act in relation to another aspect of that matter or in relation to another matter. Power to make appointment to an office or place (4) Where an Act confers upon any person or authority a power to make appointments to any office or place, the power shall be construed as including a power to appoint a person to act in the office or place until: (a) a person is appointed to the office or place; or (b) the expiration of 12 months after the office or place was created or became vacant, as the case requires; whichever first happens, and as also including a power to remove or suspend any person appointed, and to appoint another person temporarily in the place of any person so suspended or in place"
