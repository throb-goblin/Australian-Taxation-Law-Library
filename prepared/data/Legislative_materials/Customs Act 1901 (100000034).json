(5) The notice under subsection (1): (a) must state that, if the holder of the depot licence wishes to prevent the cancellation of the licence, he or she may, within 7 days after the day on which the notice is given, give to the Comptroller -General of Customs at an address specified in the notice a written statement showing cause why the licence should not be cancelled; and (b) may state that the licence is suspended if the notice is given because of the operation of paragraph (1)(ad) or (b). (6) If the notice under subsection (1) states that the depot licence is suspended, the licence is suspended on and from the giving of the notice. Note: For revocation of the suspension, see section 77VB. (7) Despite the giving of a notice under subsection (1) in relation to a depot licence, nothing in this Part prevents: (a) the Comptroller-General of Customs giving a notice under subsection 77T(1) in relation to the renewal of the licence; or (b) the holder of the licence obtaining a renewal of the licence by paying a depot licence charge in accordance with section 77T.

Note 1: To change the boundaries or other details of a place covered by a warehouse licence, the licence may be varied as mentioned in paragraph (b). Note 2: See subsection (9) for variation on the Comptroller-General&#39;s own initiative. (1A) An application under subsection (1) may be made by document or electronically. (2) A documentary application must: (a) be in writing; and (b) be in an approved form; and (c) contain such information as the form requires; and (d) be signed in the manner indicated in the form; and (e) except if the application is in relation to an excise -equivalent warehouse licence--be accompanied by the warehouse licence variation charge. (2AA) An electronic application must: (a) communicate such information as is set out in an approved statement; and (b) except if the application is in relation to an excise -equivalent warehouse licence--be accompanied by the warehouse licence variation charge. (2A) If: (a) a licence (the first licence) covers a particular place; and (b) the Comptroller-General of Customs varies another warehouse licence held by the same licence holder to cover the place; the Comptroller-General must, by written notice given to the licence holder: (c) unless paragraph (d) applies--vary the first licence to no longer cover the place; or (d) if the effect of varying the first licence as mentioned in paragraph (c) would be that no places are covered by the licence--cancel the first licence. (3) The Comptroller -General of Customs may, by written notice given to an applicant for the variation of a warehouse licence, require the applicant to give further information in relation to the application: (a) within the period that is specified in the notice; or (b) within such further period as the Comptroller -General of Customs allows. Note: See section 102AA for the ways in which the notice may be given to the applicant. (4) If an application for the variation of a warehouse licence is made under subsection (1), the Comptroller-General of Customs must not grant the application if, in the Comptroller-General&#39;s opinion: (a) the physical security of a place that would be covered by the licence as varied would not be adequate having regard to: (i) the nature of the place; or (ii) the kinds and quantity of goods that would be kept in the place if the variation were made; or (iii) the procedures and methods that would be adopted by the applicant to ensure the security of goods in the place if the variation were made; or (b) the plant and equipment that would be used in relation to goods in a place that would be covered by the licence as varied would not be suitable having regard to the nature of those goods and that place; or (c) the books of account or records that would be kept in relation to a place that would be covered by the licence as varied would not be suitable to enable an officer of Customs adequately to audit those books or records.

      "text": "Definitions (1) In this Division: \"Agreement\" means the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement done at Washington DC on 18 May 2004, as amended from time to time. Note: In 2004 the text of the Agreement was accessible through the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. \"Australian originating goods\" means goods that are Australian originating goods under a law of the US that implements the Agreement. \"Convention\" means the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System done at Brussels on 14 June 1983. Note: The text of the Convention is set out in Australian Treaty Series 1988 No. 30. In 2004 this was available in the Australian Treaties Library of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, accessible through that Department&#39;s website. \"customs value\", in relation to goods, has the meaning given by section 159. \"fuel\" has its ordinary meaning. \"Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System\" means the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System that is established by or under the Convention. \"Harmonized System\" means: (a) the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System as in force on 1 January 2007; or (b) if the table in Annex 4-A or 5-A of the Agreement is amended or replaced to refer to Chapters, headings and subheadings of a later version of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System--the later version of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. \"Harmonized US Tariff Schedule\" means the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (as in force from time to time). \"indirect materials\" means: (a) goods used in the production, testing or inspection of other goods, but that are not physically incorporated in the other goods; or (b) goods used in the operation or maintenance of buildings or equipment associated with the production of other goods; including: (c) fuel; and (d) tools, dies and moulds; and (e) lubricants, greases, compounding materials and other similar goods; and (f) gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies for any of these things; and (g) catalysts and solvents. \"Interpretation Rules\" means the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System provided for by the Convention. \"non-originating materials\" means goods that are not originating materials. \"originating materials\" means: (a) goods that are used in the production of other goods and that are US originating goods; or (b) goods that are used in the production of other goods and that are Australian originating goods; or (c) indirect materials. Example: This example illustrates goods produced from originating materials and non-originating materials. Pork sausages are produced in the US from US cereals, Hungarian frozen pork meat and Brazilian spices. The US cereals are originating materials since they are goods used in the production of other goods (the sausages) and they are US originating goods under Subdivision B. The Hungarian frozen pork meat and Brazilian spices are non-originating materials since they are produced in countries other than the US and Australia. \"person of the US\" means a person of a Party within the meaning, in so far as it relates to the US, of Article 1.2 of the Agreement. \"produce\" means grow, raise, mine, harvest, fish, trap, hunt, manufacture, process, assemble or disassemble. Producer and production have corresponding meanings. \"recovered goods\" means goods in the form of individual parts that: (a) have resulted from the complete disassembly of goods which have passed their useful life or which are no longer useable due to defects; and (b) have been cleaned, inspected or tested (as necessary) to bring them into reliable working condition. \"remanufactured goods\" means goods that: (a) are produced entirely in the US; and (b) are classified to: (i) Chapter 84, 85 or 87 (other than heading 8418, 8516 or 8701 to 8706), or to heading 9026, 9031 or 9032 of Chapter 90, of the Harmonized System; or (ii) any other tariff classification prescribed by the regulations; and (c) are entirely or partially comprised of recovered goods; and (d) have a similar useful life, and meet the same performance standards, as new goods: (i) that are so classified; and (ii) that are not comprised of any recovered goods; and (e) have a producer&#39;s warranty similar to such new goods. \"textile or apparel good\" has the meaning given by Article 1.2 of Chapter 1 of the Agreement. \"US\" means the United States of America. \"used\" means used or consumed in the production of goods. \"US originating goods\" means goods that, under this Division, are US originating goods. \"wholly formed\", in relation to elastomeric yarn, has the same meaning as it has in the Agreement.

(3) The following example illustrates the operation of paragraph (c) of the definition of reference sale in subsection (2): Facts: There were 2 contemporary sales of 5 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $100. There were 6 contemporary sales of 3 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $40. There was one contemporary sale of 4 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $40. There was one contemporary sale of 7 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $60. There were 3 contemporary sales of 2 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $60. This means that: Section 10 units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $100. Section 22 units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $40. Section 13 units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $60. Result: More units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $40 than were sold in such sales at any other unit price.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the seizure of goods under section 203B, 203C, 203CA or 203CB. (3) In considering whether the authorised person has demonstrated the necessity, in all the circumstances, for seizure of the goods, the judicial officer may have regard to, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors: (a) the seriousness or otherwise of any offence by reason of the commission of which the goods are believed to be forfeited goods; (b) the circumstances in which any such offence is believed to have been committed; (c) the pecuniary or other penalty that might be imposed for any such offence; (d) the nature, quality, quantity and estimated value of the goods; (e) whether an infringement notice might be given for any such offence; (f) the inconvenience or cost to any person having a legal or equitable interest in the goods if they were seized. (4) If: (a) the person applying for the warrant has, at any time previously, applied for a warrant relating to the search of, or seizure of goods that are on or in, the same premises; and (b) the premises are not a Customs place; the person must state particulars of those applications and their outcome in the information. (5) If a judicial officer issues a warrant, the judicial officer is to state in the warrant: (a) a description of the goods to which the warrant relates; and (b) a description of the premises on or in which the goods are believed to be located; and (c) the name of the authorised person who, unless that authorised person inserts the name of another authorised person in the warrant, is to be responsible for executing the warrant; and (d) the time at which the warrant expires (see subsection (5A)); and (e) whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours. (5A) The time stated in the warrant under paragraph (5)(d) as the time at which the warrant expires must be a time that is not later than the end of the seventh day after the day on which the warrant is issued. Example: If a warrant is issued at 3 pm on a Monday, the expiry time specified must not be later than midnight on Monday in the following week. (6) The judicial officer is also to state in the warrant: (a) that it authorises the seizure of goods (other than forfeited goods of the kind referred to in paragraph (5)(a)) found on or in the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be special forfeited goods; and (b) whether the warrant authorises an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person who is at or near the premises when the warrant is executed, if the executing officer or a person assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has any forfeited goods of the kind referred to in paragraph (5)(a), special forfeited goods or seizable items in his or her possession; and (c) whether the warrant authorises an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person who is at or near the premises when the warrant is executed, if the executing officer or a person assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has in his or her possession any relevant evidential material. (7) Paragraph (5)(d) and subsection (5A) do not prevent the issue of successive warrants in relation to the same premises. (8) If the application for the warrant is made under section 203M, this section (other than subsection (5A)) applies as if: (a) subsection (1) referred to 48 hours rather than 72 hours; and (b) paragraph (5)(d) required the judicial officer to state in the warrant the period for which the warrant is to remain in force, which must not be more than 48 hours. (9) A judicial officer of a particular State or Territory may issue a warrant in respect of the seizure of goods on or in premises in another State or Territory.

and\n (b) subject to subsection  (4A), the industry consists of that person or those persons.\n (4A) Where, in relation to goods of a particular kind first referred to in subsection  (4), the like goods referred to in that subsection are close processed agricultural goods, then, despite subsection (4), the industry in respect of those close processed agricultural goods consists not only of the person or persons producing the processed goods but also of the person or persons producing the raw agricultural goods from which the processed goods are derived.\n (4B) For the purposes of subsection  (4A), processed agricultural goods derived from raw agricultural goods are not to be taken to be close processed agricultural goods unless the Minister is satisfied that:\n (a) the raw agricultural goods are devoted substantially or completely to the processed agricultural goods; and\n (b) the processed agricultural goods are derived substantially or completely from the raw agricultural goods; and\n (c) either:\n (i) there is a close relationship between the price of the processed agricultural goods and the price of the raw agricultural goods; or\n (ii) a significant part of the production cost of the processed agricultural goods, whether or not there is a market in Australia for those goods, is, or would be, constituted by the cost to the producer of those goods of the raw agricultural goods.\n (4C) Where the Minister is satisfied that sufficient information has not been furnished or is not available to enable the production cost of processed agricultural goods to be ascertained for the purpose of subsection  (4B), the production cost of those goods is such amount as is determined by the Minister having regard to all relevant information.\n (4D) In this Act, a reference to variable factors relevant to the determination of duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act on particular goods the subject of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice is a reference:\n (a) if the goods are the subject of a dumping duty notice:\n (i) to the normal value of the goods; and\n (ii) to the export price of the goods; and\n (iii) to the non-injurious price of the goods; and\n (b) if the goods are the subject of a countervailing duty notice:\n (i) to the amount of countervailable subsidy received in respect of the goods; and\n (ii) to the export price of the goods; and\n (iii) to the non-injurious price of the goods.\n (4E) In this Act, a reference to variable factors relevant to the review under Division  5 of anti-dumping measures, or to the conduct of an anti-circumvention inquiry in relation to a notice published under subsection  269TG(2) or 269TJ(2), in respect of goods is a reference:\n (a) if the goods are the subject of a dumping duty notice--to the normal value, export price and non -injurious price of goods of that kind as ascertained, or last ascertained, by the Minister for the purpose of the notice; and\n (b) if the goods are the subject of a countervailing duty notice:\n (i) to the amount of countervailable subsidy received in respect of the goods; and\n (ia) to the export price of the goods; and\n (ii) to the non -injurious price of the goods;\n  as ascertained, or last ascertained, by the Minister for the purpose of the notice; and\n (c) if the goods are the subject of an undertaking accepted under section  269TG--to the normal value of the goods, and the non-injurious price of the goods, as indicated by the Minister to the exporter in negotiations relating to the acceptability of the undertaking; and\n (d) if the goods are the subject of an undertaking accepted under section  269TJ--to the countervailable subsidy received in respect of the goods, and the non-injurious price of the goods, as indicated by the Minister to the exporter or to the country of export in negotiations relating to the acceptability of the undertaking.\n (5) A reference in this Act to goods the subject of an application under section  269TB is a reference to goods referred in the application:\n (a) that have been imported into Australia;\n (b) that are likely to be so imported; or\n (c) that may be so imported, being like goods to goods to which paragraph  (a) or (b) applies.\n (5A) For the purposes of this Part, the weighted average of prices, values, costs or amounts in relation to goods over a particular period is to be worked out in accordance with the following formula:\nwhere:\n\"P\"1 , P2  ... Pn means the price, value, cost or amount, per unit, in respect of the goods in the respective transactions during the period.\n\"Q\"1 , Q2  ... Qn means the number of units of the goods involved in each of the respective transactions.\n (5B) In working out the number of units of goods involved in a transaction, any units of goods that are, for the purposes of paragraph  269TAB(1)(b) or (c), subsection 269TAB(3), paragraph 269TAC(2)(c) or (4)(e) or subsection  269TAC(6), treated as being involved in a particular transaction are taken to be actually involved in the transaction.\n (5C) A country has an economy in transition at a time if:\n (a) before the time, the Government of the country had a monopoly, or a substantial monopoly, of the trade of that country and determined, or substantially influenced, the domestic price of goods in that country; and\n (b) at the time, that Government does not:\n (i) have a monopoly, or a substantial monopoly, of the trade of that country; or\n (ii) determine, or substantially influence, the domestic price of goods in that country.\n (6) Sundays and public holidays shall, notwithstanding the definition of days in section 4 be counted as days for the purpose of computing a period for the purposes of this Part but nothing in this subsection shall derogate from the operation of section  36 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901."

(5J) For the purposes of fulfilling Australia&#39;s international obligations under an international agreement, regulations may be made to disapply subsection (5D) to a country.

(9) Where the normal value of goods exported to Australia is to be ascertained in accordance with paragraph (2)(c) or (4)(e), the Minister must make such adjustments, in determining the costs to be determined under that paragraph, as are necessary to ensure that the normal value so ascertained is properly comparable with the export price of those goods. (10) Where: (a) the actual country of export of goods exported to Australia is not the country of origin of the goods; and (b) the Minister is of the opinion that the normal value of the goods should be ascertained for the purposes of this Part as if the country of origin were the country of export; he or she may direct that the normal value of the goods is to be so ascertained. (11) For the purposes of subsection (10), the country of origin of goods is: (a) in the case of unmanufactured raw products--the country of which they are products; or (b) in any other case--the country in which the last significant process in the manufacture or production of the goods was performed. (14) If: (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and (b) goods the subject of the application are exported to Australia; but (c) the volume of sales of like goods for home consumption in the country of export by the exporter or another seller of like goods is less than 5% of the volume of goods the subject of the application that are exported to Australia by the exporter; the volume of sales referred to in paragraph (c) is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), to be a low volume unless the Minister is satisfied that it is still large enough to permit a proper comparison for the purposes of assessing a dumping margin under section 269TACB."

Note: The Commissioner may be required to reject the application or be able to terminate the examination of it without deciding what recommendation to make to the Minister. See section 269YA. (2) If the Commissioner considers that any person (including the applicant) may be able to supply information relevant to the consideration of the application, the Commissioner may, by notice in writing, request the supply of that information, in writing: (a) if the information is sought from a person other than the applicant--within a period specified in the notice ending not later than 120 days after the lodgment of the application; and (b) if the information is sought from the applicant--within a period specified in the notice ending not later than 155 days after the lodgment of the application. (3) Where the Commissioner proposes to take into account any relevant information that was not supplied to the Commissioner by the applicant, the Commissioner must: (a) give the applicant a copy of the information that he or she proposes to take into account unless, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the provision of that information would adversely affect the business or commercial interests of a person supplying the information; and (b) invite the applicant, within a specified period ending not later than 155 days after the lodgment of the application, to make any further submission the applicant considers appropriate in relation to that information. (3A) However, the Commissioner must not give the applicant information that the exporter of goods covered by the application supplied to the Commissioner (whether as a result of a request under subsection (2) or otherwise) that is relevant to working out: (a) the normal value of the goods; or (b) the countervailable subsidy relating to the goods; or (c) the export price of the goods; unless the exporter indicates that he or she is willing for the Commissioner to give the information to the applicant under paragraph (3)(a). (4) If a person refuses or fails to supply information or to make a submission within the period allowed but subsequently supplies that information or makes that submission, the Commissioner may disregard that information or submission in considering the application. (5) On the basis of the information and evidence contained in the application, any other information provided under subsection (2) or (3) that is not disregarded under subsection (4) and any other information the Commissioner considers relevant, the Commissioner must: (a) provisionally ascertain, in relation to each consignment of goods to which the application relates, each variable factor relevant to the determination of duty payable on the goods under the Dumping Duty Act; and (b) having regard to those variable factors as so provisionally ascertained and, where appropriate, to the non -injurious price of goods of that kind--provisionally calculate, in respect of each such consignment, the amount of duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act. (5A) Subsection (5B) of this section applies if the Commissioner proposes to ascertain provisionally, for the purposes of paragraph (5)(a) of this section, the export price of goods (under paragraph 269TAB(1)(b) or otherwise) as the difference between: (a) the price at which the importer of the goods sold them, in the condition in which they were imported, to someone who was not an associate of the importer; and (b) the prescribed deductions (as defined in subsection 269TAB(2)) relating to the goods. (5B) In provisionally ascertaining the export price of goods as described in subsection (5A), the Commissioner must: (a) take account of the following in relation to the goods: (i) any change in normal value; (ii) any change in costs incurred between importation and resale; (iii) any movement in resale price which is duly reflected in subsequent selling prices; and (b) despite paragraph 269TAB(1)(b), not deduct the amount of interim duty if the Commissioner has conclusive evidence of the things mentioned in subparagraphs (a)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this subsection. An expression used in this subsection and subparagraph 3.3 of Article 9 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 set out in Annex 1A to the World Trade Organization Agreement has the same meaning in this subsection as it has in that subparagraph."

If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.

The notes at the end of this compilation (the endnotes) include information about amending laws and the amendment history of provisions of the compiled law. Uncommenced amendments The effect of uncommenced amendments is not shown in the text of the compiled law. The details of amendments made up to, but not commenced at, the compilation date are underlined in the endnotes. Any uncommenced amendments affecting the law are accessible on the Register (www.legislation.gov.au). Application, saving and transitional provisions If the operation of a provision or amendment of the compiled law is affected by an application, saving or transitional provision that is not included in this compilation, details are included in the endnotes. Editorial changes For more information about any editorial changes made in this compilation, see the endnotes. Presentational changes The Legislation Act 2003 provides for First Parliamentary Counsel to make presentational changes to a compilation. Presentational changes are applied to give a more consistent look and feel to legislation published on the Register, and enable the user to more easily navigate those documents. Modifications If the compiled law is modified by another law, the compiled law operates as modified but the modification does not amend the text of the law. Accordingly, this compilation does not show the text of the compiled law as modified. Any modifications affecting the law are accessible on the Register. Self-repealing provisions If a provision of the compiled law has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law, details are included in the endnotes.

The information includes commencement details for amending laws and details of any application, saving or transitional provisions that are not included in this compilation. The amendment history in endnote 4 provides information about amendments at the provision (generally section or equivalent) level. It also includes information about any provision of the compiled law that has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law. Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.

The notes at the end of this compilation (the endnotes) include information about amending laws and the amendment history of provisions of the compiled law. Uncommenced amendments The effect of uncommenced amendments is not shown in the text of the compiled law. The details of amendments made up to, but not commenced at, the compilation date are underlined in the endnotes. Any uncommenced amendments affecting the law are accessible on the Register (www.legislation.gov.au). Application, saving and transitional provisions If the operation of a provision or amendment of the compiled law is affected by an application, saving or transitional provision that is not included in this compilation, details are included in the endnotes. Editorial changes For more information about any editorial changes made in this compilation, see the endnotes. Presentational changes The Legislation Act 2003 provides for First Parliamentary Counsel to make presentational changes to a compilation. Presentational changes are applied to give a more consistent look and feel to legislation published on the Register, and enable the user to more easily navigate those documents. Modifications If the compiled law is modified by another law, the compiled law operates as modified but the modification does not amend the text of the law. Accordingly, this compilation does not show the text of the compiled law as modified. Any modifications affecting the law are accessible on the Register. Self-repealing provisions If a provision of the compiled law has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law, details are included in the endnotes.

The amendment history in endnote 4 provides information about amendments at the provision (generally section or equivalent) level. It also includes information about any provision of the compiled law that has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law. Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.

The notes at the end of this compilation (the endnotes) include information about amending laws and the amendment history of provisions of the compiled law. Uncommenced amendments The effect of uncommenced amendments is not shown in the text of the compiled law. The details of amendments made up to, but not commenced at, the compilation date are underlined in the endnotes. Any uncommenced amendments affecting the law are accessible on the Register (www.legislation.gov.au). Application, saving and transitional provisions If the operation of a provision or amendment of the compiled law is affected by an application, saving or transitional provision that is not included in this compilation, details are included in the endnotes. Editorial changes For more information about any editorial changes made in this compilation, see the endnotes. Presentational changes The Legislation Act 2003 provides for First Parliamentary Counsel to make presentational changes to a compilation. Presentational changes are applied to give a more consistent look and feel to legislation published on the Register, and enable the user to more easily navigate those documents. Modifications If the compiled law is modified by another law, the compiled law operates as modified but the modification does not amend the text of the law. Accordingly, this compilation does not show the text of the compiled law as modified. Any modifications affecting the law are accessible on the Register. Self-repealing provisions If a provision of the compiled law has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law, details are included in the endnotes.

The amendment history in endnote 4 provides information about amendments at the provision (generally section or equivalent) level. It also includes information about any provision of the compiled law that has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law. Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.
