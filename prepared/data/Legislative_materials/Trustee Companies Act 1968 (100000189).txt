     conferred by subsections (1) and (3) where any property is held by a
     trustee company in trust for an infant, either for life or for any
     greater interest, whether absolutely or contingently upon the infant
     attaining a specified age, or on the occurrence of any event before

          (a) apply for the infantâs maintenance, education,
          advancement or otherwise for his or her benefit the income
          of that property or any part thereof, whether there is any
          fund available for the same purpose, or any person is bound

          education, or not; or
          (b) pay that income to any person to be applied for the

          (b) hold the accumulations for the benefit of the persons
          who ultimately become entitled to the property from which
          the same arise, but so that the trustee company may at any

          part thereof as if the same were income arising in the then
          current year.
     (7) Subsections (5) and (6) apply only if and so far as a contrary
     intention is not expressed in the instrument under which the interest
     of the infant arises, and shall have effect subject to the terms of
     that instrument and to the provisions therein contained.
     (8) In addition to and not by way of limitation of any of the powers
     conferred by subsections (1) to (7), with the consent of the persons
     having prior estates or interests in property, whether corpus or
     capital or income, held under an instrument, whether the income is
     directed to be accumulated or not, if such corpus, capital, or income
     is made payable to a class of persons, and the members of that class,
     or some of them, would ultimately, on attaining a specified age or on
     the happening of an event, be entitled to a share of such corpus,
     capital, or income and by survivorship or otherwise may become
     entitled to the shares of the other members of the class, the
     contingencies being equal, the Court may authorise the application
     of, or the trustee company may with the like consent apply, the
     presumptive or contingent shares of infants belonging to the class
     towards their maintenance, education, advancement, or benefit,
     notwithstanding that there may be future members of the class who may
     come into existence.
     (9) Where any member of the class referred to in subsection (8) has
     attained the required age or become entitled by age or otherwise,

     trustee company or by an infant, but nothing in this subsection shall
     be taken as limiting a trustee companyâs power to act under that
     subsection without an authorisation by the Court.
     (11) In construing and giving effect to the respective provisions of
     this section, the one shall be taken in aid of the other, and so that
     each of the provisions can be exercised independently the one of the
     other.

          in accordance with those provisions; and

          register or record in the appropriate way the transfer of
          an asset or liability under the certificate to the
          receiving company.
     (6) A transaction related to an asset or liability transferred to a
     receiving company entered into by the receiving company in the
     transferring companyâs name or the name of a predecessor in title
     to the transferring company, if effected by an instrument otherwise
     in registrable form, must be registered even though the receiving
     company has not been registered as proprietor of the asset or
     liability.
     (7) If an asset or liability is registered in the name of a receiving
     company, the registrar of titles or other registering authority may
     register a dealing for a transaction about the asset or liability
