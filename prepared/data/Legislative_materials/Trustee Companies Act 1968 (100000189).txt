     which as estimated by any trustee company does not at the time of the
     election hereinafter mentioned exceed $100000, and no person has
     taken out administration in Queensland, the trustee company, in any
     case where it would be entitled to obtain such a grant, may, in
     accordance with this section, instead of obtaining such a grant, file
     in the Court an election in writing, under the seal of the company,
     to administer the estate of the deceased person.
     (2) On any such election being filed, the trustee company shall be
     deemed to be the executor of the will or the administrator of the
     estate, as the case may be, in like manner and to the same extent in
     all respects as if administration had been duly granted to it.
     (3) Every such election shall set forth the name, residence, and
     occupation of the deceased so far as they are then known to the
     trustee company, and the date of the death of the deceased and the
     property situated in Queensland of the deceased as then known.
     (4) The election shall contain in every case where the deceased died
     intestate a statement to that effect, and in every case where the
     deceased died testate a statement that after due inquiries the
     trustee company believes that the document annexed to the election is
     the testatorâs last will (or an exemplification thereof where
     administration has been granted out of Queensland) and that the will
     has been validly executed according to the law governing the
     execution of wills.
     (5) No such election may be filed under this section unless there is
     endorsed thereon a certificate by a solicitor (whether in the
     employment of the trustee company or not) that (as the case may
     require) the solicitor is satisfied that the Court would, on
     application duly made, grant to the trustee companyâ
          (a) probate of the will to which the election relates; or
          (b) letters of administration with the will to which the

          person without a will annexed.

     the Court in which an application for a grant of administration of
     the will or estate of the deceased person may be filed.
     (7) If after filing any such election as aforesaid the gross value of
     the property situated in Queensland to be administered is found to
     exceed the sum of $120000, the trustee company shall as soon as
     practicable thereafter file in the registry of the Court in which the
     election to administer was filed a memorandum under the seal of the
     trustee company stating the fact, and shall thereupon proceed in the
     ordinary manner to obtain a grant of administration in Queensland,
     and for that purpose may uplift from the Court any will or
     exemplification filed with the election.

     (1) Where a grant of administration (
     "the original grant") has been made in Queensland in respect of the
     estate of any deceased person (the
     "original estate") and the persons to whom the original grant or any
     substituted grant of administration was made have died, whether
     before or after the commencement of this Act, leaving part of the
     original estate unadministered, and the gross value of the property
     situated in Queensland so left unadministered, as estimated by the
     trustee company at the time of the election hereinafter mentioned,
     does not exceed the sum of $100000, and no person has since the death
     of the last administrator taken out letters of administration de
     bonis non in Queensland in respect of the original estate, the
     trustee company may, in accordance with this section, instead of
     applying for letters of administration de bonis non in Queensland,
     file in the registry of the Court out of which the original grant was
     issued an election in writing under the seal of the company setting
     forth the fact of the original grant, the death of the executors or
     other administrators, and the particulars of the property situated in
     Queensland so left unadministered, and electing to administer the
     part of the original estate so left unadministered.
     (2) On the election being filed, the trustee company shall be deemed
     to be administrator of the original estate left unadministered in
     like manner and to the same extent in all respects as if letters of
     administration de bonis non had been duly granted to it.
     (3) No such election may be filed under this section unless there is
     endorsed thereon a certificate by a solicitor (whether in the
     employment of the trustee company or not) that the solicitor is
     satisfied that the Court would, on application duly made, grant to
     the trustee company letters of administration de bonis non in respect
     of the part of the original estate so left unadministered.
     (4) If after the filing of any such election the gross value of the
     property situated in Queensland to be administered by the trustee
     company is found to exceed the sum of $120000, the trustee company
     shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, file in the said registry
     of the Court a memorandum under the seal of the trustee company
     stating the fact, and shall thereupon proceed in the ordinary manner
     to obtain in Queensland letters of administration de bonis non
     (either with or without the will annexed, as the case may be) in
     respect of the said estate, and for that purpose may uplift from the
     Court any will or exemplification filed with the election.
     (5) Notice of an election under this section shall be advertised once
     in the gazette in a form approved by the person who for the time
     being holds the office of the registrar.
Notice of filing of election

     (1) If a trustee company files an election under section 12 or 13, it
     must give notice of the election to the commissioner of state revenue

     (2) The notice must be in the form approved by the commissioner.
Operation of election to administer as regards property out of State
*** 15 Operation of election to administer as regards property out of State ***
In determining the value of the property of any person that is situated in
Queensland for the purposes of sections 12 and 13, that property shall not
include or be deemed to include property situated out of Queensland at the time
of the filing of any election to administer, whether or not the property may
afterwards be transferred to Queensland (whether to the trustee company or to
any other person) in due course of administration, whether for the purposes of
distribution to the persons beneficially entitled thereto or otherwise
howsoever, but in all other respects every election referred to in sections 12
and 13 shall extend and apply to and include the property situated out of
Queensland in the same manner and to the same extent in all respects as a grant
of administration obtained by the trustee company would in the circumstances of
each particular case extend or apply to or include that property.
Revocation of elections filed in error
*** 16 Revocation of elections filed in error ***
     (1) Where any trustee company has, pursuant to any of the provisions
     of sections 12 and 13, filed an election to administer the estate of
     a deceased person, and the trustee company subsequently discovers
     that the election is invalid or ineffective by reason of the
     discovery of a will or a later will, or of the revocation or
     invalidity of a will, or for any other reason, then and in any such
     case the trustee company shall file in the registry of the Court in
     which the election to administer was filed a memorandum under the
     seal of the trustee company setting out the facts and certifying that
     the election already filed is invalid or ineffective.
     (2) Upon any such memorandum being filed, the election to administer
     previously filed shall cease to be of any effect whatsoever, and
     thereafter an application for administration may be made or a fresh
     election may be filed in all respects as if the election to
     administer previously filed had not been filed.

          application.

     conferred by subsections (1) and (3) where any property is held by a
     trustee company in trust for an infant, either for life or for any
     greater interest, whether absolutely or contingently upon the infant
     attaining a specified age, or on the occurrence of any event before
     attaining that age, the trustee company may in its discretionâ
          (a) apply for the infantâs maintenance, education,
          advancement or otherwise for his or her benefit the income
          of that property or any part thereof, whether there is any
          fund available for the same purpose, or any person is bound

          income thereof; and
          (b) hold the accumulations for the benefit of the persons
          who ultimately become entitled to the property from which
          the same arise, but so that the trustee company may at any
          time at its discretion apply those accumulations or any
          part thereof as if the same were income arising in the then
          current year.
     (7) Subsections (5) and (6) apply only if and so far as a contrary
     intention is not expressed in the instrument under which the interest
     of the infant arises, and shall have effect subject to the terms of
     that instrument and to the provisions therein contained.
     (8) In addition to and not by way of limitation of any of the powers
     conferred by subsections (1) to (7), with the consent of the persons
     having prior estates or interests in property, whether corpus or
     capital or income, held under an instrument, whether the income is
     directed to be accumulated or not, if such corpus, capital, or income
     is made payable to a class of persons, and the members of that class,
     or some of them, would ultimately, on attaining a specified age or on
     the happening of an event, be entitled to a share of such corpus,
     capital, or income and by survivorship or otherwise may become
     entitled to the shares of the other members of the class, the
     contingencies being equal, the Court may authorise the application
     of, or the trustee company may with the like consent apply, the
     presumptive or contingent shares of infants belonging to the class
     towards their maintenance, education, advancement, or benefit,
     notwithstanding that there may be future members of the class who may
     come into existence.
     (9) Where any member of the class referred to in subsection (8) has
     attained the required age or become entitled by age or otherwise,
     then the consent of that person is necessary to any application under
     that subsection.
     (10) Applications under subsection (8) to the Court may be made by a
     trustee company or by an infant, but nothing in this subsection shall
     be taken as limiting a trustee companyâs power to act under that
     subsection without an authorisation by the Court.
     (11) In construing and giving effect to the respective provisions of
     this section, the one shall be taken in aid of the other, and so that
     each of the provisions can be exercised independently the one of the
     other.

          assets and liabilities of the receiving company (in the

          transferring company) without any transfer, conveyance or
          assignment; and

          as they were assets and liabilities of the transferring
          company) without any transfer, conveyance or assignment;
          and
          (c) to the extent of the transfer, the duties, obligations,
          immunities, rights and privileges applying to the
          transferring company apply to the receiving company.
     (4) If the certificate includes provisions of a kind mentioned in the
     Corporations Act, section 601WBG (3) â
          (a) if the provisions state that particular things are to
          happen or are taken to be the caseâthose things are, by
          force of this section, taken to happen, or to be the case,
          in accordance with those provisions; and
          (b) if the provisions state a mechanism for determining
          things that are to happen or are taken to be the
          caseâthings determined in accordance with the mechanism

          the appropriate way the transfer of an asset or liability
          under the certificate to the receiving company; and
          (b) must, on written application by the receiving company,
          register or record in the appropriate way the transfer of
          an asset or liability under the certificate to the
          receiving company.
     (6) A transaction related to an asset or liability transferred to a
     receiving company entered into by the receiving company in the
     transferring companyâs name or the name of a predecessor in title
     to the transferring company, if effected by an instrument otherwise
     in registrable form, must be registered even though the receiving
     company has not been registered as proprietor of the asset or
     liability.
     (7) If an asset or liability is registered in the name of a receiving
     company, the registrar of titles or other registering authority may
     register a dealing for a transaction about the asset or liability
     without being concerned to enquire whether it is, or is not, an asset
