Note: Section 41B provides an exemption for wages paid or payable for services performed wholly in one or more other countries for a continuous period of more than 6 months. (2) The question of whether wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is, subject to this section, to be determined by reference only to the services performed by the person in respect of the employer during the month in which the wages are paid or payable. (3) For that purpose, any wages paid or payable by an employer in respect of a person in a particular month are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to the services performed by the person in respect of the employer during that month. Note: For example, if wages paid in a month are paid to a person for services performed over several months, the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to services performed by the person in the month in which the wages are paid. The services performed in previous months are disregarded for this purpose.

(5) If no services are performed by a person in respect of an employer during a month in which wages are paid or payable to or in relation to the person by the employer and no services were performed by the person in respect of the employer during any prior month -- (a) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to services performed by the person during the month in which the wages are paid or payable; and (b) the services are taken to have been performed at a place or places where it may be reasonably expected that the services of the person in respect of the employer will be performed. (6) All amounts of wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer in respect of the same person are to be aggregated for the purposes of determining whether they are taxable in this jurisdiction. Note: For example, if one amount of wages is paid by an employer in a particular month for services performed in this jurisdiction, and another amount of wages is paid by the same employer in the same month for services performed by the same person in another Australian jurisdiction, the wages paid are to be aggregated as if they were paid for all the services performed by the person in that month.

(1aa) Except as stated in subsection (1c) or (1d), the Commissioner has to give an exemption on receiving an application from an employer having, or the DGE of a group having, an expected pay-roll tax liability for the assessment year that is not less than the amount applying under subsection (1a)(a) or (b) but is less than -- (a) $100 000; or (b) a greater amount prescribed for the purpose of this subsection by the regulations. (1b) In subsections (1a) and (1aa) -- expected pay-roll tax liability means the amount of pay-roll tax for which the employer or group would be liable in the assessment year if, during that year, the employer, or the employers of the group between them, paid or were liable to pay Australian taxable wages -- (a) equal to those that the employer paid or was liable to pay, or the employers of the group between them paid or were liable to pay, during the immediately preceding assessment year; or (b) if the Commissioner is satisfied that applying paragraph (a) would not result in a reasonable approximation of the wages to be paid in the assessment year, as reasonably assessed by the employer or, in the case of a group, the DGE. (1c) The Commissioner may decline to give an exemption until the applicant provides to the Commissioner sufficient information to justify any assessment under paragraph (b) of the definition of expected pay-roll tax liability in subsection (1b). (1d) The Commissioner may decline to give an exemption if the Commissioner considers that the effect of the exemption would create an unacceptable risk of a person failing to satisfy a liability in accordance with this Act. (2) The Commissioner may, in any other circumstances, exempt an employer from the requirement to lodge monthly returns. (3) The Commissioner may give an exemption on receiving an application or on his or her initiative. (4) An exemption is subject to the conditions (if any) prescribed in the regulations and to the conditions specified in the notice (if any). (4a) An exemption for the members of a group has to apply to every member of the group, and has to result in each member of the group lodging returns at the same frequency. (4b) An exemption under subsection (1a) cannot exclude the operation of subsection (8)(a). (4c) Without limiting any other conditions that can be prescribed or specified, an exemption under subsection (1aa) is on the conditions that -- (a) a return is lodged for each quarter, and the lodging of the return, the form of it, and the information specified in it, are as section 26 would describe if a reference in that section to a month referred to a quarter; and (b) the return is lodged in accordance with section 28A; and (c) any return under section 27 is also lodged in accordance with section 28A. (4d) In subsection (4c) -- quarter means a period of 3 months commencing on 1 July, 1 October, 1 January or 1 April. (5) An exemption continues"
