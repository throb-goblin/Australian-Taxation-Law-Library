      "text": "A large number of Acts and legislative instruments allow people to apply to the Administrative Review Tribunal for review of decisions made under them. The Tribunal is established to review these decisions (known as reviewable decisions).The Tribunal has a President, Deputy Presidents, senior members and general members. There is also a Principal Registrar and staff. This Act deals with their appointment, functions and terms and conditions.This Act contains the standard provisions applying to Tribunal processes. Other legislation can include provisions that apply in addition to, or instead of, these standard provisions.Broadly, a Tribunal process for review of a reviewable decision includes the following stages: (a) a person whose interests are affected by a reviewable decision applies to the Tribunal for review; (b) the applicant, the decision-maker and potentially other persons become parties to the proceeding for the review; (c) the President constitutes the Tribunal for the purposes of the proceeding by deciding which member or members will exercise the Tribunal&#39;s powers for the proceeding; (d) the Tribunal conducts the proceeding, including obtaining evidence and holding hearings, directions hearings and dispute resolution processes; (e) the Tribunal makes its decision.Tribunal powers in relation to the proceeding are exercised by the Tribunal constituted for the purposes of the proceeding or, in some circumstances by the President or by members, the Principal Registrar, registrars and staff members authorised by the President.The Tribunal reviews decisions on their merits. It may affirm, vary or set aside a decision -maker&#39;s decision. If the Tribunal sets aside a decision, it may make a substitute decision or remit the matter to the decision-maker to reconsider as ordered or recommended by the Tribunal.After the Tribunal makes its decision: (a) in some circumstances, a party may apply to refer the matter to the guidance and appeals panel for another review; and (b) a party may appeal to the Federal Court, on a question of law, from the Tribunal&#39;s decision.Special rules apply when the Tribunal&#39;s powers in relation to a proceeding are exercised in the Intelligence and Security jurisdictional area. This occurs if the proceeding relates to an intelligence and security decision or the President otherwise directs (for example where the President is satisfied national security information would be involved).There are requirements for decision-makers in relation to giving notice of decisions and review rights and providing statements of reasons. These apply whether or not an application has been made to the Tribunal for review of the decision.This Act also establishes the Administrative Review Council, with functions relating to the Commonwealth administrative law system. The Council consists of the President, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Information Commissioner and other members appointed by the Governor -General. This Act deals with the appointed members&#39; appointment, functions and terms and conditions."

Other legislation can include provisions that apply in addition to, or instead of, these standard provisions. For example, standard requirements apply to applications to the Tribunal, but other legislation may specify additional or alternative requirements.Practice directions made by the President also deal with various matters relating to Tribunal proceedings and operations. Practice directions must be published.The President decides which member or members will exercise the Tribunal&#39;s powers for a specific proceeding. This is referred to as constituting the Tribunal for the purposes of the proceeding. There are different requirements for constituting the Tribunal for different kinds of proceedings. For other ways the Tribunal&#39;s powers can be exercised, see Division  4 of Part 11.General principles (for example in relation to accessibility and informality) apply to how the Tribunal runs proceedings. Specific requirements also apply to the Tribunal, applicants, decision -makers and other parties to proceedings. There are provisions dealing with the following: (a) participating in proceedings, including representation; (b) ways for parties to stop participating; (c) hearings, directions hearings and dispute resolution processes (together known as Tribunal case events); (d) obtaining and managing evidence and information, including public interest certificates; (e) orders the Tribunal may make in relation to proceedings.The Tribunal may dismiss an application without making a decision in some circumstances. Otherwise, in a review of a reviewable decision, the Tribunal must affirm, vary or set aside the decision. If the Tribunal sets aside the decision, it may make a substitute decision or remit the matter to the decision -maker to reconsider as ordered or recommended by the Tribunal.The timing and effect of some Tribunal decisions is set out. Once decisions are made, requirements apply to the Tribunal in relation to giving notice, giving statements of reasons and publishing decisions.Some guidance and appeals panel decisions are specified to be Tribunal guidance decisions. The Tribunal must have regard to these decisions in some future proceedings.There are a number of offences applying to giving evidence, non-publication and non -disclosure orders and contempt."

Timeframes apply to applications, but may be extended in some circumstances. The application to refer the matter does not affect the operation of the Tribunal decision unless the Tribunal orders otherwise.If the President decides to refer the matter to the guidance and appeals panel, the Tribunal constituted as the guidance and appeals panel reviews the decision of the decision -maker, as affected by the earlier Tribunal review. Some different Tribunal powers and procedures apply in relation to guidance and appeals panel proceedings.Only some kinds of Tribunal decisions can be referred to the guidance and appeals panel. For these decisions, a party to the proceeding in which the Tribunal decision is made can choose to apply to refer the matter to the guidance and appeals or to appeal on a question of law to the Federal Court under Part  7.This Part contains the standard provisions for guidance and appeals panel proceedings. Other legislation can include provisions that apply in addition to, or instead of, these standard provisions."
