                               Trustees Act 1962

                               Western Australia
                               Trustees Act 1962

6 months, or for such less period as may be specified, the whole of the
purchase money shall become due and payable; and
(d) the purchaser shall maintain and protect the property, and, in the case of
land, keep all buildings (if any) thereon insured against loss or damage by
fire to their full insurable value.
(4) Notwithstanding that the property has been sold on terms of deferred
payment, the trustee may, at any time after one-third of the purchase money has
been paid, convey the property and take a mortgage back to secure payment of
the balance of the purchase money and interest, with or without the security of
any other property.
(5) Whether the sale is made under the order of the Court or otherwise, the
Court may make such order as it thinks fit as to the terms of deferred payment.
(7) For the purposes of any consent or direction required by the instrument
(if any) creating the trust or by statute, a trustee selling property on terms
of deferred payment shall be deemed not to be lending money or investing trust
funds.

35. Onerous leases or property may be surrendered

(1) Where a leasehold is vested in a trustee and the property is subject to
onerous covenants of such a nature that it would not be in the interests of the
beneficiaries to retain the property, the trustee may surrender, or concur in
surrendering, the lease; and the trustee shall not be chargeable with breach of
trust nor shall the surrender be impeached by any beneficiary upon the ground
only that the covenants were not of such a nature, if the trustee has acted
bona fide and on the advice of a person whom he reasonably believed to be a
competent valuer instructed and employed independently of the lessor, whether
the valuer carried on business in the locality where the property is situate or
elsewhere.
(2) Where a freehold is vested in a trustee and the property is of so onerous a
nature that it would not be in the interests of the beneficiaries to retain the
property, if the Crown agrees to accept the surrender of the freehold, the
trustee may surrender, or concur in surrendering, it to the Crown; and the
trustee shall not be chargeable with breach of trust nor shall the surrender be
impeached by any beneficiary upon the ground only that the property was not of
such a nature, if the trustee has acted bona fide and on the advice of a person
whom he reasonably believed to be a competent valuer, whether that valuer
carried on business in the locality where the property is situate or elsewhere.
(3) A subsequent purchaser or the Registrar of Titles or other person
registering or certifying title shall not be concerned to inquire whether a
surrender was authorised by this section.

36. Leases may be renewed

(1) A trustee of any leaseholds for lives or years that are renewable under any
covenant or contract or by custom or usual practice may, if he thinks fit, and
shall, if thereto required by any person having any beneficial interest,
present or future or contingent, in the leaseholds, use his best endeavours to
obtain from time to time a renewed lease of the same hereditaments on the
agreed or reasonable terms, and for that purpose may from time to time make or
concur in making a surrender of the lease for the time being subsisting, and do
all such other acts as are requisite; but where, by the terms of the instrument
(if any) creating the trust, the person in possession for his life or other
limited interest is entitled to enjoy the same without any obligation to renew,
or to contribute to the expense of renewal, this section does not apply unless
the consent in writing of that person is obtained to the renewal.
(2) A trustee obtaining a renewal of a lease under the powers conferred by this
section or otherwise may pay or apply capital money subject to the trust, for
the purpose of obtaining the renewal.

37. Equity of redemption may be purchased instead of foreclosing

A trustee may, in lieu of proceeding to foreclosure, purchase the equity of
redemption of land in the State the subject of a mortgage held by the trustee
under which default has been made where the moneys expended in that purchase
are subject to the same trusts as the mortgage debt; but in no case shall the
moneys paid by way of consideration for such purchase exceed 5% of the amount
due under the mortgage.

38. Property may be sold after right of redemption barred

(1) Where any property is vested in a trustee by way of security, and the
property becomes discharged from the right of redemption whether by virtue of
the Limitation Act 2005 or of any order for foreclosure or purchase of the
equity of redemption or otherwise, the trustee shall hold the property on trust
for sale.
(2) The net proceeds of sale of any property to which this section relates
shall, after payment of costs and expenses, be applied in like manner as the
mortgage debt, if received, would have been applicable, and the income of the
property until sale shall be applied in like manner as the interest, if
received, would have been applicable.
(3) This section does not affect the right of any person to require that,
instead of a sale, the property shall be conveyed to him or in accordance with
his directions.

39. Equity of redemption may be released in discharge of mortgage debt

(1) Where an equity of redemption is vested in a trustee and the mortgaged
property is not of greater value than the amount of the mortgage debt, the
trustee may release the equity of redemption to the mortgagee in discharge of
the mortgage debt or part thereof; and the trustee shall not be chargeable with
breach of trust nor shall the release be impeached by any beneficiary upon the
ground only that the mortgaged property was of greater value than the amount of
the mortgage debt or the part thereof discharged, if the trustee has acted
bona fide and on the advice of a person whom he reasonably believed to be a
competent valuer instructed and employed independently of the mortgagee,
whether the valuer carried on business in the locality where the property is
situate or elsewhere.
(2) A subsequent purchaser or the Registrar of Titles or other person
registering or certifying title shall not be concerned to inquire whether a
release was authorised by this section.

40. Trustee as mortgagee in possession, application of income by

(1) Where a trustee is entitled, whether severally or as a co-mortgagee, to a
debt secured by a mortgage of land in trust as to the whole or part of that
debt for persons by way of succession, and the trustee is at the date of
commencement of this Act, or at any time after that date becomes, mortgagee in
possession of the mortgaged land, the trustee shall apply the net income of the
mortgaged land received by him after that date or after he becomes mortgagee in
possession -- 
(a) in discharge of all rents, taxes, rates, and outgoings affecting the
mortgaged land; and
(b) in payment of the premiums on any insurances properly payable on the
mortgaged property; and
(c) in keeping down all annual sums or other payments and the interest on all
principal sums having priority to the mortgage in right whereof he is in
possession;
and subject to the rights of the mortgagor, the trustee shall hold the residue
of the income so received by him upon the trusts to which the mortgage debt is
subject.
(2) The rents, taxes, outgoings, premiums, costs, annual sums, payments and
interest to be discharged, kept down and paid, pursuant to subsection (1),
shall be those accruing due -- 
(a) after the date of the commencement of this Act, where the trustee is in
possession of the mortgaged land at that date; and
(b) after the date of possession by the trustee, where the entry into
possession is after the date of commencement of this Act;
but if at the date of commencement of this Act, or on the date of possession by
the trustee, as the case may be, any rents, taxes, rates, outgoings, annual
sums, payments, interest or premiums mentioned in subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c)
were or are due and unpaid, and such of those rents, taxes, rates, outgoings,
annual sums, payments and premiums as are periodic payments were payable wholly
or in part in respect of any period subsequent to the date of commencement or
to the date of possession, as the case may be, then the lastmentioned rents,
taxes, rates, outgoings, annual sums, payments, and premiums shall, for the
purpose of this section, be considered as accruing from day to day and shall be
apportionable in respect of time accordingly.
(3) On the recovery of the moneys secured by the mortgage, whether in whole or
in part, and whether by repayment or on realisation of the security or
otherwise, such part of the income applied by the trustee in the payments
specified in subsection (1)(a), (b) and (c) as would otherwise have been
payable as interest to the person entitled to the interest of the mortgage debt
shall, as between the persons respectively entitled to the income and corpus of
the mortgage debt, be deemed to be arrears of interest and the amount received
by the trustee shall be apportioned accordingly.
(4) Notwithstanding anything in this section contained, the trustee may, if in
the administration of the trust he thinks it necessary so to do, apply income
of the mortgaged property received by him after the date of commencement of
this Act in payment of any rents, taxes, rates, outgoings, premiums, costs,
annual sums, payments, and interest affecting the mortgaged land other than
those specified in subsection (2); but the person entitled to the interest on
the mortgage debt shall be entitled to recoupment out of the capital of the
mortgage debt of all payments made by the trustee under the authority conferred
by this subsection.

41. Receipts may be given

(1) The receipt in writing of a trustee for any money, securities or other
personal property or effects payable, transferable or deliverable to him under
any trust or power is a sufficient discharge to the person paying, transferring
or delivering it or them, and effectually exonerates that person from seeing to
the application, or being answerable for any loss or misapplication, of the
money, securities or other personal property or effects.
(2) This section applies notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the instrument (if any) creating the trust.

42. Property, debts, etc., miscellaneous powers as to

A trustee may, if and as he thinks fit -- 
(a) accept any property, real or personal, before the time at which it is made
transferable or payable; or
(b) sever and apportion any blended trust funds or property; or
(c) pay or allow any debt or claim on any evidence that he thinks sufficient;
or
(d) accept any composition or any security, real or personal, for any debt or
for any property, real or personal, claimed; or
(e) allow any time for payment of any debt; or
(f) compromise, compound, abandon, submit to arbitration or otherwise settle
any debt, account, claim or thing whatever relating to the trust or to the
trust property;
and for any of those purposes may enter into, give, execute, and do such
agreements, instruments of composition or arrangement, releases, and other
things as to him seem expedient, without being responsible for any loss
occasioned by any act or thing so done by him in good faith.

43. Capital money may be raised by sale, mortgage, etc. of trust property

(1) Where a trustee is authorised by the instrument (if any) creating the trust
or by or under this Act or any other Act or by law to pay or apply capital
money subject to the trust for any purpose or in any manner, he has and shall
be deemed always to have had power to raise the money required by sale,
conversion, calling in or mortgage of all or any part of the trust property for
the time being in possession; and where a trustee, in the exercise of his
powers in that behalf, purchases any property for the trust, he has and shall
be deemed always to have had power to make the purchase on terms of deferred
payment or on mortgage of that property.
(2) This section applies notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the instrument (if any) creating the trust.

44. Purchasers etc. dealing with trustees, protection for

A purchaser or mortgagee, paying or advancing money on a sale or mortgage
purporting to be made under any trust or power (statutory or otherwise) vested
in a trustee, shall not be concerned to see that the money is wanted, or that
no more than is wanted is raised, or otherwise as to the application thereof.

45. Trustees dying, devolution of powers or trusts

(1) Where a power or trust is given to, or imposed on, 2 or more trustees
jointly, then, unless the contrary is expressed in the instrument (if any)
creating the power or trust, the power or trust may be exercised or performed
for the time being by the survivors or survivor of them.
(2) Until the appointment of a new trustee, the personal representative for the
time being of a sole trustee or (where there were 2 or more trustees) of the
last surviving or continuing trustee shall be capable of exercising or
performing any power or trust that was given to, or capable of being exercised
by, the sole or last surviving or continuing trustee, or other trustees for the
time being of the trust; but for the purposes of this subsection the term
trustee does not include a personal representative as such.
(3) This section does not authorise the exercise or performance of any power or
trust by an executor who has renounced or has not proved.

46. Insuring trust property

(1) A trustee may insure against loss or damage, whether by fire or otherwise,
any insurable property to any amount, including the amount of any insurance
already on foot, not exceeding the full replacement value of the property; and
may also insure against any risk or liability against which it would be prudent
for a person to insure, if he were acting for himself; and may pay the premiums
for the insurance out of the income of the property concerned or out of the
income of any other property subject to the same trusts, without obtaining the
consent of any person who may be entitled wholly or partly to that income.
(2) A trustee may recover the amounts of any premiums paid in respect of any
insurance properly effected from the life tenant or other person entitled to or
in receipt of the rents and profits of the property concerned.
(3) Nothing in this section imposes any obligation on a trustee to insure or to
insure for any particular value or sum.

47. Insurance money, application of

(1) Money receivable by a trustee or any beneficiary under a policy of
insurance against the loss of, or damage to, any property subject to a trust,
whether by fire or otherwise, (in this section called insurance money) shall,
where the policy has been kept up under any trust in that behalf or under any
power (statutory or otherwise) or in performance of any covenant or of any
obligation (statutory or otherwise) or by a tenant for life impeachable for
waste, be capital for the purposes of the trust, except so far as it would be
regarded as income under any rule of law.
(2) If any insurance money is receivable by any person other than the trustee
of the trust, that person shall use his best endeavours to recover and receive
the money, and shall pay the net residue thereof, after discharging any costs
of recovering and receiving it, to the trustee of the trust, or, if there is no
trustee capable of giving a discharge therefor, into Court.
(3) Any insurance money, receivable in respect of property held upon trust for
sale, shall be held upon the trusts and subject to the powers and provisions
applicable to money arising by a sale under the trust; and, in any other case,
shall be held upon trusts corresponding as nearly as may be with the trusts
affecting the property in respect of which it was payable.
(4) Any insurance money, or any part thereof, may be applied by the trustee,
or, if in Court, under the direction of the Court, in rebuilding, reinstating,
replacing or repairing the property lost or damaged; but any such application
by the trustee shall be subject to the consent of any person whose consent is
required by the instrument (if any) creating the trust to the investment of
money subject to the trust.
(5) Nothing in this section affects the right of any person to require any
insurance money or any part thereof to be applied in rebuilding, reinstating or
repairing the property lost or damaged, or the rights of any mortgagee, lessor
or lessee, whether under any statute or otherwise.
(6) This section applies to policies effected either before or after the
commencement of this Act, but only to money received after that commencement.

48. Trust's documents may be put in safe custody

A trustee may deposit any document held by him relating to the trust, or to the
trust property, with any bank or corporation whose business includes the
undertaking of the safe custody of documents, and any sum payable in respect of
any such deposit shall be paid out of the income of the trust property, and so
far as there is no available income out of the capital of the trust property.

49. Reversionary interests, powers as to

(1) Where trust property includes any share or interest in property not vested
in the trustee, or the proceeds of sale of any such property, or any other
thing in action, the trustee, on its or their falling into possession or
becoming payable or transferable, may -- 
(a) agree or ascertain the amount or value thereof or any part thereof in such
manner as he thinks fit; and
(b) accept in or towards satisfaction thereof, at the market or current value,
or upon any valuation or estimate of value that he may think fit, any
investments in which trust funds may be invested under this Act; and
(c) allow any deductions for duties, costs, charges, and expenses that he
thinks proper or reasonable; and
(d) execute any release in respect thereof, so as effectually to discharge all
accountable parties from all liability in respect of any matter coming within
the scope of the release,
without being responsible for any loss occasioned by any act or thing so done
by him in good faith.
(2) The trustee shall not be under any obligation and shall not be chargeable
with any breach of trust by reason of any omission -- 
(a) to give any notice in respect of, or apply for any charging or other like
order upon, any securities or other property out of or in which the share or
interest or other thing in action mentioned in subsection (1) is derived,
payable or charged; or
(b) to take any proceedings on account of any act, default or neglect on the
part of the persons in whom the securities or other property mentioned in
paragraph (a) or any of them or any part of them are for the time being, or had
at any time been, vested,
unless and until required in writing so to do by some person, or the guardian
of some person, beneficially interested under the trust, and unless also due
provision is made to his satisfaction for payment of the costs of any
proceedings required to be taken.
(3) Nothing in subsection (2) relieves the trustee of the obligation to get in
and obtain payment or transfer of the share or interest or other thing in
action upon its falling into possession.

50. Valuation of trust property, powers as to

(1) A trustee may, for the purpose of giving effect to the trust, or any of the
provisions of the instrument (if any) creating the trust or of this Act or any
other Act, from time to time ascertain and fix the value of any trust property,
or of any property that he is authorised to purchase or otherwise acquire, in
such manner as he thinks proper; and where the trustee is not personally
qualified to ascertain the value of any property he shall consult a duly
qualified person (whether employed by him or not) as to that value; but the
trustee shall not be bound to accept any valuation made by any person whom the
trustee may consult.
(2) Any valuation made by the trustee in good faith under this section is
binding on all persons beneficially interested under the trust.

51. Trust's accounts, audit of

(1) A trustee may, in his absolute discretion, from time to time, cause the
accounts of the trust property to be examined or audited by a person who
publicly carries on the business of an accountant, and shall for that purpose
produce such vouchers and give such information to that person as he may
require.
(2) The costs of the examination or audit, including the fee of the person
making the examination or audit, shall be charged against the capital or income
of the trust property, or partly in one way and partly in the other, as the
trustee may in his absolute discretion think fit, but, in default of any
direction by the trustee to the contrary in any special case, costs
attributable to capital shall be borne by capital and those attributable to
income by income.
(3) Where the trustee, or one of the trustees, is the Public Trustee or an
incorporated company, nothing in this section authorises, except in the case of
a business forming part of the trust property, any costs or fee to be paid out
of, or borne by, the capital or income of the trust property, unless the Court
approves of the costs or fee being so paid out or borne.

52. Co-owners, power to act in conjunction with

Where an undivided share in any property is subject to a trust, the trustee may
(without prejudice to any trust or power in relation to the entirety of the
property) execute or exercise any trust or power vested in him in relation to
that share in conjunction with the persons entitled to, or having power in that
behalf over, the other share or shares, and notwithstanding that the trustee or
any one or more of several trustees may be entitled to or interested in any
such share, either in his or their own right or in a fiduciary capacity.

53. Agents, attorneys, etc., power to employ

(1) A trustee may, instead of acting personally, employ and pay an agent,
whether a solicitor, accountant, bank, trustee corporation, stockbroker or
other person, to transact any business or do any act required to be transacted
or done in the execution of the trust or the administration of the trust
property, including the receipt and payment of money, and the keeping and audit
of trust accounts, and shall be entitled to be allowed and paid all charges and
expenses so incurred, and shall not be responsible for the default of any such
agent employed in good faith and without negligence.
(2) A trustee may appoint any person to act as his agent or attorney for the
purpose of selling, converting, collecting, getting in, and executing and
perfecting assurances of, or managing or cultivating, or otherwise
administering any property real or personal, movable or immovable, subject to
the trust in any place outside the State, or executing or exercising any
discretion or trust or power vested in him in relation to any such property,
with such ancillary powers, and with and subject to such provisions and
restrictions, as he may think fit, including a power to appoint substitutes,
and shall not, by reason only of his having made any such appointment, be
responsible for any loss arising thereby.
(3) Without limiting the generality of the powers conferred by subsections (1)
and (2), a trustee may -- 
(a) appoint a solicitor to be his agent to receive and give a discharge for any
money or valuable consideration or property receivable by the trustee under the
trust, by permitting the solicitor to have the custody of, and to produce, a
deed or instrument having in the body thereof or endorsed thereon a receipt for
the money or valuable consideration or property, the deed or instrument being
executed, or the endorsed receipt being signed, by the person entitled to give
a receipt for that consideration; or
(b) appoint a bank or solicitor to be his agent to receive and give a discharge
for any money payable to the trustee under or by virtue of a policy of
insurance, by permitting the bank or solicitor to have the custody of and to
produce the policy of insurance with a receipt signed by the trustee,
and the production, by the solicitor, of any such deed or instrument as is
mentioned in paragraph (a) shall have the same validity and effect as if the
person appointing the solicitor had not been a trustee.
(4) A trustee shall not be chargeable with a breach of trust, by reason only of
his having made, or concurred in making, any appointment such as is mentioned
in subsection (3); but nothing in that subsection exempts a trustee from any
liability that he would have incurred if this Act and any enactment replaced by
this Act had not been passed, where he permits any money, valuable
consideration or property therein mentioned to remain in the hands or under the
control of the bank or solicitor for a longer period than is reasonably
necessary to enable the bank or solicitor, as the case may be, to pay or
transfer it to the trustee.
(5) Subsections (3) and (4) apply whether the money or valuable consideration
or property was or is received before or after the commencement of this Act.

54. Delegation of trustees' powers during absence from State or incapacity

(1) A trustee who for the time being is out of the State or is about to depart
therefrom, or is a member of Her Majesty's forces, or who is, or may be about
to become, by reason of physical infirmity, temporarily incapable of performing
all his duties as a trustee may, subject to the provisions of this section, but
notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, by power of attorney
executed as a deed, delegate to any person the execution or exercise during his
absence from the State or during his incapacity, as the case may be, of all or
any trusts, powers, authorities, and discretions vested in him as such trustee,
whether alone or jointly with any other person or persons; but a person being
the only other co-trustee and not being a trustee corporation shall not be
appointed to be an attorney under this subsection.
(2) Notwithstanding the power to delegate conferred by subsection (1), a
trustee may not so delegate unless his co-trustees or co-trustee (if any) and
such other person as is empowered by the instrument (if any) creating the trust
to appoint trustees, consent by the same or other deed to the delegation.
(3) Where any delegation has under this section been duly made to and accepted
by any person and is for the time being in operation, that person has, within
the scope of the delegation, the same trusts, powers, authorities, discretions,
liabilities, and responsibilities (except the power of delegation conferred by
this section) as he would have if he were then the trustee.
(4) In any proceedings brought by any person beneficially interested under the
trust against the donor of a power of attorney given under this section, in
respect of any act or default of the donee of the power, it is a defence for
the donor to prove that the donee was appointed by him in good faith and
without negligence.
(5) All jurisdictions and powers of any Court apply to the donee of a power of
attorney given under this section in the same manner, so far as respects the
execution of the trust or the administration of the estate to which the power
of attorney relates, as if the donee were acting in relation to the trust or
estate in the same capacity as the donor of the power.
(6) A power of attorney given under this section does not come into operation
unless and until the donor is out of the State or is incapable of performing
all his duties as a trustee, and is revoked by his return or by his recovery of
that capacity, as the case may be.
(7) In favour of any person dealing with the donee of a power of attorney given
under this section, any act done or instrument executed by the donee is,
notwithstanding that the power has never come into operation or has been
revoked, whether by the act of the donor of the power or by operation of law,
as valid and effectual as if the power had come into operation and remained
unrevoked at the time when the act was done or the instrument executed, unless
that person had at that time actual notice that the power had never come into
operation or of the revocation of the power.
(8) In favour of any person dealing with the donee of a power of attorney given
under this section, any act done or instrument executed by the donee is,
notwithstanding that any consents to the delegation that are required by
subsection (2) have not been given, as valid and effectual as if those consents
had been properly given, unless that person had at the time when the act was
done or the instrument was executed actual notice that those consents had not
been given.
(9) A statutory declaration by the donee of a power of attorney given under
this section relating to any trust or estate that the power has come into
operation, or that in any transaction the donee is acting in the execution of
the trust or the administration of the estate, is, in favour of a person
dealing with the donee of the power, conclusive evidence of that fact.
(10) The fact that it appears from any power of attorney given under this
section, or from any evidence required for the purposes of any power of
attorney or otherwise, that in any transaction the donee of the power is acting
in the execution of a trust shall not affect with notice of the trust any
person dealing in good faith with the donee.
(11) Where it is intended that the donee of a power of attorney given under
this section shall be entitled to transfer, or otherwise deal with, land under
the operation of the Transfer of Land Act 1893, the power of attorney shall be
in the form, and executed and attested in the manner, prescribed by Part VI of
that Act.

55. Business, trade, etc. of deceased, power to carry on

(1) Subject to the provisions of any other Act, if at the time of his death any
person is engaged (whether alone or in partnership) in carrying on a business,
trade or occupation, it shall be lawful for his trustee to continue to carry on
that business, trade or occupation, in the same manner, for any one or more of
the following periods, namely -- 
(a) 2 years from the death of that person; or
(b) such period as may be necessary or desirable for the winding up of the
business; or
(c) such further period or periods as the Court may approve.
(2) In exercise of the powers conferred by this section or by the instrument
creating the trust, a trustee may -- 
(a) employ any part of the deceased's estate that is subject to the same
trusts; and
(b) from time to time increase or diminish the part of the estate employed as
provided by paragraph (a); and
(c) purchase stock, machinery, implements, and chattels for the purpose of the
business mentioned in subsection (1); and
(d) employ such managers, agents, servants, clerks, workmen and others as he
thinks fit; and
(e) at any time enter into a partnership agreement to take the place of any
partnership agreement subsisting immediately before the death of the deceased
or at any time thereafter and notwithstanding that the trustee was a partner of
the deceased in his own right; and
(f) enter into share-farming agreements.
(3) Application to the Court for leave to carry on a business may be made by
the trustee or any person beneficially interested in the estate at any time,
whether or not any previous authority to carry on the business has expired; and
the Court may make such an order, or may order that the business be not carried
on, or be carried on subject to conditions, or may make such other order as, in
the circumstances, it thinks fit.
(4) Nothing in this section affects any other authority to do the acts thereby
authorised to be done.
(5) Where a trustee is in any manner interested or concerned in a trade or
business, he may make such subscriptions as it would be prudent for him to
make, if he were acting for himself, out of the income of the assets affected,
to any fund created for objects or purposes in support of any trade or business
of a like nature and subscribed to by other persons engaged in a like trade or
business.

56. Business, power to convert into, or sell to, a company

(1) A trustee may at any time, at the expense of the trust property, convert or
join in converting any business into a company limited by shares in such manner
as he thinks fit; and may, at the like expense, promote and assist in promoting
a company for taking over the business; and may sell or transfer the business
and the capital and assets and goodwill thereof, or any part thereof, to the
company, or to any company having for its objects the purchase of such a
business, in consideration, in either case, wholly or in part of ordinary or
preference shares wholly or partially paid up of any such company, or wholly or
in part of debentures, debenture stock, or bonds of any such company, and as to
the balance (if any) in cash payable immediately, or by any instalments with or
without security.
(2) A trustee may retain as an investment of the trust any shares, debentures,
debenture stock or bonds received by him in consequence of the exercise by him
of any power conferred by subsection (1).

57. Trustee may sue himself in a different capacity

Notwithstanding any rule of law or practice to the contrary, a trustee of any
property in that capacity may sue, and be sued by, himself in any other
capacity whatsoever, including his personal capacity; but in every such case
the trustee shall obtain the directions of the Court in which the proceedings
are taken, as to the manner in which the opposing interests are to be
represented.

            Part V -- Maintenance, advancement and protective trusts

58. Infant beneficiary, application of income until 18

(1) Where any property is held by a trustee in trust for any person for any
interest whatsoever, whether vested or contingent, then, subject to any prior
interests or charges affecting that property -- 
(a) during the infancy of that person, if his interest so long continues, the
trustee may, at his sole discretion, pay to his parent or guardian (if any) or
otherwise apply for or towards his maintenance, education (including past
maintenance or education) or his advancement or benefit, the whole or such
part, if any, of the income of that property as may, in all the circumstances,
be reasonable, whether or not there is -- 
(i) any other fund applicable to the same purpose; or
(ii) any person bound by law to provide for his maintenance, education,
advancement or benefit;
and
(b) if the person on attaining the age of 18 years has not a vested interest in
that income, the trustee shall thenceforth pay the income of that property and
of any accretion thereto, under subsection (2), to him until he either attains
a vested interest therein or dies, or until failure of his interest;
but, in deciding whether the whole or any part of the income of the property is
during a minority to be paid or applied for the purposes in this subsection
mentioned, the trustee shall have regard to the age of the infant and his
requirements and, generally, to the circumstances of the case, and in
particular to what other income (if any) is applicable for the same purposes;
and where the trustee has notice that the income of more than one fund is
applicable for those purposes, then, so far as practicable, unless the entire
income of the funds is paid or applied for those purposes or the Court
otherwise directs, a proportionate part only of the income of each fund shall
be so paid or applied.
(2) During the infancy of any such person as is mentioned in subsection (1), if
his interest so long continues, the trustee shall accumulate all the residue of
that income in the way of compound interest by investing it and the resulting
income thereof from time to time in investments in which trust funds may be
invested under this Act, and shall hold those accumulations -- 
(a) if the person -- 
(i) attains the age of 18 years, or marries under that age, and his interest in
the income during his infancy or until his marriage is a vested interest; or
(ii) on attaining the age of 18 years or on marriage under that age becomes
entitled to the property from which the income arose in fee simple, absolute or
determinable, or absolutely, or for an entailed interest,
in trust for that person absolutely, but without prejudice to any provisions
with respect thereto contained in any settlement by him made under any
statutory power during his infancy, and so that the receipt of that person
after marriage, and though still an infant, shall be a good discharge; and
(b) in any other case, notwithstanding that the person had a vested interest in
the income, as an accretion to the capital of the property from which the
accumulations arose and as one fund with that capital for all purposes;
but the trustee may, at any time during the infancy of that person if his
interest so long continues, apply those accumulations, or any part thereof, as
if they were income arising in the then current year.
(3) This section applies in the case of a contingent interest, only if the
limitation or trust carries the intermediate income of the property held in
trust, but it applies to a future or contingent legacy by the parent of, or a
person standing in loco parentis to, the legatee, if and for such period as,
under the general law, the legacy carries interest for the maintenance of the
legatee, and in the latter case the rate of interest shall (if the income
available is sufficient and subject to any rules of Court to the contrary) be
5% per annum; and where in the case of a contingent interest the limitation or
trust would, but for the operation of a protective trust (whether created or
statutory) carry the intermediate income of the property, that limitation or
trust shall for the purposes of this subsection be deemed, notwithstanding the
protective trust, to carry the intermediate income.
(4) This section applies to a vested annuity in like manner as if the annuity
were the income of property held by a trustee in trust to pay the income
thereof to the annuitant for the same period for which the annuity is payable,
save that in any case accumulations made during the infancy of the annuitant
shall be held in trust for the annuitant or his personal representative
absolutely.
[Section 58 amended: No. 113 of 1965 s. 8; No. 46 of 1972 s. 6(2); No. 1 of
1997 s. 13.]

59. Capital may be applied for maintenance, education, etc.

A trustee may at any time or times pay or apply any capital money or other
capital asset subject to a trust, for the maintenance, education (including
past maintenance or education), or the advancement or benefit, in such manner
as he may in his absolute discretion think fit, of any person entitled to the
capital of the trust property or any share thereof, whether absolutely or
contingently on his attaining any specified age or on the occurrence of any
other event, or subject to a gift over on his death under any specified age or
on the occurrence of any other event, and whether in possession or in remainder
or reversion, and any such payment or application may be made notwithstanding
that the interest of that person is liable to be defeated by the exercise of a
power of appointment or revocation or by the operation of the rule against
perpetuities or to be diminished by the increase of the class to which he
belongs; but -- 
(a) the money or asset so paid or applied for the maintenance, education,
advancement or benefit of any person shall not exceed altogether $2 000 or half
of the presumptive or vested share or interest of that person in the trust
property, whichever is the greater; and
(b) where that person or any other person is or becomes absolutely and
indefeasibly entitled to the share of the trust property in which that person
had a presumptive or vested interest when the money or asset was so paid or
applied, that money or asset shall be brought into account as part of that
share of the trust property; and
(c) that payment or application shall not be made so as to prejudice any person
entitled to any prior life or other interest, whether vested or contingent, in
the money or asset paid or applied, unless that person is in existence and of
full age and consents in writing to the payment or application, or unless the
Court, on the application of the trustee, so orders.

60. Advances for maintenance etc. may be made conditionally

(1) Where a power to pay or apply any property for the maintenance, education,
advancement or benefit of any person or for any one or more of those purposes
is vested in a trustee, the trustee when exercising the power shall have, and
be deemed always to have had, authority to impose on the person any condition,
whether as to repayment, payment of interest, giving security, or otherwise;
and at any time after imposing any such condition, the trustee may, either
wholly or in part, waive the condition or release any obligation undertaken or
any security given by reason of the condition.
(2) In determining the amount or value of the property that a trustee, who has
imposed a condition pursuant to subsection (1), may pay or apply in exercise of
his powers in that regard, any money repaid to the trustee or recovered by him
shall be deemed not to have been so paid or applied by the trustee.
(3) Nothing in this section imposes upon a trustee any obligation to impose any
condition pursuant to subsection (1); and a trustee, when imposing any
condition as to giving security, shall not be affected by any restrictions upon
the investment of trust funds, whether imposed by this Act or by any rule of
law or by the trust instrument (if any).
(4) A trustee is not liable for any loss which may be incurred in respect of
any money that is paid or applied under this section, whether the loss arises
through failure to take security, through the security being insufficient,
through failure to take action for its protection, through the release or
abandonment of the security without payment, or from any other cause.

61. Protective trusts, rules as to

(1) Where any income, including an annuity or other periodic income payment, is
directed to be held on protective trusts for the benefit of any person (in
this section called the principal beneficiary) for the period of his life or
any less period, then during that period (in this section called the trust
period) that income shall, without prejudice to any prior interest, be held on
trust as by this section provided.
(2) The income to which this section refers shall be held on trust for the
principal beneficiary during the trust period or until, whether before or after
the termination of any prior interest -- 
(a) the principal beneficiary does, or attempts to do, or suffers, any act or
thing; or
(b) any event, other than an advance under any statutory or express power,
happens,
whereby, if the income were payable during the trust period to the principal
beneficiary absolutely during that period, he would be deprived of the right to
receive it or any part of it; and, in any of those cases, as well as on the
termination of the trust period, whichever first happens, this trust of the
income shall fail and determine.
(3) Where the trust, to which subsection (2) refers, fails or determines during
the subsistence of the trust period, then, during the remainder of that period,
the income to which that subsection refers shall be held upon trust for the
application thereof for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of
all, or any one or more exclusively of the other or others, of -- 
(a) the principal beneficiary and his, or her, spouse or de facto partner (if
any) and his, or her, children or more remote issue (if any); or
(b) where there is no spouse or de facto partner or issue of the principal
beneficiary in existence, the principal beneficiary and the persons who would,
if he were dead, be entitled to the trust property or the income thereof or the
annuity fund (if any) or arrears of the annuity,
as the trustee, in his absolute discretion and without being liable to account
for the exercise of that discretion, thinks fit.
(4) This section does not apply to trusts coming into operation before the
commencement of this Act, and has effect subject to any variation, contained in
the instrument creating the trust, of the trusts declared by subsections (2)
and (3).
(5) Nothing in this section operates to validate any trust that would, if
contained in the instrument creating the trust, be liable to be set aside.

            Part VI -- Indemnities and protection of trustees, etc.

62. Leases etc., trustees' liability under

(1) Where a trustee liable as such for -- 
(a) any rent, covenant or agreement reserved by, or contained in, any lease; or
(b) any rent, covenant or agreement payable under, or contained in, any grant
made in consideration of a rent charge; or
(c) any indemnity given in respect of any rent, covenant or agreement referred
to in either paragraph (a) or (b),
satisfies all liabilities under the lease or grant that may have accrued and
been claimed up to the date of the conveyance hereinafter in this subsection
mentioned, and, where necessary, sets apart a sufficient fund to answer any
future claim that may be made in respect of any fixed and ascertained sum that
the lessee or grantee agreed to lay out on the property demised or granted,
although the period for laying out that sum may not have arrived, then, and in
any such case, the trustee may convey the property demised or granted to a
purchaser, legatee, devisee or other person entitled to call for a conveyance
thereof; and may thereafter distribute the trust estate, other than the fund
(if any) set apart under this subsection, to or amongst the persons entitled
thereto, without appropriating any part, or any further part, as the case may
be, of the trust estate to meet any future liability under the said lease or
grant; and notwithstanding that distribution, the trustee shall not be
personally liable in respect of any subsequent claim under the lease or grant.
(2) For the purposes of this section a trustee shall be deemed to be liable as
such for any liabilities arising from privity of estate that he may incur under
the obligations contained in a lease or grant, if he is entitled to reimburse
himself out of the trust property for all expenses he may incur in respect of
the liabilities.
(3) This section operates without prejudice to the right of the lessor or
grantor, or the persons deriving title under the lessor or grantor, to follow
the trust property or any part thereof or any property representing that
property into the hands of the persons amongst whom it may have been
distributed, and applies notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
instrument (if any) creating the trust.
(4) In this section lease includes a sublease and an agreement for a lease or
sublease and any instrument giving any such indemnity as is mentioned in
subsection (1) or varying the liabilities under the lease; grant applies to a
grant whether the rent is created by limitation, grant, reservation or
otherwise, and includes an agreement for a grant and any instrument giving any
such mentioned indemnity or varying the liabilities under the grant; and lessee
and grantee include persons respectively deriving title under a lessee or
grantee.

63. Deceased estate, advertising for claims against, trustees' protection

(1) Where a trustee has given notice by advertisement published at least once
in the Government Gazette and in a newspaper circulating in each locality in
which, in the opinion of the trustee, claims are likely to arise, requiring
persons having claims to which this section applies to send to the trustee,
within the time fixed in the notice, particulars of their claims and warning
them of the consequences of their failure to do so, then, at the expiration of
that time or at any time thereafter, the trustee may administer or distribute
the property or any part thereof to which the notice relates to or among the
persons entitled thereto having regard only to the claims, whether formal or
not, of which the trustee then has notice; and he shall not, as respects the
property so administered or distributed, be liable to any person of whose claim
he has not had notice at the time of the administration or distribution.
(2) Nothing in this section affects any remedy that a person may have under
section 65 or any other right or remedy available to him against any person
other than the trustee, including any right that he may have to follow the
property and any money or property into which it is converted.
(3) The time to be fixed by any notice, published in accordance with
subsection (1), for the sending in of claims, shall be not less than one month
from the date on which the notice is given.
(4) Where the personal representative of a deceased person gives notice by
advertisement in accordance with subsection (1), the localities specified in
that subsection shall include each locality in which the deceased resided or
carried on business at any time during the year immediately preceding his
death.
(5) Notice by advertisement for the purposes of this section shall, so far as
2 months from the date on which the advertisement is published.
(2) Where the trustee is in doubt as to what advertisements should be published
under this section, he may apply to the Court for directions in that regard.
(3) Where the trustee has received (whether as a result of advertisements or
not) a claim that any person is a person to whom any advertisement made under
this section relates, or any notice that any person may claim to be such a
person, and the trustee is not satisfied that the claim is or would be valid,
the trustee may serve upon the claimant or the person of whom the trustee has
notice as aforesaid, a notice calling upon him, within a period of 3 months
from the date of service of the notice, to take legal proceedings to enforce
the claim, if he wishes to pursue it, and to prosecute the proceedings with all
due diligence; and advising him that, if he fails to do so, his claim may be
disregarded and application may be made to the Court without further notice for
an order authorising the distribution of the property.
(4) Nothing in subsection (3) makes it necessary for the trustee to serve a
notice therein mentioned on any person; and the Court may make an order under
this section, whether or not such a notice has been served on any person, if it
is satisfied that the information supplied to the trustee by that person or
otherwise in the possession of the trustee indicates that the person is not one
of the persons specified in the advertisements or is not likely to be one of
those persons.
(5) Upon proof by affidavit of the circumstances, and of the inquiries that
have been made, and of the results of the inquiries and advertisements, and of
the claims of which the trustee has received notice, and of the notices that
the trustee has given to claimants under subsection (3), and of the action (if
any) that the claimants have taken to enforce their claims, the Court may order
that the trustee be at liberty to distribute the property or part thereof,
subject to such conditions as the Court may impose -- 
(a) as if every person and every member of any class of person specified in the
order (being all or any of the persons specified in the advertisements) is not
in existence or never existed or has died before a date or event specified in
the order; and
(b) where as a consequence of the order it is not possible or practicable to
determine whether or not any condition or requirement affecting a beneficial
interest in the property or any part thereof has been complied with or
fulfilled, as if that condition or requirement had or had not been complied
with or fulfilled, as the Court may determine.
(6) In making any order under subsection (5), the Court may -- 
(a) disregard (without express reference thereto in the order) the claims of
any persons who do not appear to the Court to be, or likely to be, any of the
persons specified in the advertisements;
(b) disregard (without express reference thereto in the order) the claim of any
person to whom the trustee has given notice under subsection (3) and who has
failed to take legal proceedings to enforce the claim or to prosecute any such
proceedings with all due diligence;
(c) exclude from the operation of the order any person to whom the trustee has
not given notice under subsection (3) and who, in the opinion of the Court, may
be one of the persons specified in the advertisements, or any person whom the
Court considers should, for any reason, be excluded from the operation of the
order;
(d) provide that the order shall not be acted on for such period or except on
such conditions as may be specified in the order or that the effect of the
order shall during a period so specified be advertised in such manner and form
as may be specified in the order, or that the order be served upon such person
or persons as are specified therein; and in the event of the Court exercising
the jurisdiction conferred by this paragraph it may in the order direct that
the order shall be of no effect in respect of any person specified therein in
the event of that person instituting proceedings in the State to enforce his
claim and serving the proceedings upon the trustee within such period as is
specified in the order.
(7) The Court may make an order under this section notwithstanding that there
has not been strict compliance with any directions as to advertisements
previously given by the Court, or that an error has been made in any
advertisement (whether or not any directions have previously been given by the
Court) if the Court considers that the error would not be likely to have
prejudiced or misled the persons to whom the advertisement relates.
(8) Where the Court makes an order under this section that the trustee may
distribute any property or part thereof as if every person and every member of
any class of persons specified in the order (not being a person expressly
excluded from the operation of the order) is not in existence or never existed
or has died before a date or event specified in the order, and the trustee
distributes in accordance with the order, the trustee shall be exonerated from
any further liability to any such person or to any member of any such class;
but nothing in this section affects any remedy that any person may have against
any person other than the trustee, including any right that he may have to
follow the property and any money or property into which it is converted.
(9) The Court may make one or more orders under this section in respect of the
same property.
(10) Any order made under this section may direct how the costs of the order
and of advertising under or for the purposes of the order shall be borne.
(11) It shall not be necessary to serve notice of an application for an order
under this section upon any person, unless the Court otherwise orders.
(12) Nothing in this section affects the right of the trustee (if he so wishes)
to distribute under any other law or statutory provision or affects the
protection thereby afforded when he makes distribution pursuant to any such law
or provision.

67. Service of notices etc. under s. 30(1)(k), 64 and 66

(1) Any notice, application or order that is to be served in accordance with
section 64 or section 66, or in accordance with any order made pursuant to the
latter section, or any notice that is to be served under section 30(1)(k), may
be served -- 
(a) by delivering it to the person for whom it is intended or by sending it by
prepaid registered letter addressed to that person at his usual or last known
place of abode or business; or
(b) in such other manner as may be directed by an order of the Court.
(2) Where a notice is sent by post as provided by this section, it shall be
deemed to be served at the time at which the letter would have been delivered
in the ordinary course of post.

68. Trustee of more than one trust, protection as to notice

A trustee acting for the purposes of more than one trust shall not, in the
absence of fraud, be affected by notice of any instrument, matter, fact or
thing in relation to any particular trust, if he has obtained notice thereof
merely by reason of his acting or having acted for the purposes of another
trust.

69. Powers of attorney, protection for trustees relying on

(1) A trustee acting or paying money in good of faith in reliance on any power
of attorney and on a statutory declaration or other sufficient evidence that
the power of attorney had not been revoked shall not be liable for that act or
payment by reason of the fact that at the time of the act or payment the person
who gave the power of attorney was subject to any disability or bankrupt or
dead, or had done or suffered some act or thing to avoid the power, if this
fact was not known to the trustee at the time of his so acting or paying.
(2) Nothing in this section affects the right of any person entitled to money
paid by a trustee, in circumstances mentioned in subsection (1), against the
person to whom the payment is made; and the person so entitled shall have the
same remedy against the person to whom payment is made as he would have had
against the trustee.

70. Trustees liable for own defaults etc. only

A trustee shall be chargeable only for money and securities actually received
by him, notwithstanding his signing any receipt for the sake of conformity; and
shall be answerable and accountable only for his own acts, receipts, neglects
or defaults, and not for those of any other trustee, nor those of any bank,
broker or other person with whom any trust money or securities may be
deposited, nor for the insufficiency or deficiency of any securities, nor for
any other loss, unless the insufficiency, deficiency or loss occurs through his
own wilful default.

71. Trustees' expenses, reimbursement out of trust property

A trustee may reimburse himself for or pay or discharge out of the trust
property all expenses reasonably incurred in or about the execution of the
trusts or powers.

72. Chattels, bequest for life etc. or interest in, trustees' protection

(1) Where any chattels are, under the provisions of a will, bequeathed to any
person, including an infant, for life or for any limited interest, the trustee
may cause an inventory to be made of the chattels, of which inventory a copy
shall be signed by that person and retained by the trustee, and another copy
shall be delivered to that person.
(2) The trustee may, upon obtaining a signed copy of an inventory thereof,
deliver any chattels to a person such as is mentioned in subsection (1) on such
terms and conditions as the trustee thinks fit, and shall not thereafter be
bound to see to the repair or insurance of the chattels, and shall not be
subject to any liability whatsoever by reason of the loss or destruction of the
chattels or the neglect of that person to effect any necessary repairs or
insurance.
(4) Where chattels bequeathed to a person for life or some other limited
interest consist wholly of articles of household furniture, the trustee may
deliver those articles to that person and shall be entitled to the protection
provided by subsection (2) without any obligation to register an inventory
under subsection (3).

73. Chattels bequeathed to infant, dealing with

(1) A trustee may in his discretion deliver to an infant, or to the guardian or
any of the guardians of an infant, any chattels absolutely vested in the
infant, and the receipt of the infant or guardian shall be a complete discharge
to the trustee for any chattels so delivered.
(2) The powers conferred by this section are in addition to the powers
conferred by section 59 and, for the purposes of paragraph (a) of that section,
the value of the chattels delivered pursuant to this section shall not be taken
into account in any way.

74. Shares, trustees' liability for calls on after transfer of

A personal representative of a deceased person who was registered as the holder
of shares not fully paid up in any incorporated company may distribute the
assets of the estate of that deceased person as soon as the personal
representative has procured the registration of some other person as the holder
of the shares, without reserving any portion of the estate for the payment of
any calls made after the date of that registration, whether made by the company
or its directors or by its liquidators in a winding up, but nothing in this
section affects any right that the company or its liquidator may have to follow
the assets of the deceased person into the hands of any persons to or amongst
whom they have been transferred or distributed.

75. Breach of trust, Court may relieve trustee from personal liability for

If it appears to the Court that a trustee, whether appointed by the Court or
otherwise, is, or may be, personally liable for any breach of trust, whether
the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred before or after the
commencement of this Act, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought
fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the
directions of the Court in the matter in which he committed the breach, then
the Court may relieve him either wholly or partly from personal liability for
that breach.

76. Breach of trust, Court may order beneficiary to give indemnity for

(1) Where a trustee commits a breach of trust at the instigation or request or
with the consent in writing of a beneficiary, the Court may, if it thinks fit,
make such order as to the Court seems just for impounding all or any part of
the interest of the beneficiary in the trust estate by way of indemnity to the
trustee or persons claiming through him.
(2) This section applies to breaches of trust committed as well before as after
the commencement of this Act.

                    Part VII -- Further powers of the Court

                   Division 1 -- Appointment of new trustees

77. New trustees, Court may appoint

(1) The Court may, whenever it is expedient to appoint a new trustee or new
trustees, and it is inexpedient, difficult or impracticable so to do without
the assistance of the Court, make an order for the appointment of a new trustee
or new trustees, either in substitution for, or in addition to, any existing
trustee or trustees, or although there is no existing trustee.
(2) In particular, and without limiting the generality of the provisions of
subsection (1), the Court may make an order appointing a new trustee in
substitution for a trustee who -- 
(a) desires to be discharged; or
(b) has been held by the Court to have misconducted himself in the
administration of the trust; or
(c) is convicted of an indictable offence; or
(d) is a person of unsound mind; or
(e) is bankrupt; or
(f) is a corporation that has ceased to carry on business, or is in
liquidation, or has been dissolved.
(3) An order under this section, and any consequential vesting order or
conveyance, does not operate further or otherwise as a discharge to any
discharged, former or continuing trustee than an appointment of new trustees
under any power for that purpose contained in any instrument would have
operated.
(4) Nothing in this section confers power to appoint an executor or
administrator.
(5) Every trustee appointed by the Court has, as well before as after the trust
property becomes by law or by assurance or otherwise vested in him, the same
powers, authorities, and discretions, and may in all respects act, as if he had
been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument (if any) creating the
trust.

                          Division 2 -- Vesting orders

78. Vesting orders, when Court may make

(1) The Court may make an order, in this Act called a vesting order, that has
effect as provided in section 85.
(2) A vesting order may be made in any of the following cases, namely -- 
(a) where the Court appoints or has appointed a new trustee; or
(b) where a new trustee has been appointed out of Court under any statutory or
express power; or
(c) where a trustee retires or has retired; or
(d) where a trustee is under a disability; or
(e) where a trustee is out of the jurisdiction of the Court; or
(f) where a trustee cannot be found; or
(g) where a trustee, being a corporation, has ceased to carry on business or is
in liquidation or has been dissolved; or
(h) where a trustee neglects or refuses to convey any property, or to receive
the dividends or income of any property, or to sue for or recover any property
according to the direction of the person absolutely entitled to the same for
28 days next after a request in writing has been made to him by that person; or
(i) where it is uncertain who was the survivor of 2 or more trustees jointly
entitled to or possessed of any property; or
(j) where it is uncertain whether the last trustee known to have been entitled
to or possessed of any property is alive or dead; or
(k) where there is no personal representative of the last trustee who was
entitled to or possessed of any property or where it is uncertain who is the
personal representative of that trustee or where the personal representative of
that trustee cannot be found; or
(l) where any person neglects or refuses to convey any property, or to receive
the dividends or income of any property, or to sue for or recover any property
in accordance with the terms of an order of the Court; or
(m) where a deceased person was entitled to or possessed of any property and
his personal representative is under a disability; or
(n) where property is vested in a trustee and it appears to the Court to be
expedient to make a vesting order.
(3) Where the provisions of subsection (2) are applicable, they extend to a
trustee entitled to, or possessed of, any property either solely or jointly
with any other person and whether by way of mortgage or otherwise.

79. Vesting orders, terms of etc.

(1) A vesting order may vest the property in such person, in such manner and
for such estate or interest as the Court may direct, or may release or dispose
of any contingent right to such person as the Court may direct.
(2) The fact that a vesting order is founded or purports to be founded on an
allegation of the existence of any of the matters mentioned or referred to in
section 78 is conclusive evidence of the matter so alleged, in any Court, upon
any question as to the validity of the order.
(3) Nothing in this Act prevents the Court from directing a reconveyance or the
payment of costs occasioned by any vesting order if improperly obtained, or
from making a further vesting order.
(4) Where, by reason of the dissolution of a corporation either before or after
the commencement of this Act, a legal estate in any property has determined,
the Court may by order create a corresponding estate and vest it in the person
who would have been entitled to the estate that determined, had it remained a
subsisting estate.

80. Contingent rights of unborn persons, orders as to

Where any property is subject to a contingent right in an unborn person or
class of unborn persons who on coming into existence would become entitled to
or possessed of the property on any trust, the Court may make an order
releasing the property from the contingent right or may make an order vesting
in any person the estate or interest to, or of, which the unborn person or
class of unborn persons would, on coming into existence, be entitled or
possessed in the property.

81. Mortgagee under a disability, orders as to

under a disability the Court may make an order vesting or releasing or
disposing of the property in like manner as in the case of a trustee under like
disability.

82. Infant's beneficial interest, orders as to

Where an infant is beneficially entitled to any property, the Court may, where
it considers it necessary or desirable in the interest of the infant or of the
infant and some other person, make an order -- 
(a) appointing a person to sell and convey, lease, mortgage or charge the
property, or otherwise to exercise such of the powers as are conferred by or
under this Act on a trustee, as the Court may in the order specify; or
(b) in the case of stock or a thing in action, vesting in any person the right

is otherwise bound by the judgment or order, shall be deemed to be so entitled
or possessed as a trustee for the purposes of this Act, and the Court may, if
it thinks expedient, make an order vesting the land, or any part thereof, for

or in any other person.

of election or otherwise), the Court may declare -- 
(a) that any of the parties to the action are trustees of any interest in the
land, or any part thereof, within the meaning of this Act; or
(b) that the interests of unborn persons who might claim under any party to the
action, or under the will or voluntary settlement of any deceased person who
was, during his lifetime, a party to the contract or transaction concerning
which the judgment is given, are the interests of persons who, on coming into
existence, would be trustees within the meaning of this Act;
and thereupon the Court may make a vesting order relating to the rights of
those persons, born and unborn, as if they had been trustees.

85. Vesting orders, effect of

(1) In the case of a vesting order consequential on the appointment of a new
trustee or the retirement of a trustee, the vesting order has the same
effect -- 
(a) as if the persons (if any) who, before the appointment or retirement, were
the trustees had duly executed all proper conveyances of the property for such
estate or interest as the Court directs; or
(b) if there is no such person as is mentioned in paragraph (a), or no such
person of full capacity, as if such person had existed and been of full
capacity, and had duly executed all proper conveyances of the property for such
estate or interest as the Court directs.
(2) In every case, other than those hereinbefore in this section mentioned, the
vesting order has the same effect as if the trustee or other person or
description or class of persons to whose rights, or supposed rights, the
provisions of this Division respectively relate, had been an ascertained and
existing person of full capacity, and had executed a conveyance or release to
the effect intended by the order.
(3) In the case of land subject to the operation of the Transfer of Land
Act 1893, the land does not vest until the appropriate entries are made in
accordance with the provisions of that Act.

or otherwise; or
(b) any security that is transferable only in books kept by a corporation,
company or other body, or in manner directed by or under any Act, whether of
this State or otherwise,
a vesting order vests in the person named in the order the right to transfer or
call for a transfer of the property or security.
(5) In the case of any security or chose in action, the vesting order vests in
the person named in the order the right to receive the dividends or income
thereof, and to sue for or recover the chose in action.
(6) The person, in whom the right to transfer or call for the transfer of any
property or security is vested by an order of the Court under this Act, may
transfer the property or security to himself or to any other person in

associations and persons shall give effect to the transfer or comply with any
direction or request to transfer the property or security given or made in
accordance with the order.
(7) After notice in writing of an order made under this section, it shall not
be lawful for any bank, corporation, company, society, association or person to
transfer any property or security to which the order relates, or to pay any
dividends thereon, except in accordance with the order.

which the right to transfer any stock or thing in action vested under the
provisions of this Act is to be exercised.

Where a vesting order can be made under any of the foregoing provisions,
the Court may, if it is more convenient, appoint a person to convey the
property or release any right, and a conveyance or release by that person in
conformity with the order has the same effect as an order under the appropriate
provision.

88. Charities etc., vesting property in

The powers conferred by this Act as to vesting orders may be exercised for
vesting any property in any trustee of a charity or society over which the
Court would have jurisdiction upon action duly instituted, whether the

under its general or statutory jurisdiction.

retention, expenditure or other transaction is expedient in the management or
administration of any property vested in a trustee, or would be in the best
interests of the persons, or the majority of the persons, beneficially
interested under the trust, but it is inexpedient or difficult or impracticable
to effect the disposition or transaction without the assistance of the Court,
or it or they cannot be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that
purpose vested in the trustee by the trust instrument (if any) or by law, the
Court may by order confer upon the trustee, either generally or in any
particular instance, the necessary power for the purpose, on such terms, and
subject to such provisions and conditions (if any) as the Court may think fit,
and may direct in what manner any money authorised to be expended, and the
costs of any transaction, are to be paid or borne, and as to the incidence
thereof between capital and income.
(2) The Court may from time to time rescind or vary any order made under this
section, or may make any new or further order; but such a rescission or
variation of any order shall not affect any act or thing done in reliance on

contrary contained or expressed in the instrument creating the trust.

contingent, under the trusts who, by reason of infancy or other incapacity, is
incapable of assenting; or

or indirectly, to an interest under the trusts as being, at a future date or on
the happening of a future event, a person of any specified description or a

date had fallen or that event had happened at the date of the application to
the Court; or

managing or administering any of the property subject to the trusts.
(2) Except where the Court approves an arrangement on behalf of a person
referred to in subsection (1)(d), the Court shall not approve an arrangement on
behalf of any person if the arrangement is to his detriment; and, in

trustee by which he will be aggrieved, may apply to the Court to review the
act, omission or decision, or to give directions in respect of the apprehended
act, omission or decision; and the Court may require the trustee to appear

found, the Court may hear and determine the proceedings and give judgment
therein against that person, in his character of a trustee, as if he had been
duly served or had entered an appearance in the action, and had also appeared
by his counsel or solicitor at the hearing, but (except as provided
in subsection (2)) without prejudice to any interest he may have in the matters
in question in the proceedings in any other character.
(2) Where any party to any proceedings relating to a trust, or where any person

created did not contain any express power to give such an authority.
