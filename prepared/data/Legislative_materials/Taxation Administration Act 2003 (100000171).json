(2) When the State Administrative Tribunal is dealing with a matter brought before it under this Act that relates to an assessment or decision under or for the purposes of the Duties Act 2008, the Pay-roll Tax Assessment Act 2002, or the Stamp Act 1921, the State Administrative Tribunal is to be constituted by its President, or a Deputy President of it, sitting alone unless subsection (2aa) applies. (2aa) A proceeding brought before the State Administrative Tribunal under this Act is included in the operation of section 93 of the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 if it is -- (a) a proceeding of a kind described in paragraph (a) of the definition of minor proceeding in subsection (1) of that section or included by regulations referred to in paragraph (b) of that definition; or (b) a proceeding for the review of a directly reviewable decision; or (c) a proceeding for the review of a decision of the Commissioner under section 47 in connection with extending time for payment of tax or approving payment of tax in instalments, but the effect of a no appeals election made under that section in relation to the proceeding is modified as described in subsection (2ab). (2ab) The no appeals election does not prevent the Commissioner from making an appeal under the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 Part 5, without leave, against the decision in the proceeding on a question of law if the Minister -- (a) certifies in writing that the question is significant for the protection of the revenue of the State; and (b) agrees to indemnify each other party to the proceeding in respect of any cost involved in the appeal, but a decision made by the Supreme Court in dealing with the appeal does not affect the decision in the proceeding from which the appeal arose and the matter cannot be sent back to the State Administrative Tribunal for reconsideration. (2a) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) -- (a) a person appointed as a supplementary President of the State Administrative Tribunal under section 139 of the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 is not to be regarded as its President unless the person is a judge, acting judge or auxiliary judge of the Supreme Court; and (b) a person appointed as a supplementary Deputy President of the State Administrative Tribunal under section 141 of the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 is not to be regarded as a Deputy President of it unless the person is a judge, acting judge or auxiliary judge of the District Court. (2b) Subsections (1) and (2) apply to the constitution of the State Administrative Tribunal at every stage of a proceeding before it, including a directions hearing or other hearing of a procedural nature before the Tribunal. (3) If the final reassessment of the taxpayer's liability indicates that tax has been overpaid, the taxpayer is entitled to a refund or credit of the overpaid amount and the following amounts -- (a) any amount paid by the taxpayer for the lodging of a memorial under section 76, 77 or 77A, if the Commissioner has lodged a withdrawal of the memorial as a result of the final reassessment; (b) interest during the reassessment period, calculated at the prescribed rate, on the amount to be refunded or credited, including any amount referred to in paragraph (a). (4A) In subsection (3)(b) -- reassessment period, in relation to the payment of interest on an amount, means the period -- (a) beginning on whichever is the later of -- (i) the date on which the overpaid amount was paid by the taxpayer; or (ii) the date on which the assessment or decision the subject of the Commissioner's decision to which the review proceedings relate, was made; and (b) ending on the date, on or after the date the Commissioner made the final reassessment, on which the Commissioner approves the refunding or crediting of the amount.
