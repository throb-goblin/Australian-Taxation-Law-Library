Section 26A Application of this Subdivision
  This Subdivision applies to assessments for the 1997-98 income year
or a later income year.
Section 26B Transfer of tax loss from transferring corporation to receiving
corporation
  In addition to its effect apart from this section, the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1997 also has the effect it would have if Subdivision
Section 170-A (which is about transferring tax losses within wholly-owned
company groups) of that Act were replaced by Subdivision 170-A (which
is a modified version of the rules in that Subdivision) in Schedule 1
to this Act.
Section 26C Deduction for tax loss-easing of restrictions on transferring
corporation
  If:
  (a) this Act applies to one or more transfers by the transferring
corporation to the receiving corporation; and
  (b) the transferring corporation is taken (otherwise than because of
a transfer of a tax loss under section 80G of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936 or Subdivision 170-A of the Income Tax Assessment
Act 1997) to have incurred a tax loss for a year of income (the loss
year); and
  (c) the loss year is the income year in which section 26 of this Act
commenced or an earlier income year; and
  (d) Subdivision 165-A or 175-A, or both, of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1997 prevent the transferring corporation from
deducting an amount of that tax loss for an income year (the deduction
year); and
  (e) the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the
deduction year, derive income from:
    (i) a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or
    (ii) a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the
course of its business operations;
before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred;
neither Subdivision 165-A nor 175-A of that Act prevents the
transferring corporation from deducting that amount.
Note:  Subdivision 165-A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is
about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can
deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year.
  Subdivision 175-A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is about the
Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits
through its unused tax losses.

     Schedule 1-Tax losses and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997
     Subdivision 170-A-Transfer of tax losses from a transferring
              corporation to a receiving corporation
Guide to Subdivision 170-A
Section 170-1 What this Subdivision is about
  A transferring corporation (within the meaning of the Financial
Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993) can
transfer a tax loss to a receiving corporation (within the meaning of
that Act) so that the receiving corporation can deduct it. The
corporations must be related in such a way that that Act would apply
to a transfer of assets from the transferring corporation to the
receiving corporation.

Section 170-5 Basic principles for transferring tax losses
  (1) A transferring corporation (within the meaning of the Financial
Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993) can
transfer a tax loss to a receiving corporation (within the meaning of
that Act) so that the receiving corporation can deduct it.
  (2) The corporations must be related in such a way that that Act
would apply to a transfer of assets from the transferring corporation
to the receiving corporation.
  (3) The receiving corporation need not have enough assessable income
to offset the transferred tax loss.
  (4) The tax loss is transferred by an agreement between the 2
corporations.
              Effect of transferring a tax loss
Section 170-10 When a corporation can transfer a tax loss
  (1) A transferring corporation within the meaning of the Financial
Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 (the loss
company) can transfer an amount of its *tax loss for an income year of
the loss company (the loss year) to a receiving corporation within the
meaning of that Act (the income company) if the conditions in this
Subdivision are met.
  (2) The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the *tax
loss.
Note:  A PDF cannot transfer a tax loss, except one for a period
before it became a PDF: see section 195-10.
  (3) However, the *loss company cannot transfer so much of the *tax
loss as the loss company has deducted, or can deduct, for an income
year before the one in which the amount is transferred.
Section 170-15 Income company is taken to have incurred transferred loss
  (1) If an amount of a *tax loss is transferred, the *amount is taken
to be a tax loss incurred by the *income company in the *loss year.
  (2) However, if the *loss year is the same as the income year of the
*income company for which the amount is transferred (the transfer
year), the *income company is taken to have incurred the *tax loss in
the income year before the loss year.
Note:  This rule is needed because Division 36 allows a tax loss to be
deducted only if it was incurred in an earlier income year.
Section 170-20 Who can deduct transferred loss
  (1) If an amount of a *tax loss is transferred, the *income company
can deduct the amount in accordance with section 36-15 (which is about
how to deduct a tax loss), but only if Subdivision 165-A (as modified
by section 170-23) and Subdivision 175-A do not prevent it from doing
so.
Note:  Subdivision 165-A is about the conditions that a company needs
to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income
year.
  Subdivision 175-A is about the Commissioner preventing a company
from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax losses.
  (2) The *loss company can no longer deduct the transferred amount
and is taken not to have incurred the *tax loss to the extent of that
amount.
Section 170-23 When income company must maintain same owners and control
  (1) Ordinarily, Subdivision 165-A prevents a company from deducting
for an income year (the deduction year) a tax loss if there has been a
change in the ownership or control of the company between the loss
year and the deduction year.
Note:  Subdivision 165-A is about the conditions that a company needs
to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income
year.
  (2) However, subsection (3) modifies that Subdivision so that the
*income company is prevented from deducting for the deduction year a
transferred amount of a *tax loss only if there has been a change in
ownership or control in the income company between the transfer year
and the deduction year.
  (3) That Subdivision applies to the transferred amount as if all
references to "*loss year" in that Subdivision were references to
"*transfer year".
Section 170-25 Tax treatment of payment for transferred tax loss
  (1) A payment received for an amount of a *tax loss is neither
assessable income nor exempt income of the *loss company.
  (2) The *income company cannot deduct a payment it makes for an
amount of a *tax loss.
                     Conditions for transfer
Section 170-28 Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities)
Act 1993 must apply to asset transfer from loss company to income
company
  If it were assumed that:
  (a) an asset (within the meaning of the Financial Corporations
(Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993) had been transferred by
the *loss company to the *income company on the last day of a
particular income year of the *loss company (the notional transfer
year); and
  (b) the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were
satisfied in relation to that transfer;
then it must be the case that that Act would have applied to that
transfer.
Section 170-32 The loss year
  The *loss year must be either:
  (a) the income year in which the Financial Corporations (Transfer of
Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 commenced; or
  (b) an earlier income year.
Section 170-33 The transfer year
  (1) The *transfer year must either:
  (a) end at the end of the *notional transfer year; or
  (b) correspond to the income year of the *loss company that next
follows the *notional transfer year.
  (2) Also, the *transfer year must be one of the 5 income years after
the  income year in which the Financial Corporations (Transfer of
Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 commenced.
Section 170-35 The loss company
  If the *loss year and the *transfer year are the same, it must be
the case that the *loss company was not required to calculate the *tax
loss under section 165-70 or 175-35.
Section 170-50 Transfer by written agreement
  (1) The transfer must be made by a written agreement between the
*loss company and the *income company.
  (2) The agreement must:
  (a) specify the *transfer year (which may be earlier than the income
year in which the agreement is made); and
  (b) specify the amount of the *tax loss being transferred; and
  (c) be signed by the public officer of each company; and
  (d) be made on or before the day of lodgment of the *income
company's *income tax return for the *transfer year, or within such
further time as the Commissioner allows.
Note:  The agreement will usually be made in the next income year
after the one in which the tax loss is transferred.
Section 170-55 Losses must be transferred in order they are incurred
  (1) If the *loss company has 2 or more *tax losses (other than *film
losses) that it can transfer in the *transfer year, it can transfer
them only in the order in which it incurred them.
  (2) If the *loss company has 2 or more *film losses that it can
transfer in the *transfer year, it can transfer them only in the order
in which it incurred them.
Section 170-60 Income company cannot transfer transferred tax loss
  The *income company cannot transfer an amount of a *tax loss
transferred to it, or any part of the amount.
    Effect of agreement to transfer more than can be transferred
Section 170-65 Agreement transfers as much as can be transferred
  (1) If the amount specified in an agreement exceeds the maximum
amount that the *loss company can transfer to the *income company in
the *transfer year, only that maximum amount is taken to have been
transferred.
  (2) One reason why an agreement might specify more than can be
transferred is that an assessment has been amended since the
agreement.
Section 170-70 Amendment of assessments
  The Commissioner may amend an assessment to disallow a deduction for
a transferred amount of a *tax loss:
  (a) if the agreement to transfer the tax loss is ineffective because
the *loss company did not actually incur the loss; or
  (b) to the extent that section 170-65 reduces the transferred amount
of a tax loss because the loss company did not actually incur some of
it.
  The Commissioner may do so despite section 170 (Amendment of
assessments) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.
