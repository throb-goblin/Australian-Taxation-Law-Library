occupancy from a shareholder in the company; and

             (d)         the scheme of company ownership and shareholder occupation of the
dwellings was established before 22 February 1968,

then each dwelling will be taken to be a separate parcel of land and,
despite the definition of "owner" in subsection (1), the
shareholder who is entitled to occupy the dwelling (and not the company) will be
taken to be the legal owner of the land on which the dwelling is
situated.

         (3)         If--

             (a)         land is held under a tenancy in common; and

             (b)         the land is divided into separate portions and the owner of each
undivided share in the land is entitled under a lease registered over the title
to the land to occupy a particular portion of the land,

then the land will not be treated as a single parcel of land in multiple
ownership but rather each owner of an undivided share in the land will be
regarded as the owner of the portion of the land that the owner is entitled to
occupy under the lease.

resident's interest in prescribed land exceeds 5% but is less
than 50%, subsection (6) will apply in relation to the interest (a
"prescribed interest") if the Commissioner forms the opinion that
the purpose, or 1 of the purposes, for the creation of the resident's
interest was to reduce the amount of land tax payable in respect of the land, or
any other piece of land.

         (4)         If the Commissioner forms the opinion for the purposes of
subsection (3) that the purpose, or 1 of the purposes, for the
creation of the resident's interest was to reduce the amount of land tax payable
in respect of land--

             (a)         subsection (6) will be taken to have applied in relation to the
interest from the date on which the interest was created; and

             (b)         if--

                   (i)         the land was wholly or partially exempted from land tax for a
particular financial year; and

                   (ii)         the Commissioner is satisfied, on the basis of having formed the
opinion, that there were not, in respect of that financial year, proper grounds
for exempting the land from land tax,

the Commissioner may withdraw the exemption in respect of that financial
year.

         (5)         For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), the
Commissioner may have regard to--

             (a)         the nature of any relationships between the owners of the land, or

and

             (b)         the lack of consideration, or the amount, value or source of the
consideration, provided in association with the creation of the interest;

or operation of the interest, including the legal and economic obligations of
the parties and the economic and commercial substance of any such transaction;
and

operation of the interest was entered into or carried out; and

             (e)         any other matter the Commissioner considers relevant.

         (6)         If this
subsection applies in relation to a prescribed interest under this section, the
resident holding the prescribed interest is taken not to be--

             (a)         an owner of land for the purposes of section 5(10)(a)
to (bb) (inclusive) to the extent of the prescribed interest; or

             (b)         in a case in which subsection (9)(a)(ii) applies in relation to a
beneficiary, a beneficiary under a relevant trust for the purposes of this
Act.

         (7)         If the Commissioner decides to reject an application of an owner of
land under subsection (2), the Commissioner must give notice of the
decision to the owner--

             (a)         stating the decision; and

             (b)         stating the grounds on which the decision is based.

         (8)         If the Commissioner forms an opinion under subsection (3) so as

give notice of the operation of subsection (6) to each owner of the
land--

             (a)         stating the fact that the opinion has been formed, and setting out its
effect under this section; and

             (b)         stating the grounds on which the opinion is based.

         (9)         For the
purposes of this section--

             (a)         a reference to
an interest in land is a reference--

                   (i)         to an estate, interest or other circumstance that makes a person an
owner of land under this Act (but does not include an interest consisting only
of a right of occupation); or

                   (ii)         to an interest
that a person has in land that arises by virtue of a trust, either as trustee or
beneficiary, other than--

                         (A)         a trust arising because of a contract to purchase or acquire an estate
or interest in the land; or

                         (B)         an interest arising in any other circumstances prescribed by the
regulations; and

             (b)         an interest may be or become subject to the operation of this section
no matter when it was created, including in a case where the interest was
created before the commencement of this section.

of the financial year, of any other land in respect of which the applicant has
had the benefit of a relevant concession for the financial year;

                   (iv)         unless the Commissioner allows otherwise in a particular case, no

                   (ii)         a proportion of the land tax that would be payable on the land for
the financial year concerned if the taxpayer owned only that land, being the
proportion that the number of days from the date of settlement to the end of
that financial year bears to 365,

whichever is the lesser.

             (a)         has made a determination that land tax, or an amount representing land
tax, in respect of land for a financial year be waived or refunded under this
section; and

             (b)         subsequently determines that proper grounds for the determination did
not exist,

the Commissioner may revoke the earlier determination and, in that event,
the amount waived or refunded becomes payable as land tax in respect of the land
for the financial year by the person who had the benefit of the waiver or
refund.

         (6a)         A person is not eligible for a waiver or refund of land tax under
this section if the relevant land becomes the person's principal place of

or both.

         (5)         If the Commissioner is satisfied that only part of a parcel of land is

percentage change in site values for a particular financial year will be
determined by the Valuer-General after the application of the following
principles:

             (a)         in determining
the average percentage change in site values for the financial year, the
Valuer-General will take into account changes in the site value of land
according to valuations applying under the Valuation of Land
Act 1971 with respect to a period of 12 months expiring on a date
to be determined by the Valuer-General, being a date that falls on or before
30 June in the financial year immediately preceding the relevant financial
year;

             (b)         the average
percentage change in site values must take into account changes in the site
value of residential land and changes in the site value of other land (as
identified by the Valuer-General), with the averaging being undertaken in
accordance with a method determined to be appropriate by the Valuer-General
after taking into account the provisions of this Act and the Valuation of
Land Act 1971;

             (c)         for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b)--

                   (i)         vacant land zoned for residential purposes will be treated as
residential land and vacant land zoned for any other purpose (other than primary
production) will be treated as other land; and

                   (ii)         land used for primary production must be excluded.

         (4a)         If, after applying subsection (4) to determine the Index value
for the 2020/2021 financial year under subsection (2a), the result
would be an Index value for that year that would be less than or equal to the
Index value that applied for the 2019/2020 financial year or a preceding
financial year, the adjusted thresholds for the 2020/2021 financial year
will be taken to be the thresholds that applied for the 2019/2020 financial
year.

         (5)         If, after applying subsection (4) to determine the Index value
for a particular financial year ("year x") under
subsection (3) or (3b), the result would be an Index value for
year x that would be less than or equal to an Index value that has applied
for--

             (a)         if the Index value is determined under
subsection (3)--the 2020/2021 financial year or a subsequent
financial year occurring before year x; or

             (b)         if the Index value is determined under
subsection (3b)--the 2022/2023 financial year or a subsequent
financial year occurring before year x,

the thresholds for year x will remain unchanged (so as to be equal to
the year x-1 amounts).

         (6)         On or before
30 June in each year (commencing in 2011), the Valuer-General must publish
by notice in the Gazette--

             (a)         the average percentage change in site values for the ensuing financial
year ("year x"); and

             (b)         the Index value for the ensuing financial year ("year
x).

         (7)         The
Commissioner must, on or after the publication of a notice under
subsection (6) with respect to a financial year (the ensuing financial year
under subsection (6)), by notice in the Gazette, publish the thresholds
that will apply with respect to that financial year (being a notice that may be
published before, on or after 1 July in that financial year).

         (8)         For the purposes of subsection (7), the thresholds will be
rounded to the nearest $1 000 (with an amount of $500 rounded
up).

         (9)         A notice under subsection (7) will have effect according to its
terms (and be conclusive in all respects for the purposes of this
section).

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 8B
8B--Aggregation
of land

         (1)         Except as otherwise provided by this Act, land tax is calculated on
the basis of the aggregate taxable value of all land owned by the
taxpayer.

         (2)         If a taxpayer is liable to pay land tax in respect of land included in
more than 1 land tax assessment, the land tax is (subject to any additional levy
that affects portion only of that land) apportioned to and chargeable on the
land included in the various assessments in the proportions that the taxable
value of the land included in each separate assessment bears to the aggregate
taxable value of all the land.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 9
9--Land
tax where more than 1 owner of land

         (1)         This section applies where 2 or more persons are the owners of
the same land (whether in the same or in different capacities).

         (2)         If 2 or more
persons are owners of the same land but not all in the same capacity, the
Commissioner may treat all who are owners of the land in a particular capacity
(to be determined by the Commissioner) as--

             (a)         the sole owner or owners of the land; and

             (b)         the sole taxpayer or taxpayers for the land.

         (3)         If the Commissioner treats a person or persons as the sole owner or
owners of land under subsection (2), the provisions of this Act under which
the value of land is aggregated, for the purpose of the assessment of tax, with
the value of other land will apply as if that person or those persons were the
sole owner or owners of the land.

         (4)         Subject to
subsection (5), the owners of the land are to be jointly assessed for land
tax on the land as if it were owned by a single person, without regard
to--

             (a)         the separate interest of each owner; or

             (b)         any other land owned by any owner (either alone or with someone
else).

         (5)         Subsection (4)
does not affect the operation of any provisions of this Act under which the
value of land is aggregated, for the purpose of the assessment of tax, with the
value of other land.

         (6)         In addition,
each owner of the land is to be separately assessed for land tax
on--

             (a)         the owner's
individual interest in the land (as if the owner were the owner of a part of the
land in proportion to that interest); and

             (b)         any other land owned by the owner alone; and

             (c)         the owner's individual interest in any other land.

         (7)         Subsection (6) does not apply to land subject to an excluded
trust.

         (8)         Subject to
subsection (9), there is to be deducted from the land tax assessed for an
owner under subsection (6) an amount (if any) necessary to avoid double
taxation, being the amount determined by the formula:

Where--

"A" is the proportion of the owner's individual interest in the
land to the total interests in that land

"B" is the total amount of land tax assessed on the land under
subsection (4).

Note--

The deduction is applied to the total land tax assessed for the owner and
not just to the land tax assessed for this land.

         (9)         If a deduction
under subsection (8) would result in a negative amount--

             (a)         zero is to be substituted for that amount; and

             (b)         the amount of the difference between that amount and zero will not be
credited to any liability for land tax under this Act.

         (10)         If an owner of
land is a trustee of a trust to which the land is subject, no regard is to be
had to the existence of the trust in relation to the joint assessment of the
owners of the land as referred to in subsection (4), but regard is to be
had to the existence of the trust in relation to the separate assessment of the
owners as referred to in subsection (6).

         (11)         This section applies subject to the operation of
section 5AA.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 9A
9A--Land
under Help to Buy arrangement

         (1)         For the purposes of assessing land tax on land purchased under a Help
to Buy arrangement, an interest the Commonwealth or Housing Australia has in the
land is to be disregarded.

         (2)         In this section--

"Help to Buy arrangement" has the same meaning as in the
Help to Buy Act 2024 of the Commonwealth;

"Housing Australia" has the same meaning as in the Housing
Australia Act 2018 of the Commonwealth.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 10
10--Assessment
of tax against land divided by community or strata plan

         (1)         If land is divided by a primary, secondary or tertiary plan of
community division under the Community Titles
Act 1996--

             (a)         in the case of the division of land by a primary plan--land tax
will be assessed against the primary lots that are not divided by a secondary
plan and against a development lot or lots (if any); and

             (b)         in the case of the division of land by a secondary plan--land tax
will be assessed against the secondary lots that are not divided by a tertiary
plan and against the development lot or lots (if any); and

             (c)         in the case of the division of land by a tertiary plan--land tax
will be assessed against the tertiary lots and a development lot or lots (if
any).

         (2)         If land is divided by a primary, secondary or tertiary plan of
community division under the Community Titles
Act 1996--

             (a)         in the case of
the division of land by a primary plan--where the use of the common
property or part of it is, in the opinion of the Valuer-General, reasonably
incidental to the use of 1 or more of the primary lots, land tax will
not be levied against the common property, or that part of it, but the interest
in the common property, or that part of it, that attaches to each primary lot
will be regarded for the purposes of valuation as part of the lot; and

             (b)         in the case of
the division of land by a secondary plan--where the use of the common
property or part of it is, in the opinion of the Valuer-General, reasonably
incidental to the use of 1 or more of the secondary lots, land tax
will not be levied against the common property, or that part of it, but the
interest in the common property, or that part of it, (and in the common property
of the primary scheme referred to in paragraph (a) (if any)) that attaches
to each secondary lot will be regarded for the purposes of valuation as part of
the lot; and

             (c)         in the case of the division of land by a tertiary plan--where the
use of the common property or part of it is, in the opinion of the
Valuer-General, reasonably incidental to the use of 1 or more of the
tertiary lots, land tax will not be levied against the common property, or that
part of it, but the interest in the common property, or that part of it, (and in
the common property of the primary and secondary schemes referred to in
paragraphs (a) and (b) (if any)) that attaches to each tertiary lot
will be regarded for the purposes of valuation as part of the lot.

         (3)         If land is divided by a primary, secondary or tertiary plan of
community division under the Community Titles Act 1996 and the use
of the common property or any part of it is not, in the opinion of the
Valuer-General, reasonably incidental to the use of any of the community lots,
land tax will be levied against the common property or that part of it and the
relevant community corporation is liable for the tax as though it were the owner
of the common property.

         (4)         If land is divided by a strata plan under the Strata Titles
Act 1988, land tax will be assessed against the strata units but not
against the common property.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 11
11--Separate
assessment of trust land

Where a person is the owner of land as trustee of a trust (other than a
trust arising because of a contract to purchase or acquire an estate or interest
in the land), the trustee is to be assessed for land tax on the whole of the
land subject to the trust as if the land were the only land owned by the
trustee.

Note--

This means that where an interest in land is held on trust (other than a
trust arising because of a contract to purchase or acquire an estate or interest
in the land) and the trustee is the taxpayer for the land, the taxable value of
the interest in land--

         *          will be aggregated with the taxable value of other land subject to
the same trust; but

         *          will not be aggregated with the taxable value of other land owned
by the same taxpayer and not subject to the same trust.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 12
12--Land
tax for fixed trust if beneficial interests notified to
Commissioner

         (1)         A trustee of a
fixed trust to which land is subject may lodge with the Commissioner a written
notice of the beneficial interests in the land.

         (2)         A notice must be in the form, and contain the information, determined
by the Commissioner.

         (3)         A notice takes effect, at the option of the trustee (which must be
specified in the notice), for the tax year in which the notice is lodged or for
the following year, and remains in force until it is withdrawn by the
trustee.

         (4)         Despite subsection (1), if a trustee withdraws a notice that is
in force under this section in respect of a fixed trust, the trustee cannot
lodge another notice under this section in respect of that fixed
trust.

Note--

For changes to beneficial interests see section 13D(6)

         (5)         If a notice is
in force under this section for a fixed trust, the following provisions
apply:

             (a)         a beneficiary
of the trust is deemed, for the purposes of this Act (other than a residential
land exemption), to be the owner (but not to the exclusion of the trustee) of
land subject to the trust that bears the same proportion to the whole of the
land subject to the trust as the beneficiary's beneficial interest in land
subject to the trust bears to the total beneficial interests in land subject to
the trust, and is liable for land tax on that land accordingly, together with
any other land owned by the beneficiary, assessed in accordance with
section 8A(1) at the rates set out in Schedule 1
Part 2;

             (b)         however, if any
land--

                   (i)         constitutes the principal place of residence for all of the
beneficiaries of the trust; and

                   (ii)         would, if it were owned by a natural person, be wholly or partially
exempted from land tax under a residential land exemption,

the beneficiaries are deemed to be the owners of the land for the purposes
of the residential land exemptions;

             (c)         the trustee is
liable for land tax on the whole of the land subject to the trust assessed, in
accordance with section 8A(1) at the rates set out in Schedule 1
Part 2, as if the land were the only land owned by the trustee.

Note--

If the beneficiaries are exempt from land tax under paragraph (b), the
trustee will also be exempt because the effect of the residential land
exemptions is to render the land exempt from land tax.

         (6)         Subject to
subsection (7), there is to be deducted from the land tax payable by a
beneficiary under subsection (5)(a) an amount (if any) necessary to avoid
double taxation, being the amount determined by the formula:

Where--

"A" is the proportion of the beneficiary's beneficial interest
in the land subject to the trust to the total beneficial interests in land
subject to the trust

"B" is the total amount of land tax assessed on the trustee
under subsection (5)(c).

Note--

The deduction is applied to the total land tax assessed for the beneficiary
and not just to the land tax assessed for the land subject to the
trust.

         (7)         If a deduction
under subsection (6) would result in a negative amount--

             (a)         zero is to be substituted for that amount; and

             (b)         the amount of the difference between that amount and zero will not be
credited to any liability for land tax under this Act.

         (8)         Subsection (5)(a) does not apply to a beneficiary who holds a
beneficial interest as trustee of another trust.

Note--

Section 13B(1)(a) deems such a person to be the owner of
land.

         (9)         For the purposes of this section, a reference to a fixed trust does
not include a public unit trust scheme.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 13
13--Land
tax for unit trust scheme if unitholdings notified to
Commissioner

         (1)         A trustee of a
unit trust scheme to which land is subject may lodge with the Commissioner a
written notice of the unitholdings in the scheme.

         (2)         A notice must be in the form, and contain the information, determined
by the Commissioner.

         (3)         A notice takes effect, at the option of the trustee (which must be
specified in the notice), for the tax year in which the notice is lodged or for
the following year, and remains in force until it is withdrawn by the
trustee.

         (4)         Despite subsection (1), if a trustee withdraws a notice that is
in force under this section in respect of a unit trust scheme, the trustee
cannot lodge another notice under this section in respect of that unit trust
scheme.

Note--

For changes to unitholdings see section 13D(7).

         (5)         If a notice is
in force under this section for a unit trust scheme, the following provisions
apply:

             (a)         a unitholder in
the scheme is deemed, for the purposes of this Act (other than a residential
land exemption) to be the owner (but not to the exclusion of the trustee) of
land subject to the scheme that bears the same proportion to the whole of the
land subject to the scheme as the unitholder's unitholding in the scheme bears
to the total unitholdings in the scheme, and is liable for land tax on that land
accordingly, together with any other land owned by the unitholder, assessed in
accordance with section 8A(1) at the rates set out in Schedule 1
Part 2;

             (b)         however, if any
land--

                   (i)         constitutes the principal place of residence for all of the
unitholders in the scheme; and

                   (ii)         would, if it were owned by a natural person, be wholly or partially
exempted from land tax under a residential land exemption,

the unitholders are deemed to be the owners of the land for the purposes of
the residential land exemptions;

             (c)         the trustee is
liable for land tax on the whole of the land subject to the trust assessed, in
accordance with section 8A(1) at the rates set out in Schedule 1
Part 2, as if the land were the only land owned by the trustee.

Note--

If the unitholders are exempt from land tax under paragraph (b), the
trustee will also be exempt because the effect of the residential land
exemptions is to render the land exempt from land tax.

         (6)         Subject to
subsection (7), there is to be deducted from the land tax payable by a
unitholder under subsection (5)(a) an amount (if any) necessary to avoid
double taxation, being the amount determined by the formula:

Where--

"A" is the proportion of the unitholder's unitholding in the
scheme to the total unitholdings in the scheme

"B" is the total amount of land tax assessed on the trustee
under subsection (5)(c).

Note--

The deduction is applied to the total land tax assessed for the unitholder
and not just to the land tax assessed for the land subject to the unit trust
scheme.

         (7)         If a deduction
under subsection (6) would result in a negative amount--

             (a)         zero is to be substituted for that amount; and

             (b)         the amount of the difference between that amount and zero will not be
credited to any liability for land tax under this Act.

         (8)         Subsection (5)(a) does not apply to a unitholder who holds units
as trustee of another trust.

Note--

Section 13B(1)(b) deems such a person to be the owner of
land.

         (9)         For the purposes of this section, a reference to a unit trust scheme
does not include a public unit trust scheme.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 13A
13A--Land
tax for discretionary trust if beneficiary notified to
Commissioner

         (1)         A trustee of a
discretionary trust to which land is subject may, not later than 31 December
2021, lodge with the Commissioner a written notice
specifying 1 beneficiary of the trust who, subject to
subsections (13) and (14), is to be taken to be the designated
beneficiary of the trust for the purposes of this section.

         (2)         For the avoidance of doubt, a trust may only have 1 person who is
the designated beneficiary for the purposes of this section (and may only
substitute the designated beneficiary by notice lodged under
subsection (5)).

         (3)         A notice takes effect, at the option of the trustee (which must be
specified in the notice), for the tax year in which the notice is lodged or for
the previous or following year, and remains in force until it is withdrawn by
the trustee or until the designated beneficiary notifies the Commissioner, in
writing, that they no longer consent to being the designated beneficiary (in
which case the notice is deemed to have been withdrawn by the
trustee).

         (4)         A designated
beneficiary may be substituted--

             (a)         if the designated beneficiary dies or becomes incapacitated;
or

             (b)         if the Commissioner is satisfied that, because of a marriage, de facto
relationship or domestic relationship that has broken down irretrievably, the
designated beneficiary will no longer be a beneficiary of the trust;
or

             (c)         in circumstances prescribed by the regulations.

         (5)         If the
designated beneficiary may be substituted in accordance with
subsection (4), a trustee of the trust may lodge with the Commissioner a
written notice--

             (a)         advising the Commissioner of the grounds on which the designated
beneficiary may be substituted; and

             (b)         specifying the name of another beneficiary of the trust who is to be
taken to be the designated beneficiary for the purposes of this section in place
of the beneficiary named in the original notice.

         (6)         If a written notice is lodged under
subsection (5)--

             (a)         subject to subsection (13), the beneficiary of the trust
specified in the notice becomes the designated beneficiary of the trust;
and

             (b)         the notice under subsection (1) is taken to have been varied
accordingly.

         (7)         A notice under this section must be in the form, and contain the
information, determined by the Commissioner.

         (8)         Despite subsection (1), if a trustee withdraws a notice that is
in force under this section in respect of a discretionary trust, the trustee
cannot lodge another notice under this section in respect of that discretionary
trust.

         (9)         If a notice is
in force under this section for a discretionary trust, the following provisions
apply:

             (a)         the designated
beneficiary of the trust is deemed, for the purposes of this Act (other than a
residential land exemption), to be the owner (but not to the exclusion of the
trustee) of land that was subject to the trust at the prescribed time
("pre-existing trust land") and is liable for land tax on that land
accordingly, together with any other land owned by the beneficiary, assessed in
accordance with section 8A(1) at the rates set out in Schedule 1
Part 2;

             (b)         however, if any
pre-existing trust land--

                   (i)         constitutes the principal place of residence of the designated
beneficiary; and

                   (ii)         would, if it were owned by a natural person, be wholly or partially
exempted from land tax under a residential land exemption,

the designated beneficiary is deemed to be the owner of the land for the
purposes of the residential land exemptions;

             (c)         the trustee for
the trust is to be assessed for land tax on the whole of the land subject to the
trust as if the land were the only land owned by the trustee--

                   (i)         in the case of pre-existing trust land--in accordance with
section 8A(1) at the rates set out in Schedule 1 Part 2;
or

                   (ii)         in the case of land that became subject to the trust after the
prescribed time ("subsequent trust land")--in accordance with
section 8A(1a) at the rates set out in Schedule 1 Part 3;
or

                   (iii)         in the case where land subject to the trust consists of both
pre-existing trust land and subsequent trust land--in accordance with the
following formula:

Where--

"L" is the land tax assessed for the trustee

"R""1" is the
applicable rate of land tax set out in Schedule 1 Part 2

"R""2" is the
applicable rate of land tax set out in Schedule 1 Part 3

"T" is the total taxable value of all taxable land subject to
the trust

"A" is the total taxable value of the pre-existing trust land
subject to the trust

"B" is the total taxable value of the subsequent trust land
subject to the trust.

Note--

If the designated beneficiary is exempt from land tax under
paragraph (b), the trustee will also be exempt because the effect of the
residential land exemptions is to render the land exempt from land
tax.

         (10)         If land
subject to the trust constitutes the principal place of residence of the
trustee, this section does not affect the application of a residential land
exemption to the land.

         (11)         Any land tax
payable by the trustee under subsection (9)(c) in respect of pre-existing
trust land is to be deducted from land tax payable by the designated
beneficiary.

Note--

The deduction is applied to the total land tax assessed for the designated
beneficiary and not just to the land tax assessed for the land subject to the
trust.

         (12)         If a deduction
under subsection (11) would result in a negative amount--

             (a)         zero is to be substituted for that amount; and

             (b)         the amount of the difference between that amount and zero will not be
credited to any liability for land tax under this Act.

         (13)         Subject to
subsection (14), a beneficiary of a trust may be the designated beneficiary
of the trust for the purposes of this section only if the
beneficiary--

             (a)         is a natural person; and

             (b)         was a beneficiary of the trust at the prescribed time; and

             (c)         is over 18 years of age; and

             (d)         has verified by statutory declaration that the beneficiary consents to
being the designated beneficiary of the trust.

         (14)         Where no
beneficiaries of a trust are over 18 years of age, a notice under this
section may specify that the trustee is to be taken to be the designated
beneficiary (as if the trustee were a beneficiary of the trust) but only if the
trustee is a natural person.

         (15)         For the purposes of this section, a reference to a discretionary
trust does not include a public unit trust scheme.

         (16)         In this section--

"prescribed time" means midnight on the day on which the
Land Tax (Miscellaneous) Amendment Act 2019 was introduced in the
House of Assembly.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 13B
13B--Land
tax for beneficiary/trustees

         (1)         A person
who--

             (a)         holds a
beneficial interest in land subject to a fixed trust in respect of which a
notice is in force under section 12 (the "first trust") as
trustee of another trust (the "second trust") is deemed, for the
purposes of this Act other than a residential land exemption, to be the owner of
land subject to the first trust that bears the same proportion to the whole of
the land subject to the first trust as the person's beneficial interest in the
land subject to the first trust bears to the total beneficial interests in land
subject to the first trust; and

             (b)         holds units in
a unit trust scheme in respect of which a notice is in force under
section 13 (the "first scheme") as trustee of another trust
(the "second trust") is deemed, for the purposes of this Act other
than a residential land exemption, to be the owner of land subject to the first
scheme that bears the same proportion to the whole of the land subject to the
first scheme as the person's unitholding in the first scheme bears to the total
unitholdings in the first scheme.

         (2)         For the purposes of this section, a person referred to in
subsection (1) is called a "beneficiary/trustee".

         (3)         Subject to
subsection (4), there is to be deducted from any land tax payable by a
beneficiary/trustee on land that is subject to the second trust an amount (if
any) necessary to avoid double taxation, being the amount determined by the
formula:

Where--

"A" is--

             (a)         the proportion of the beneficiary/trustee's beneficial interest in
land subject to the first trust to the total beneficial interests in land
subject to the first trust; or

             (b)         the proportion of the beneficiary/trustee's unitholding in the first
scheme to the total unitholdings in the first scheme

"B" is the total amount of land tax assessed on the trustee of
the first trust or the first scheme on the whole of the land subject to the
first trust or first scheme.

         (4)         If a deduction
under subsection (3) would result in a negative amount--

             (a)         zero is to be substituted for that amount; and

             (b)         the amount of the difference between that amount and zero will not be
credited to any liability for land tax under this Act.

         (5)         This section does not apply where the first or second trust, or the
first scheme, is an excluded trust.

are related corporations?

         (1)         For the purposes of this Division, corporations are related
corporations in any of the circumstances specified in this section.

         (2)         Corporations are "related corporations" if 1 of
those corporations--

             (a)         controls the composition of the board of the other corporation;
or

             (b)         is in a position to cast, or control the casting of, more

corporation.

         (3)         Corporations are "related corporations" if the same person

corporations.

Note--

"Controlling interest" is defined in
section 13H.

         (4)         Corporations are "related corporations"
if--

             (a)         more than 50% of the issued share capital of 1 of those
corporations ("corporation 1") is held by the other corporation
("corporation 2") together with the shareholders of
corporation 2; and

             (b)         the percentage of the issued share capital of corporation 2 held

are "related corporations" if 1 of the corporations
("corporation 1") is the trustee of a fixed trust or a unit
trust scheme and another corporation owns, or other related corporations between
them own, more than 50% of--

             (a)         where corporation 1 is the trustee of a fixed trust--the total
beneficial interests in land subject to the trust; or

             (b)         where corporation 1 is the trustee of a unit trust scheme--the
total number of units held by the unit holders in the scheme.

corporations is a related corporation of a corporation of which the other of
those corporations is a related corporation (including a corporation that is a
related corporation of the other of those corporations because of 1 or
more other applications of this subsection).

Example--

If A and B are related corporations and B and C are related
corporations, then by virtue of this provision A and C will also be
related corporations because they are both related to B.

in South Australia;

             (b)         a reference to the issued share capital of a corporation does not
include a reference to any part of it that carries no right to participate
beyond a specified amount in a distribution of either profits or
capital;

another person or corporation are taken to be also held or exercisable by the
other person or corporation;

             (d)         any shares held
or power exercisable by an excluded trust must be disregarded;

             (e)         any shares held
or power exercisable by a person or corporation by virtue of the provisions of
any debentures of another corporation, or of a trust deed for securing any issue
of any such debentures, must be disregarded;

             (f)         any shares held
or power exercisable by, or by a nominee for, a person or corporation (not being
held or exercisable as mentioned in paragraph (e)) are taken to be not held
or exercisable by that person or corporation if--

                   (i)         the ordinary business of that person or corporation includes the
lending of money; and

                   (ii)         the shares are held or the power is exercisable only by way of
security given for the purposes of a transaction entered into in the ordinary
course of business in connection with the lending of money, not being a
transaction entered into with an associate of that person or corporation within
the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 of the
Commonwealth;

             (g)         if a trustee
holds controlling interests in 2 or more corporations on behalf of
different trusts, those corporations are not related to each other only because
of that control;

             (h)         the composition
of a corporation's board is taken to be controlled by a person or another
corporation if the person or other corporation, by the exercise of a power
exercisable whether or not with the consent or concurrence of any other person,
can appoint or remove all or a majority of the members of the board.

         (2)         Subsection (1)(h) does not limit the circumstances in which the
composition of a corporation's board is to be taken to be controlled by a person
or another corporation.

tax.

         (3)         Section 42
of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 applies to the liability
under this section and, accordingly, the Commissioner may issue notices of
assessment for the land tax--

             (a)         to the related corporations jointly; or

             (b)         to the related corporations separately; or

             (c)         to any 2 or more of the related corporations jointly and the
remainder separately.

         (4)         If 2 or more corporations are issued a notice of assessment
jointly under subsection (3), those corporations will, for the purposes of
that notice of assessment, be deemed to be a single corporation.

         (5)         A corporation
that is a related corporation of another corporation may apply to the
Commissioner to be exempted from the application of this Division and to instead
be treated as a single corporation for the purposes of assessment of land tax in
relation to land held by the corporation.

         (6)         The Commissioner may only grant an application under
subsection (5) if the Commissioner is satisfied--

             (a)         that the land is being held for the purpose of being developed as a
residential development of more than 10 allotments or lots;
and

             (b)         as to any other matters prescribed by the regulations.

         (7)         Subject to subsection (9), an exemption granted on an application
under subsection (5) will be for an initial term specified by the
Commissioner in the instrument of exemption (which will be based on the expected
development period but may not exceed a period of 5 years).

         (8)         The initial
term of an exemption may, on application to the Commissioner, be extended for a
further period specified by the Commissioner if the Commissioner is satisfied
that the development of the land is occurring over a reasonable period in the
circumstances.

         (9)         An exemption
will cease if the Commissioner determines that--

             (a)         the development has been substantially completed; or

             (b)         the development has not been substantially commenced within the period
of 2 years after the grant of the application (or such longer period as the
Commissioner may allow).

         (10)         An application under subsection (5) or (8) must be in the
form, and contain the information, determined by the Commissioner.

         (11)         For the avoidance of doubt, the Commissioner may only treat a related
corporation as if it were a single corporation if an exemption has been granted
on an application under subsection (5).

occurring after the commencement of the financial year.

of any land until the amount of the tax in respect of the land has been
paid.

         (3)         The Commissioner may refuse to recognise any change in the ownership
of any land where notice of that change of ownership has not been given as
required by the regulations.

         (4)         Where the Commissioner refuses to recognise a change in the ownership
of any land, the person who is recognised by the Commissioner as the owner of

main or a subsidiary purpose) of in any way directly or
indirectly--

             (a)         altering the incidence of land tax; or

             (b)         relieving any person from liability to pay land tax, or reducing any
such liability; or

             (c)         defeating, evading or avoiding any obligation or liability imposed by
this Act,

the Commissioner may, by notice in writing given to the parties treat that
contract, agreement or arrangement as void for the purposes of this
Act.

         (2)         Where the Commissioner has, in pursuance of this section, treated a
contract, agreement or arrangement as void for the purposes of this Act, it will
be presumed, in any legal proceedings, in the absence of proof to the contrary,
that the purpose of the contract, agreement or arrangement is such as would
attract the operation of this section.

taxpayer liable to pay the tax in respect of the land, on any one of the
taxpayers.

         (2)         If--

             (a)         a person who
otherwise would have been served with an assessment for--

                   (i)         the payment of an amount of land tax; or

                   (ii)         the correct amount of land tax,

has not been served with such an assessment or has been served with an
assessment for an incorrect amount (as the case requires) on account
of--

                   (iii)         gaining an
exemption (or partial exemption) from land tax that should not have applied
under this Act (including by an exemption continuing after it should have come
to an end); or

                   (iv)         receiving a waiver or refund that should not have been given;
or

                   (v)         the liability of a person who owns land as trustee of a trust not
being assessed in accordance with the applicable table under Schedule 1;
or

                   (vi)         an owner's total interest in land not being included in an assessment
in accordance with section 9(6); or

                   (vii)         corporations not being grouped as related corporations in accordance
with section 13G(5); and

             (b)         the failure to serve the assessment, or to serve an assessment for the
correct amount of land tax, is attributable (wholly or in part)
to--

                   (i)         false, misleading or incomplete information that has been provided to
the Commissioner; or

                   (ii)         information or a notification that should have been provided to the
Commissioner not being so provided,

then the provision, or non-provision, of that information (as the case may
be) will be taken to constitute a tax default by the person for the purposes of
the Taxation Administration Act 1996.

         (3)         In connection with the operation of
subsection (2)--

             (a)         the tax default will be taken to have occurred--

                   (i)         in the case of a default resulting in a failure to serve an assessment
for the payment of an amount of land tax on account of a matter referred to in
subsection (2)(a)(iii) or (iv)--on the day on which the exemption
applied from or the waiver or refund was given (as the case may be);
or

                   (ii)         in any other case--on the day on which the liability to an
amount of land tax should have been raised; and

             (b)         an assessment under subsection (1) may specify any interest
accrued or penalty tax payable under the Taxation Administration
Act 1996 in respect of a preceding financial year, including where an
assessment of land tax has not been previously served with respect to that
financial year, or where an assessment served with respect to that financial
year did not identify the tax default; and

             (c)         a liability to pay interest under the Taxation Administration
Act 1996 will accrue from the day applying under paragraph (a)
(and not a day determined under section 25(1) of that Act).

the proceeds will be applied by the Commissioner towards the payment of the
arrears of tax and the costs of proceeding under this section and any surplus
must be paid to the person beneficially entitled to the land or, if the land has

         (1)         Subject to this Act, tax is, until payment, a first charge on the land
in respect of which the tax is payable.

         (2)         Where land tax is levied against the common property, or part of the
common property, of a community scheme under the Community Titles
Act 1996, the tax is not a charge on the common property but is,
instead, a first charge on each of the community lots of the community
scheme.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 23
23--Certificates
in respect of liability to tax

         (1)         Upon
application by the purchaser of any land, or the purchaser's agent, and payment
of the prescribed fee, the Commissioner may issue a certificate showing the
amount (if any) of tax that is, or will be, payable under this Act in respect of
the land on a specified date (the "relevant date").

         (2)         Where the Commissioner is unable to calculate exactly the amount
referred to in subsection (1), the Commissioner may make an estimate of
that amount.

         (3)         Where the land in respect of which an application is made under this
section is only part of the land included in a land tax assessment, the
certificate referred to in subsection (1) must relate to the whole of the
land comprised in the assessment.

         (4)         Where--

             (a)         the amount (if any) stated in a certificate given under this section
is paid within a period specified in the certificate; or

             (b)         the certificate indicates that no amount is or will be
payable,

the purchaser and the purchaser's successors in title are released from any
liability to tax that accrued in respect of the land before the relevant date,
and no such liability is or remains a charge upon the land after it becomes
vested in the purchaser.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 24
24--Alterations
to valuations

The right of the Commissioner to recover tax under this Act is not
suspended or delayed by an objection, review or appeal in relation to a
valuation under the Valuation of Land Act 1971 and the Commissioner
may recover tax on the assumption that the valuation is correct, but if any
alteration to a valuation affecting the amount of land tax payable in respect of
any land is made under that Act (whether in consequence of an objection, review
or appeal, or otherwise) the Commissioner must make a reassessment of the
liability to land tax in respect of the land.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 25
25--Service

         (1)         An assessment or other document to be served on a person for the
purposes of this Act may be served on the person by affixing it conspicuously on
any land to which the assessment or other document relates.

         (2)         This section is in addition to and does not derogate from a provision
of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 as to the service of
documents.

LAND TAX ACT 1936

Section 26
26--Regulations

         (1)         The Governor may make regulations for the purposes of this
Act.
