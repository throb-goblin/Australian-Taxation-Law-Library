The amount of notional duty--dealing with the first year of production (12) When no condensate produced from a particular prescribed condensate production area was ever entered for home consumption before the end of the first month of a particular financial year, then, in ascertaining, in accordance with subsections (5), (6) and (10) or (5), (9) and (10), the notional duty in respect of condensate produced from the production area and entered for home consumption during a later month (the relevant month) of that financial year, those subsections have effect in relation to the condensate as if each reference in a paragraph of subsection (5) to B were a reference to the product of B and the factor ascertained in accordance with the formula: where: \"M\" is the number of days in the period commencing on the day on which condensate produced from the prescribed condensate production area was first entered for home consumption and ending on the end of the relevant month. \"N\" is the number of days in the period commencing on the first day of the financial year and ending on the end of the relevant month. (13) Subsection 12(2) (retrospective application of legislative instruments) of the Legislation Act 2003 does not apply to a by-law prescribing a condensate production area. (13A) Despite section 169 of the Excise Act 1901, a by-law prescribing a condensate production area may have the effect of imposing duty, in relation to condensate entered for home consumption before the date on which the by -law is published in the Gazette, at a rate higher than the rate of duty payable in respect of the condensate on the day on which the condensate was entered for home consumption. Interpretation of the Schedule (14) The words set out after &quot;, if higher,&quot; in the column headed &quot;Rate of Duty&quot; in subitem 21.3 of the Schedule are taken, for the purposes of this Act or any other law of the Commonwealth, to be a rate of duty."

Introduction (2) The amount of duty in respect of intermediate oil ascertained in accordance with this section shall be ascertained by reference to the prescribed intermediate production area from which the oil is produced and to the month of a financial year during which the oil is entered for home consumption. The amount of duty (3) Subject to subsection (3A), the amount of duty in respect of intermediate oil produced from a prescribed intermediate production area and entered for home consumption during a month of a financial year commencing on or after 1 July 1997 is the amount worked out using the formula: where: \"notional duty\" is the amount of notional duty in respect of intermediate oil produced from that area and entered for home consumption during the period starting at the start of that financial year and ending at the end of that month, worked out in accordance with subsection (4). \"debited adjustment amount\" is the debited adjustment amount (if any) for that area and that month, worked out in accordance with subsection (5A). \"duty paid\" is the amount of duty (if any) paid in respect of intermediate oil produced from that area and entered for home consumption during the period starting at the start of that financial year and ending at the end of that month. \"credited adjustment amount\" is the credited adjustment amount (if any) for that area and that month, worked out in accordance with subsection (5B). Disregarding certain amounts when working out amount of duty (3A) In working out, for the purposes of subsection (3), the amount of duty paid in respect of intermediate oil produced from a prescribed intermediate production area and entered for home consumption during a period starting at the start of a financial year and ending at the end of a month of that year, the following amounts are to be disregarded: (a) any increases in the amount of duty paid as a result of the addition of debited adjustment amounts for that area for any of the preceding months of that year; (b) any decreases in that amount as a result of the subtraction of credited adjustment amounts for that area for any of those months. The total amount of notional duty (4) The amount of notional duty in respect of intermediate oil produced from a particular prescribed intermediate production area and entered for home consumption during a particular period is the sum of the amounts of notional duty in respect of: (a) the quantity (if any) of the oil that exceeds but does not exceed ; (b) the quantity (if any) of the oil that exceeds but does not exceed ; (c) the quantity (if any) of the oil that exceeds but does not exceed ; and (d) the quantity (if any) of the oil that exceeds ; where: \"A\" is the number of days in the period. \"B\" is: (a) where the period is in a year in which there"

Note 2: Sections 6A and 6AA effectively change certain rates of duty that appear on the face of this Schedule, especially in items 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10. \"beer\" means a brewed beverage that: (a) is the product of the yeast fermentation of an aqueous extract, being predominantly an aqueous extract of cereals: (i) whether the cereals are malted or unmalted; and (ii) whether or not the aqueous extract contains other sources of carbohydrates; and (b) contains: (i) hops, or extracts of hops, such that the beverage has international bitterness units of not less than 4.0; or (ii) other bitters such that the beverage has a bitterness comparable to that of a beverage mentioned in subparagraph (i); and (c) contains not more than 4.0% by weight of sugars; and (d) has not had added to it, at any time, artificial sweetener; and (e) may have had added to it, at any time, other substances, including flavours, but only if, in the case of substances that contain alcohol (other than spirit distilled from beer), the alcohol did not add more than 0.5% to the total volume of the final beverage; and (f) may have had added to it, at any time, spirit distilled from beer, but only if that spirit did not add more than 0.5% to the total volume of the final beverage; and (g) contains more than 1.15% by volume of alcohol. \"brandy\" means a spirit distilled from grape wine in such a manner that the spirit possesses the taste, aroma and other characteristics generally attributed to brandy. \"grape wine\" has the same meaning as in Subdivision 31-A of the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 . \"lubricant/fluid/oil products\" means the following: (a) lubricant base oils; (b) prepared lubricant additives containing carrier oils; (c) lubricants for engines, gear sets, pumps and bearings; (d) hydraulic fluids; (e) brake fluids; (f) transmission oils; (g) transformer and heat transfer oils. \"other excisable beverage\" means any beverage containing more than 1.15% alcohol by volume, but does not include: (a) beer; or (b) brandy; or (c) wine. \"sugar\" means: (a) monosaccharide; or (b) disaccharide. \"tobacco\" means tobacco leaf subjected to any process other than curing the leaf as stripped from the plant. \"wine\" has the same meaning as in Subdivision 31-A of the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 . Items 1 to 3 of this Schedule do not include any liquor that has been produced for non-commercial purposes, using non-commercial facilities and equipment, other than a liquor that is, or that contains, any spirit obtained by distillation. A reference to alcohol is taken to be a reference to ethyl alcohol. The volume of alcohol contained in goods: (a) is to be taken to be the volume that would be the volume of that alcohol if the alcohol were measured at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius; and (b) if a calculation for the purpose of ascertaining that volume is made by reference to the specific gravity of alcohol--is to be so made on the basis that, at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and in vacuum, the specific gravity of alcohol in relation to water is 0.79067; and (c) subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b)--may be ascertained in accordance with the rules (if any) made for that purpose under section 65 of the Excise Act 1901 ; and (d) if the circumstances set out in section 77FA of the Excise Act 1901 apply and for the purposes of working out the duty payable on the goods--is to be ascertained in accordance with that last -mentioned section.
