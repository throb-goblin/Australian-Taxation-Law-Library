Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 (No.Â 101, 2006) Schedule 6 Section 1 Application of ScheduleÂ 1 and 2 amendments Except as mentioned in itemsÂ 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by SchedulesÂ 1 and 2 apply: (a) so far as they affect assessmentsâto assessments for the 2006- 07 income year and all later income years; and (b) otherwiseâto acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments. Section 6 Object The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of: (a) any act done or omitted to be done; or (b) any state of affairs existing; or (c) any period ending; before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies. Section 7 Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003): (a) making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended); (b) exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended); in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies. Example 1: On 31Â July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former sectionÂ 160ARE of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former sectionÂ 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return. Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of PartÂ IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998- 99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable. The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former sectionÂ 160ARN of that Act, because itemÂ 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. ItemÂ 7 will also disregard the repeal of DivisionÂ 11 of former PartÂ IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltdâs liability to a penalty by way of additional tax. Despite the repeal of sectionsÂ 160ARU and 160ARV, itemÂ 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid. ItemÂ 7 will also preserve Greg Ltdâs right, under former sectionÂ 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissionerâs amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of PartÂ IIIAA. Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employeesâ wages as required by former DivisionsÂ 1AAA and 2 of PartÂ VI of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner. Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The companyâs records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under sectionÂ 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability. ItemÂ 7 will disregard the repeal of sectionÂ 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the"

Section 8 Saving of provisions about effect of assessments If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies. Section 9 Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty If: (a) a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of: (i) general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936); or (ii) interest under the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983; and (b) in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the Taxation Administration Act 1953) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended; then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period. Section 10 Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions If the operation of a provision (the subject provision) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision. Section 11 Schedule does not limit operation of sectionÂ 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 This Schedule does not limit the operation of sectionÂ 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Federal Financial Relations (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2009 (No.Â 12, 2009) Schedule 4 Section 1 Payments for the 2008-09 GST year Despite the amendments to the A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Act 1999 made by this Act, that Act continues to apply, in relation to the 2008-09 GST year (within the meaning of that Act), as if those amendments had not been made. Section 2 Overpayments and underpayments for the 2008-09 GST year (1) If a State has been paid an amount in excess of the amount that, under a provision of the Financial Arrangements Act, it was entitled to receive by way of financial assistance for the 2008-09 GST year, the Minister must deduct an amount equal to the excess from any amount that the State is entitled to receive by way of financial assistance under sectionÂ 5 of the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 for the financial year starting on 1Â July 2009. (2) If a State has been paid less than the amount that, under a provision of the Financial Arrangements Act, it was entitled to receive by way of financial assistance for the 2008-09 GST year, the Minister must add an amount equal to the shortfall to any amount that the State is entitled to receive by way of financial assistance under sectionÂ 5 of the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 for the financial year starting on 1Â July 2009. (3) Payments made under subitemÂ (2) are to be made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly. (4) In this item: Financial Arrangements Act means the A New Tax System (Commonwealth- State Financial Arrangements) Act 1999. GST year has the same meaning as in the Financial Arrangements Act. State includes the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory."
