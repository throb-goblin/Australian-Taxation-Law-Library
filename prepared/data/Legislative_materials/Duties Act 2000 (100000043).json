The value of each dutiable transaction is\n$100 000.  The transactions would have been aggregated under\nsection 24(1) and duty would have been calculated on an aggregated amount\nof $1 000 000.  However, the builder intends to construct residential\npremises on each lot of vacant land.  Section 24(2) applies and the transactions\nare not aggregated and duty is calculated on each transaction\nseparately.\nOn 1 September 2015, the builder on-sells two of the lots without\nbuilding residential premises on them.  Duty is calculated in the following way.\nThe 10 dutiable transactions are aggregated based on the dutiable\nvalue of the dutiable transactions at the time they occurred (10 lots x\n$100 000 = $1 000 000).  The duty that would be payable on the\ndutiable value of the aggregated property is then apportioned to each dutiable\ntransaction.  The builder is re&#8209;assessed for duty in respect of each lot\nthe builder on&#8209;sold, less an allowance for each lot for the duty\npreviously paid on it.  The builder must pay the difference in respect of each\non-sold lot.\n     (4)     A liability for duty charged under this section\narises&#8212;\n         (a)     in the case of subsection (1)(a)&#8212;when the other dutiable\ntransaction occurs;\n         (b)     in the case of subsection (1)(b)&#8212;when the premises are ready for\noccupation or use for the purposes for which they were constructed;\n         (c)     in the case of subsection (1)(c)&#8212;5 years after the date on\nwhich the land was transferred to the transferee.\n     (5)     A reassessment referred to in subsection (2) is authorised if more\nthan 5 years have passed since the initial assessment was made.\nNote\nSection 9(3) of the Taxation Administration Act 1997 allows a\nreassessment to be made more than 5 years after the initial assessment if\nthis is authorised by a taxation law.\n     (6)     If dutiable transactions would have been aggregated under section\n24(1) but were not aggregated because of the operation of section 24(2), the\ntransferee must lodge written notice with the Commissioner within 30 days after\nbecoming aware that any of the circumstances set out in subsection (1) have\noccurred in respect of any of those transactions.\n     (7)     A failure of a transferee to comply with subsection (6) does not\naffect the Commissioner's power to reassess duty under this section."

Concessional rates of duty chargeable on certain dutiable\ntransactions are dealt with in Part 5 of this Chapter.\n[2] Chapter 3: This Chapter\ncharges duty on certain transactions that are not dutiable\ntransactions under Chapter 2.  Duty is chargeable under Part 2 of this\nChapter on the acquisition by a person of an interest consisting of certain\nshareholdings in a private company, or unitholdings in a private unit trust\nscheme, whose property in either case consists, to the prescribed extent, of\nland holdings.\nThe duty is chargeable at the general rate for a dutiable transaction under\nChapter 2, rather than at the rate applicable to transfers of shares and units.\nAn acquisition statement must be lodged when a majority interest is acquired or\nincreased.  Duty on an acquisition statement is chargeable only on interests\nacquired within a 3-year period.  In certain cases the obligation to pay duty at\nthe higher rate is phased-in (see section 87).\nDuty is chargeable&#8212;\nunder Part 3 on transactions by which corporate capital is reduced by\nredemption, surrender or cancellation of shares or reduction of share value or\nalteration of share rights;\nunder Part 4 on the allotment of shares by direction.\n[3] S. 105: Section 10 of the\nFinancial Sector Reform (Victoria) Act 1999, No. 37/1999 provides that\nproperty transferred under Part 3 of the Financial Sector (Business Transfer and\nGroup Restructure) Act 1999 of the Commonwealth (the Commonwealth\nAct) becomes the property of the receiving body when the certificate of\ntransfer issued under section 18 of the Commonwealth Act comes into force under\nDivision 3 of Part 3 of the Commonwealth Act.\n[4] Table of Amendments (State\nTaxation Acts Amendment Act 2023): The amendment proposed by\nsection 15(1) of the State Taxation Acts Amendment Act 2023, No.\n18/2023 is not included in this publication because the heading to section 58 is\nnot considered part of this Act: see section 36(2A) of the Interpretation of\nLegislation Act 1984, No. 10096/1984.\nSection 15(1) reads as follows:\n          15     Section 58 amended\n     (1)     In the heading to section 58 of the Duties Act 2000, for\n\"eligible pensioner?\" substitute \"eligible\ncardholder?\"."
