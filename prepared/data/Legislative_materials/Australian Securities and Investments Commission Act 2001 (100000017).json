      "text": "General definition of financial product (1) Subject to subsection (8), for the purposes of this Division, a financial product is a facility through which, or through the acquisition of which, a person does one or more of the following: (a) makes a financial investment (see subsection (4)); (b) manages financial risk (see subsection (5)); (c) makes non-cash payments (see subsection (6)). (2) Subject to subsection (8), for the purposes of this Division, a particular facility that is of a kind through which people commonly make financial investments, manage financial risks or make non-cash payments is a financial product even if that facility is acquired by a particular person for some other purpose. (3) A facility does not cease to be a financial product merely because: (a) the facility has been acquired by a person other than the person to whom it was originally issued; and (b) that person, in acquiring the product, was not making a financial investment or managing a financial risk. Meaning of makes a financial investment (4) For the purposes of this section, a person (the investor) makes a financial investment if: (a) the investor gives money or money&#39;s worth (the contribution) to another person and any of the following apply: (i) the other person uses the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor; (ii) the investor intends that the other person will use the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); (iii) the other person intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor; and (b) the investor has no day -to-day control over the use of the contribution to generate the return or benefit. Note 1: Examples of actions that constitute making a financial investment under this subsection are: (a) a person paying money to a company for the issue to the person of shares in the company (the company uses the money to generate dividends for the person and the person, as a shareholder, does not have control over the day -to-day affairs of the company); or (b) a person contributing money to acquire interests in a registered scheme from the responsible entity of the scheme (the scheme uses the money to generate financial or other benefits for the person and the person, as a member of the scheme, does not have day -to-day control over the operation of the scheme). Note 2: Examples of actions that do not constitute making a financial investment under this subsection are: (a) a person purchasing real property or bullion (while the property or bullion may generate a return for the person, it is not a return generated by the use of the purchase money by another person); or (b) a person giving money to a financial services licensee who is to use it to purchase shares for the person (while the purchase of the shares will be a financial investment made by the person, the mere act of giving the money to the licensee will not of itself constitute making a financial investment). Meaning of manages a financial risk (5) For the purposes of this section, a person manages financial risk if they: (a) manage the financial consequences to them of particular circumstances happening; or (b) avoid or limit the financial consequences of fluctuations in, or in the value of, receipts or costs (including prices and interest rates). Note 1: Examples of actions that constitute managing a financial risk are: (a) taking out insurance; or (b) hedging a liability by acquiring a futures contract or entering into a currency swap. Note 2: An example of an action that does not constitute managing a financial risk is employing a security firm (while that is a way of managing the risk that thefts will happen, it is not a way of managing the financial consequences if thefts do occur). Meaning of makes non-cash payments (6) For the purposes of this section, a person makes non-cash payments if they make payments, or cause payments to be made, otherwise than by the physical delivery of Australian currency in the form of notes and/or coins. Note: Examples of actions that constitute making non-cash payments are: (a) making payments by means of a facility for direct debit of a deposit account; or (b) making payments by means of a facility for the use of cheques; or (c) making payments by means of a purchased payment facility within the meaning of the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 , such as a smart card;"
