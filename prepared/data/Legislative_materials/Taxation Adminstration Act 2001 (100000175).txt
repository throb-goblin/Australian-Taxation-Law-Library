References to tax
*** 6A References to tax ***
     (1) To enable the use of a simpler style in provisions that apply to
     both taxes and royalties, this Act uses the term âtaxâ which,
     under its definition, includes royalty payable under the Mineral
     Resources Act 1989 and petroleum royalty payable under the Petroleum
     and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004.
     (2) That use of the term âtaxâ, and related terms, must not be
     taken to affect the nature of the payments under those Acts as
     royalties.
 
Appointment of commissioner
*** 7 Appointment of commissioner ***
     (1) There is to be a Commissioner of State Revenue.
     (2) The Governor in Council must, by gazette notice, appoint an

     (3) It does not matter whether the appointee is or is not already a
     public service officer.
     (4) The commissioner is to be employed under the Public Sector Act
     2022.

When commissioner makes an assessment
*** 11 When commissioner makes an assessment ***
     (1) The commissioner must make an assessment ifâ
          (a) the commissioner is satisfied a taxpayer has a
          liability for tax; and
          (b) the taxpayerâs liability is not required or
          permitted, under a revenue law, to be made by self
          assessment.
     (2) Also, the commissioner may make an assessmentâ
          (a) if the taxpayerâs liability for tax is required or
          permitted to be made by self assessment under the revenue
          law; or
          (b) even if the taxpayerâs liability for tax is nil.
     (3) If the commissioner does not make an assessment under subsection
     (2), the commissionerâs decision not to make the assessment is a
     non-reviewable decision.
 
Compromise assessments
*** 12 Compromise assessments ***
     (1) This section applies if, in assessing a taxpayerâs liability
     for tax, it is difficult or impracticable for the commissioner to
     properly determine the amount of the taxpayerâs liability because
     of a complexity or uncertainty or for another reason.
     (2) The commissioner may make an assessment of the taxpayerâs
     liability under a written agreement with the taxpayer (a
     "compromise assessment").
     (3) The compromise assessment is a non-reviewable decision.
     (4) Nothing in this part requires the commissioner to make a
     compromise assessment for a taxpayer.
 
Default assessments
*** 13 Default assessments ***
     (1) This section applies in each of the following circumstancesâ
          (a) forâ
               (i) a self assessmentâthe assessment is not
               made; or
               (ii) another assessmentâthe taxpayer does not
               give information required to be given under an
               information requirement or lodge a document
               required to be lodged under a lodgement
               requirement;
          (b) the commissioner is not satisfied about the accuracy or
          completeness of a document lodged, or information given,
          for the assessment of a taxpayerâs liability for tax
          under a tax law;
          (c) the commissioner does not have enough information to
          properly assess a taxpayerâs liability for tax under a
          tax law, including, for example, if the commissioner
          reasonably believesâ
               (i) it is necessary to make an immediate
               assessment; and
               (ii) the time for complying with an information
               or lodgement requirement has not ended.
               Example for subsection (1)(c)â
                    The commissioner reasonably believes a
                    taxpayer is going to leave the State
                    before documents that will disclose a
                    liability for tax are required to be
                    lodged.
     (2) The commissioner may make an assessment under this section (a
     "default assessment") for the amount the commissioner reasonably
     believes to be the taxpayerâs liability.
     (3) If this section applies because a lodgement requirement has not
     been complied with (whether or not the time for compliance has
     ended), the commissioner may make the default assessment as if the
     document were in existence and in the commissionerâs possession.
 
Assessment may be made despite related objections, appeals or reviews

     (b) the assessment under paragraph (a) is taken to have been made by
     the commissioner;
     (c) the liability for tax for each assessment is the amount that, on
     the basis of the information stated in the return, is the amount of

     was made.
     (2) If any legislative change made after an original assessment is
     made affects the legal interpretations and assessment practices to be
     applied under subsection (1), the reassessment must, to the extent
     that the interpretations and practices are changed because of the
     legislative change, be made in accordance with the changed
     interpretations and practices.
     (3) The commissionerâs decision about what constituted the

          liability for tax; and
          (b) on appeal, the original decision is changed in whole or

     (3) Late payment interest accrues at the prescribed rate on the
     unpaid primary tax as followsâ
          (a) for unpaid primary tax under a royalty law, late

          date;

          royalty law, late payment interest accruesâ
               (i) on the day of the week prescribed by
               regulation first happening after the start date;
               and
               (ii) weekly after the first accrual under
               subparagraph (i).
     (4) Any unpaid tax interest that has accrued when an assessment is
     made (
     "assessed interest") must be included in the assessment.
     (5) For subsections (2) and (3), the start date is the day afterâ
          (a) for a return self assessmentâthe date the return is
          required to be lodged under the revenue law for the self
          assessment; or
          (aa) for a standard self assessmentâ
               (i) the due date for the self assessment; or
               (ii) if the self assessor has not complied with
               one or more lodgement requirements for the self
               assessmentâthe date that is the same number of
               days before the due date for the self assessment
               as the number of days in the periods of
               noncompliance with the lodgement requirements; or
               (iii) if the liable party has not complied with
               the Duties Act 2001, section 471E âthe date
               that is the same number of days before the due
               date for the self assessment as the number of
               days in the period of noncompliance with the
               Duties Act 2001, section 471E; or
               (iv) if subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) both
               applyâthe date that is the same number of days
               before the due date for the self assessment as
               the total number of days of noncompliance; or
          (b) for a default assessment of a taxpayerâs liability
          for tax required or permitted to be made by a self
          assessmentâthe date the return or transaction statement
          is required to be lodged under the revenue law for the self
          assessment; or
          (c) for another original assessmentâ
               (i) the due date for the assessment; or
               (ii) if the taxpayer has not complied with 1 or
               more information or lodgement requirements for
               the assessmentâthe date that is the same number
               of days before the due date for the assessment as
               the number of days in the periods of
               noncompliance with the information or lodgement
               requirements; or
          (d) for a reassessment of a self assessmentâthe date
          mentioned in paragraph (a) or (aa) for the assessment; or
          (e) for a reassessment of another original assessmentâthe
          date mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) for the assessment.
          Example for subsection (5)(c)(ii)â
               If a taxpayer who is required to comply with a
               lodgement requirement by 10 March does not comply
               with the requirement until 15 March, the period
               of noncompliance under subsection (6) is 5 days.
               If the due date for the assessment made is 17
               April, the start date is 13 April.
     (6) For subsection (5) (aa) (ii), (iii) and (iv) or (c)(ii)â
          (a) a period of noncompliance ends on the date the
          commissioner issues a default assessment for the
          noncompliance; and
          (b) the date on which the requirement is complied with is
          included in calculating a period of noncompliance.
     (7) For a reassessmentâ
          (a) the unpaid primary tax is the amount of the reassessed
          primary tax that is unpaid; and
          (b) any assessed interest included in the reassessment
          replaces any previously accrued unpaid tax interest.
          Example for subsection (7)â
               The assessment for the example for subsection (5)
               (c) (ii) is issued for $10,000 primary tax and
               before any payment under the original assessment
               is made. A reassessment is issued on 24 April for
               $12,000 primary tax.
               If the prescribed rate for late payment interest
               is 10% per year, the late payment interest that
               has accrued on the $10,000 when the reassessment
               is made (namely on and from 13 April to and
               including 24 April) is $32.87. When the
               reassessment is made, assessed interest is
               calculated on the $12,000 unpaid reassessed
               primary tax on and from 13 April to and including
               24 April. This replaces the $32.87 interest
               previously accrued.
               If a payment of $10,000 is made on 12 April, the
               assessed interest for the reassessment would be
               calculated on the unpaid reassessed primary tax
               of $2,000 on and from 13 April to and including
               24 April.
     (8) A reference in this section to an amount of primary tax payable
     by a taxpayer does not include a reference to an amount of royalty
     payable under the Mineral Resources Act 1989 to a person other than
     the State.
     (9) Despite subsections (2) and (3) (a), a regulation under a royalty
     law may prescribe how unpaid tax interest is worked out in particular
     cases or classes of cases, including, for example, how the interest
     is worked out if royalty is, under a regulation under a royalty law,
     payable in instalments.
     (10) In this sectionâ

     "liable party" see the Duties Act 2001, section 471A.

     "total number of days of noncompliance" means the total number of
     days worked out by adding the number of days in the period of
     noncompliance in subsection (5) (aa) (ii) to the number of days in
     the period of noncompliance in subsection (5) (aa) (iii).
