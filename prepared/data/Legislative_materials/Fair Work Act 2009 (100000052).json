Note: An employee who commences employment as a casual employee remains a casual employee until the occurrence of a specified event (see subsection (5)). Indicia that apply for purposes of general rule (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), whether the employment relationship is characterised by an absence of a firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work is to be assessed: (a) on the basis of the real substance, practical reality and true nature of the employment relationship; and (b) on the basis that a firm advance commitment can be in the form of the contract of employment or, in addition to the terms of that contract, in the form of a mutual understanding or expectation between the employer and employee not rising to the level of a term of that contract (or to a variation of any such term); and (c) having regard to, but not limited to, the following considerations (which may indicate the presence, rather than an absence, of such a commitment): (i) whether there is an inability of the employer to elect to offer, or not offer, work or an inability of the employee to elect to accept or reject work (and whether this occurs in practice); (ii) whether, having regard to the nature of the employer&#39;s enterprise, it is reasonably likely that there will be future availability of continuing work in that enterprise of the kind usually performed by the employee; (iii) whether there are full -time employees or part-time employees performing the same kind of work in the employer&#39;s enterprise that is usually performed by the employee; (iv) whether there is a regular pattern of work for the employee. Note: A regular pattern of work does not of itself indicate a firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work. An employee who has a regular pattern of work may still be a casual employee if there is no firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work. (3) To avoid doubt: (a) for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), a mutual understanding or expectation may be inferred from conduct of the employer and employee after entering into the contract of employment or from how the contract is performed; and (b) the considerations referred to in paragraph (2)(c) must all be considered but no single consideration is determinative and not all considerations necessarily need to be satisfied for an employee to be considered as other than a casual employee; and (c) a pattern of work is regular for the purposes of subparagraph (2)(c)(iv) even if it is not absolutely uniform and includes some fluctuation or variation over time (including for reasonable absences such as for illness, injury or recreation). Exceptions to general rule (4) Despite subsection (1), an employee is not a casual employee of an employer if: (a) the contract of employment includes a term that provides the contract will terminate at the end of an identifiable period (whether or not the contract also includes other terms that provide for circumstances in which it may be terminated before the end of that period); and (b) the employee is a member of the academic staff or teaching staff of a higher education institution; and (c) the employee is covered by one of the following modern awards: (i) the Higher Education Industry -Academic Staff-Award 2020 as in force from time to time; (ii) the Higher Education Industry -General Staff-Award 2020 as in force from time to time; and (d) the employee is not a State public sector employee of a State within the meaning of subsection 30A(1). Note 1: A modern award covers an employee if the award is expressed to cover the employee, even if the modern award does not apply to the employee because an enterprise agreement applies to the employee in relation to that particular employment (see subsection 57(1) which deals with interaction between modern awards and enterprise agreements).

      "text": "General meaning (1) A period of service by a national system employee with his or her national system employer is a period during which the employee is employed by the employer, but does not include any period (an excluded period) that does not count as service because of subsection (2). (2) The following periods do not count as service: (a) any period of unauthorised absence; (b) any period of unpaid leave or unpaid authorised absence, other than: (i) a period of absence under Division 8 of Part 2-2 (which deals with community service leave); or (ii) a period of stand down under Part 3-5, under an enterprise agreement that applies to the employee, or under the employee&#39;s contract of employment; or (iii) a period of leave or absence of a kind prescribed by the regulations; (c) any other period of a kind prescribed by the regulations. (3) An excluded period does not break a national system employee&#39;s continuous service with his or her national system employer, but does not count towards the length of the employee&#39;s continuous service. (3A) Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) may prescribe different kinds of periods for the purposes of different provisions of this Act (other than provisions to which subsection (4) applies). If they do so, subsection (3) applies accordingly. Meaning for Divisions 4 and 5, and Subdivision A of Division 11, of Part 2-2 (4) For the purposes of Divisions 4 and 5, and Subdivision A of Division 11, of Part 2-2: (a) a period of service by a national system employee with his or her national system employer is a period during which the employee is employed by the employer, but does not include: (i) any period of unauthorised absence; or (ii) any other period of a kind prescribed by the regulations; and (b) a period referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii) does not break a national system employee&#39;s continuous service with his or her national system employer, but does not count towards the length of the employee&#39;s continuous service; and (c) subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not apply. Note: Divisions 4 and 5, and Subdivision A of Division 11, of Part 2-2 deal, respectively, with requests for flexible working arrangements, parental leave and related entitlements, and notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice. (4A) Regulations made for the purposes of subparagraph (4)(a)(ii) may prescribe different kinds of periods for the purposes of different provisions to which subsection (4) applies. If they do so, paragraph (4)(b) applies accordingly. When service with one employer counts as service with another employer (5) If there is a transfer of employment (see subsection (7)) in relation to a national system employee: (a) any period of service of the employee with the first employer counts as service of the employee with the second employer; and (b) the period between the termination of the employment with the first employer and the start of the employment with the second employer does not break the employee&#39;s continuous service with the second employer (taking account of the effect of paragraph (a)), but does not count towards the length of the employee&#39;s continuous service with the second employer. Note: This subsection does not apply to a transfer of employment between non-associated entities, for the purpose of Division 6 of Part 2-2 (which deals with annual leave) or Subdivision B of Division 11 of Part 2-2 (which deals with redundancy pay), if the second employer decides not to recognise the employee&#39;s service with the first employer for the purpose of that Division or Subdivision (see subsections 91(1) and 122(1)). (6) If the national system employee has already had the benefit of an entitlement the amount of which was calculated by reference to a period of service with the first employer, subsection (5) does not result in that period of service with the first employer being counted again when calculating the employee&#39;s entitlements of that kind as an employee of the second employer. Note: For example: (a) the accrued paid annual leave to which the employee is entitled as an employee of the second employer does not include any period of paid annual leave that the employee has already taken as an employee of the first employer; and (b) if an employee receives notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice in relation to a period of service with the first employer, that period of service is not counted again in calculating the amount of notice of termination, or payment in lieu, to which the employee is entitled as an employee of the second employer."

This subsection has effect subject to subsection (6). (2) A State is a referring State even if: (a) the State&#39;s referral law provides that the reference to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of any or all of the matters covered by subsections (3), (4) and (5) is to terminate in particular circumstances; or (b) the State&#39;s referral law provides that particular matters, or all matters, relating to State public sector employees, or State public sector employers, of the State are not included in any or all of the matters covered by subsections (3), (4) and (5); or (c) the State&#39;s referral law provides that particular matters, or all matters, relating to local government employees, or local government employers, of the State are not included in any or all of the matters covered by subsections (3), (4) and (5). Reference covering referred provisions (3) This subsection covers the matters to which the referred provisions relate to the extent of making laws with respect to those matters by amending this Act, as originally enacted, and as subsequently amended by amendments enacted at any time before the State&#39;s referral law commenced, to include the referred provisions. Reference covering amendments (4) This subsection covers the referred subject matters to the extent of making laws with respect to those matters by making express amendments of this Act. Reference covering transitional matters (5) This subsection covers making laws with respect to the transition from the regime provided for by: (a) the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (as it continues to apply because of the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009); or (b) a law of a State relating to workplace relations or industrial relations; to the regime provided for by this Act. Effect of termination of reference (6) Despite anything to the contrary in a referral law of a State, a State ceases to be a referring State if any or all of the following occurs: (a) the State&#39;s initial reference terminates; (b) the State&#39;s amendment reference terminates, and neither of subsections (7) and (8) apply to the termination; (c) the State&#39;s transition reference terminates. (7) A State does not cease to be a referring State because of the termination of its amendment reference if: (a) the termination is effected by the Governor of that State fixing a day by proclamation as the day on which the reference terminates; and (b) the day fixed is no earlier than the first day after the end of the period of 6 months beginning on the day on which the proclamation is published; and (c) that State&#39;s amendment reference, and the amendment reference of every other referring State (other than a referring State that has terminated its amendment reference in the circumstances referred to in subsection (8)), terminate on the same day. (8) A State does not cease to be a referring State because of the termination of its amendment reference if: (a) the termination is effected by the Governor of that State fixing a day by proclamation as the day on which the reference terminates; and (b) the day fixed is no earlier than the first day after the end of the period of 3 months beginning on the day on which the proclamation is published; and (c) the Governor of that State, as part of the proclamation by which the termination is to be effected, declares that, in the opinion of the Governor, this Act: (i) is proposed to be amended (by an amendment introduced into the Parliament by a Minister); or (ii) has been amended; in a manner that is inconsistent with one or more of the fundamental workplace relations principles.

(2A) However, if the first or only period of leave covered by the notice is leave to be taken under section 72A, the notice may be given at any later time if the employer agrees. (3) If any of the leave covered by the notice is to be taken under section 71, the notice must specify the intended start and end dates of the leave to be taken under section 71. (3C) If any of the leave covered by the notice is to be taken under section 72A, the notice must specify the total number of days (flexible days) of flexible unpaid parental leave that the employee intends to take in relation to the child. (3D) If the employer agrees, the employee may: (a) reduce the number of flexible days, including by reducing the number of flexible days to zero; or (b) increase the number of flexible days, but not so as to increase the number of flexible days above 100 (or, if a higher number of days is prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of subsection 72A(1), that higher number). Taking leave under section 71--confirming or changing intended start and end dates (4) If any of the leave covered by the notice is to be taken under section 71, then at least 4 weeks before the intended start date specified in the notice given under subsection (1), the employee must: (a) confirm the intended start and end dates of the leave to be taken under section 71; or (b) advise the employer of any changes to the intended start and end dates of the leave to be taken under section 71; unless it is not practicable to do so. Taking flexible unpaid parental leave--notifying days on which employee will take leave (4B) The employee must give the employer written notice of a flexible day on which the employee will take flexible unpaid parental leave: (a) at least 4 weeks before that day; or (b) if that is not practicable--as soon as practicable (which may be a time after the leave has started). Note: Whether or not it is practicable for the employee to give notice at least 4 weeks before that day will depend on the employee&#39;s personal and family circumstances. For example, it may not be practicable for the employee to give notice at least 4 weeks before that day where the employee experiences a health issue, a pregnancy complication or an unexpected change in the employee&#39;s child care arrangements. (4C) If the employer agrees, the employee may change a day on which the employee takes flexible unpaid parental leave from a day specified in a notice under subsection (4B). Evidence requirements (5) An employee who has given the employee&#39;s employer notice of the taking of unpaid parental leave must, if required by the employer, give the employer evidence that would satisfy a reasonable person: (a) if the leave is birth -related leave: (i) of the date of birth, or the expected date of birth, of the child; and (ii) that paragraph 77A(1)(a) (which deals with the stillbirth of a child) applies in relation to the employee, if relevant; or (b) if the leave is adoption -related leave: (i) of the day of placement, or the expected day of placement, of the child; and (ii) that the child is, or will be, under 16 as at the day of placement, or the expected day of placement, of the child. (6) Without limiting subsection (5), an employer may require the evidence referred to in paragraph (5)(a) to be a medical certificate. Example: If the application of paragraph 77A(1)(a) (which deals with the stillbirth of a child) is relevant--certification by a medical practitioner of the child as having been delivered.

For example, if the employer has only a small number of employees, there may be no capacity to change the working arrangements of other employees to accommodate the request (see paragraph  (5)(b)).\nEmployer must explain grounds for refusal\n (6) If the employer refuses the request, the written response under subsection  (1) must:\n (a) include details of the reasons for the refusal; and\n (b) without limiting paragraph  (a) of this subsection:\n (i) set out the employer&#39;s particular business grounds for refusing the request; and\n (ii) explain how those grounds apply to the request; and\n (c) either:\n (i) set out the extension of the period of unpaid parental leave for the employee (other than the period requested by the employee) that the employer would be willing to agree to; or\n (ii) state that there is no extension of the period that the employer would be willing to agree to; and\n (d) set out the effect of sections  76B and 76C.\nGenuinely trying to reach an agreement\n (7) This section does not affect, and is not affected by, the meaning of the expression &quot;genuinely trying to reach an agreement&quot;, or any variant of the expression, as used elsewhere in this Act."

However, a term of a modern award or an enterprise agreement has no effect to the extent it contravenes section  55 (see section 56).\nResolving disputes\n (2) In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must attempt to resolve the dispute at the workplace level, by discussions between the parties.\nFWC may deal with disputes\n (3) If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute may refer the dispute to the FWC.\n  (4) If a dispute is referred under subsection  (3):\n (a) the FWC must first deal with the dispute by means other than arbitration, unless there are exceptional circumstances; and\n (b) the FWC may deal with the dispute by arbitration in accordance with section  76C.\nNote: For the purposes of paragraph (a), the FWC may deal with the dispute as it considers appropriate. The FWC commonly deals with disputes by conciliation. The FWC may also deal with the dispute by mediation, making a recommendation or expressing an opinion (see subsection  595(2)).\nRepresentatives\n (5) The employer or employee may appoint a person or industrial association to provide the employer or employee (as the case may be) with support or representation for the purposes of:\n (a) resolving the dispute; or\n (b) the FWC dealing with the dispute.\nNote: A person may be represented by a lawyer or paid agent in a matter before the FWC only with the permission of the FWC (see section  596)."

Modern awards may set minimum terms and conditions for national system employees in particular industries or occupations. Modern awards can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards (see Part  2-1).Division 2 provides for the modern awards objective. This requires the FWC to ensure that modern awards, together with the National Employment Standards, provide a fair and relevant minimum safety net of terms and conditions, taking into account certain social and economic factors. Division  2 also contains special provisions about modern award minimum wages.Division 3 deals with the terms of modern awards.Division 4A provides for the FWC to conduct 4 yearly reviews of default fund terms of modern awards.It also sets out the process for making the Schedule of Approved Employer MySuper products in a 4 yearly review, and amending the schedule after it is made to include other employer MySuper products. If an employer MySuper product is on the schedule, an employer covered by a modern award can make contributions, for the benefit of a default fund employee, to a superannuation fund that offers the product (see subsection  149D(1A)).Division 5 provides for the FWC to exercise modern award powers in certain circumstances.Division 6 contains some general provisions relating to modern award powers.Division 7 contains additional provisions relating to modern enterprise awards.Division 8 contains additional provisions relating to State reference public sector modern awards.The obligation to comply with a modern award is in section 45 (in Part  2-1).In relation to minimum wages in modern awards, the FWC has powers both under this Part and under Part  2-6 (which deals with minimum wages). The following is a summary of the FWC&#39;s powers under the 2 Parts: (a) the initial making of a modern award setting modern award minimum wages can only occur under this Part; (b) the main power to vary modern award minimum wages is in annual wage reviews under Part 2-6; (c) modern award minimum wages can also be varied under this Part, but only for work value reasons or in other limited circumstances; (d) modern award minimum wages can be set (otherwise than in the initial making of a modern award) or revoked either under this Part or in annual wage reviews under Part  2-6."

An enterprise agreement (including a greenfields agreement) may be a single -enterprise agreement or a multi-enterprise agreement.Division 3 deals with the right of employees to be represented by a bargaining representative during bargaining for a proposed enterprise agreement. It also sets out the persons who are bargaining representatives for such agreements.Subdivision A of Division 4 deals with the approval of proposed enterprise agreements by employees and sets out when an enterprise agreement is made.Subdivision B of Division 4 deals with the approval of enterprise agreements by the FWC. The remaining Subdivisions of the Division deal with certain approval requirements, including in relation to genuine agreement by employees and the better off overall test.Division 5 deals with the mandatory terms of enterprise agreements relating to individual flexibility arrangements, consultation requirements and the rights of workplace delegates.Division 6 deals with the base rate of pay under an enterprise agreement.Division 7 deals with the variation and termination of enterprise agreements.Division 8 provides for the FWC to facilitate bargaining by making bargaining orders, intractable bargaining declarations, majority support determinations and scope orders. It also permits bargaining representatives to apply for the FWC to deal with bargaining disputes.Division 9 provides for the making of supported bargaining authorisations in relation to proposed multi -enterprise agreements. The effect of such an authorisation is that specified employers are subject to certain rules that would not otherwise apply (for example, bargaining orders that would not usually be available for multi -enterprise agreements will be available). It also permits the FWC to assist the bargaining representatives for such agreements.Division 10 deals with single interest employer authorisations.Division 11 deals with other matters relating to enterprise agreements."

(2) A person is also a removed person if: (a) on or after 1 July 2024 and before the Construction and General Division and its branches are placed under administration by force of subsection 323A(1) of the Registered Organisations Act, the person, by the person&#39;s own choice: (i) ceases to be an officer (within the meaning of this Act) of the Construction and General Division or any of its branches; or (ii) ceases to be a person employed by the CFMEU or any of its branches, divisions or parts working in the Construction and General Division or any of its branches; or (iii) ceases to be a workplace delegate for members of the Construction and General Division or any of its branches; and (b) during the period of the administration, the administrator formed the opinion that, if the person had not made the choice, the administrator would have taken action under the scheme of administration to ensure the person ceased to be an officer, employee or workplace delegate (as applicable). Removed person must not be bargaining representative without a certificate (3) A removed person must not do any of the following, whether in their personal capacity or any other capacity: (a) be a bargaining representative of an employee or employer; (b) purport to be a bargaining representative of an employee or employer; (c) hold out that the person is a bargaining representative of an employee or employer. Note: This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1). (4) Subsection (3) does not apply if the removed person holds a certificate granted under subsection (7). (5) If, in proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order against a removed person for a contravention of subsection (3), the person wishes to rely on the exception in subsection (4), the person bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter. (6) Subsection (3) has effect despite subsection 176(1) and section 177. However, subsection (3) does not prevent an employee who will be covered by the agreement concerned from appointing themselves under paragraph 176(1)(c) as their own bargaining representative for the agreement. Certificate to be a bargaining representative (7) The FWC may, on application in writing by a removed person, grant the person a certificate to be a bargaining representative, if satisfied that the person is a fit and proper person to be a bargaining representative. (8) In deciding whether the removed person is a fit and proper person to be a bargaining representative, the FWC must have regard to the following matters: (a) the reasons the person became a removed person, including whether the person engaged or allegedly engaged in a kind of conduct described in subparagraph 141(1)(c)(i), (ii) or (iii) of the Registered Organisations Act; (b) whether the person has ever been convicted of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country involving: (i) fraud or dishonesty; or (ii) intentional use of violence against another person; or (iii) intentional damage or destruction of property; (c) the general character of the person. (9) The FWC may also have regard to any other matters the FWC considers relevant.

(1B) For the purposes of paragraph (1A)(b), the FWC may work out whether a majority of the affected employees want to be covered by the agreement using any method the FWC considers appropriate.

(3A) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(a), matters that may be relevant to determining whether the employers have a common interest include the following: (a) geographical location; (b) regulatory regime; (c) the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement relates, and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises.

Note: A person must not coerce another person to exercise a workplace right in a particular way (see section 343). (2C) Without limiting subparagraph (2B)(b)(iii), the bargaining representative may request that the relevant employees vote by ballot or by an electronic method.

For employees covered by modern awards, minimum wages are specified in the modern award. For award/agreement free employees, minimum wages are specified in the national minimum wage order.Division 2 provides for the minimum wages objective. This requires the FWC to establish and maintain a safety net of fair minimum wages, taking into account certain social and economic factors.Division 3 provides for the FWC (constituted by an Expert Panel) to conduct annual wage reviews. In an annual wage review, the FWC may set or vary minimum wages in modern awards, and must make a national minimum wage order. Minimum wages in modern awards can also be set, or varied (in limited circumstances), under Part  2-3 (which deals with modern awards).Division 4 provides for national minimum wage orders and requires employers to comply with them. The orders set the national minimum wage, as well as special national minimum wages for junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with a disability. The orders also set the casual loading for award/agreement free employees.National minimum wages and special national minimum wages apply to award/agreement free employees. However, they are also relevant to other employees as follows: (a) in setting or varying modern award minimum wages, the FWC must take the national minimum wage into account (see subsection 135(2) (in Part  2-3) and subsection 285(3) (in this Part)); (b) for an employee who is not covered by a modern award and to whom an enterprise agreement applies, the employee&#39;s base rate of pay under the agreement must not be less than the relevant national minimum wage or special national minimum wage (see subsection  206(3) (in Part 2-4)).For an employee who is covered by a modern award and to whom an enterprise agreement applies, the employee&#39;s base rate of pay under the agreement must not be less than the base rate of pay that would have been payable to the employee if the award applied (see subsection  206(1) (in Part  2-4))."

Note: The FWC may make other decisions under this Part which relate to regulated labour hire arrangement orders: see Subdivisions C (short -term arrangements) and D (alternative protected rate of pay orders) of this Division, and Division 3 (dealing with disputes). (1A) Despite subsection (1), the FWC must not make the order unless it is satisfied that the performance of the work is not or will not be for the provision of a service, rather than the supply of labour, having regard to the matters in subsection (7A). (2) Despite subsection (1), the FWC must not make the order if the FWC is satisfied that it is not fair and reasonable in all the circumstances to do so, having regard to any matters in subsection (8) in relation to which submissions have been made. (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), it does not matter: (a) whether the supply is the result of an agreement, or one or more agreements; or (b) if there are one or more agreements relating to the supply--whether an agreement is between: (i) the regulated host and the employer; or (ii) the regulated host and a person other than the employer; or (iii) the employer and a person other than the regulated host; or (iv) any 2 persons who are neither the regulated host nor the employer; or (c) whether the regulated host and employer are related bodies corporate. Note: If related bodies corporate with different corporate branding do not provide labour to each other, a regulated labour hire arrangement order cannot be made because labour is not supplied in the way mentioned in paragraph (1)(a). (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), in determining whether a covered employment instrument would apply to the employees, it does not matter on what basis the employees are or would be employed. Regulated employee and host employment instrument (5) An employee referred to in paragraph (1)(a) is a regulated employee. (6) The covered employment instrument referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is a host employment instrument. Who may apply for an order (7) The following persons may apply for the order: (a) a regulated employee; (b) an employee of the regulated host; (c) an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of an employee mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b); (d) the regulated host. Matters that must be considered in relation to whether work is for the provision of a service (7A) For the purposes of subsection (1A), the matters are as follows: (a) the involvement of the employer in matters relating to the performance of the work; (b) the extent to which, in practice, the employer or a person acting on behalf of the employer directs, supervises or controls (or will direct, supervise or control) the regulated employees when they perform the work, including by managing rosters, assigning tasks or reviewing the quality of the work; (c) the extent to which the regulated employees use or will use systems, plant or structures of the employer to perform the work; (d) the extent to which either the employer or another person is or will be subject to industry or professional standards or responsibilities in relation to the regulated employees; (e) the extent to which the work is of a specialist or expert nature. Matters to be considered if submissions are made (8) For the purposes of subsection (2), the matters are as follows: (a) the pay arrangements that apply to employees of the regulated host (or related bodies corporate of the regulated host) and the regulated employees, including in relation to: (i) whether the host employment instrument applies only to a particular class or group of employees; and (ii) whether, in practice, the host employment instrument has ever applied to an employee at a classification, job level or grade that would be applicable to the regulated employees; and (iii) the rate of pay that would be payable to the regulated employees if the order were made; (c) the history of industrial arrangements applying"

FWC must decide whether to make variation order (5) The FWC must: (a) decide whether to make an order under this section varying the regulated labour hire arrangement order in accordance with subsection (6) or (7) to cover: (i) any or all of the new employers; and (ii) relevant regulated employees of those employers; and (b) take all reasonable steps to make the decision before the time any of those employees start to perform the work referred to in paragraph (1)(b). (6) The FWC must vary the regulated labour hire arrangement order to cover a new employer and the relevant regulated employees of the employer if the regulated host and the new employer notify the FWC that the regulated host and the new employer agree to the making of the variation. (7) Subject to subsections (8) and (9), the FWC must also vary the regulated labour hire arrangement order to cover a new employer and the relevant regulated employees of the employer if the FWC is satisfied of the matters referred to in subsection 306E(1) in relation to the regulated host, the new employer and the relevant regulated employees. (8) The FWC must not vary the regulated labour hire arrangement order in accordance with subsection (7) unless the FWC is satisfied that the performance of the work by the relevant regulated employees is not or will not be for the provision of a service, rather than the supply of labour, having regard to the matters referred to in subsection 306E(7A) in relation to the new employer and the relevant regulated employees. (9) The FWC must not vary the regulated labour hire arrangement order in accordance with subsection (7) if the FWC is satisfied that it is not fair and reasonable in all the circumstances to make the variation, having regard to any matters referred to in subsection 306E(8) in relation to which submissions have been made in respect of the variation.

      "text": "Application of section (1) This section applies if a regulated labour hire arrangement order is in force that covers a regulated host, an employer and a regulated employee of the employer. Employer must not pay less than protected rate of pay (2) The employer must pay the regulated employee at no less than the protected rate of pay for the employee in connection with the work performed by the employee for the regulated host. Note: This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1). Exceptions (3) The employer does not contravene subsection (2) if the employer pays the regulated employee at less than the protected rate of pay because: (a) the regulated host provides information to the employer under section 306H (which deals with information about the protected rate of pay); and (b) the employer reasonably relies on the information for the purposes of working out the protected rate of pay for the regulated employee; and (c) the information is incorrect in a material particular. (3A) The employer does not contravene subsection (2) if: (a) the regulated labour hire arrangement order covers the employer because of the operation of subsection 306ED(11); and (b) the employer pays the regulated employee at less than the protected rate of pay because the employer has not been either: (i) notified that the regulated host has made an application under subsection 306ED(2) (which deals with certain variation orders); or (ii) for an employer who was a successful tenderer in a tender process--advised under subsection 306EE(2) or (3) (which deal with notifying tenderers) in relation to the regulated labour hire arrangement order. Meaning of protected rate of pay (4) Unless subsection (5) applies, the protected rate of pay for the regulated employee is the full rate of pay that would be payable to the employee if the host employment instrument covered by the regulated labour hire arrangement order were to apply to the employee. (5) If the regulated employee is a casual employee, and there is no covered employment instrument that applies to the regulated host that provides for work of that kind to be performed by casual employees, the protected rate of pay for the regulated employee is the full rate of pay that would be payable to the employee if: (a) the employee were an employee other than a casual employee and the host employment instrument covered by the regulated labour hire arrangement order were to apply to the employee; and (b) the base rate of pay that would be payable to the employee, in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (a), were increased by 25%. (6) Despite subsections (4) and (5), if the employer is a national system employer only because of section 30D or 30N, the protected rate of pay for the regulated employee does not include any amount that relates to an excluded subject matter within the meaning of subsection 30A(1) or 30K(1). Note: Sections 30D and 30N extend the meaning of national system employer. (7) If the regulated employee is a pieceworker and paragraph 16(2)(b) would apply to the employee were the host employment instrument to apply to the employee, the base rate of pay that would be payable to the employee for the purposes of subsection (5) of this section is taken to be the base rate of pay that would be referred to in that paragraph. (8) If the regulated employee is a pieceworker and paragraph 18(2)(b) would apply to the employee were the host employment instrument to apply to the employee, the full rate of pay that would be payable to the employee for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) of this section is taken to be the full rate of pay that would be referred to in that paragraph. (9) To avoid doubt, this section does not require that a regulated employee referred to in subsection (5) be taken to be an employee other than a casual employee for the purposes of determining entitlements to kinds of leave, or any other purpose, except determining the protected rate of pay for the regulated employee. Requirement to pay no less than protected rate of pay applies despite other fair work instruments etc. (10) Subsection (2) applies despite any provision of: (a) a fair work instrument (other than an instrument made by the FWC under this Part) that applies to the regulated employee; or (b) a covered employment instrument (other than a fair work instrument) that applies to the regulated employee; or (c) the regulated employee&#39;s contract of employment; that provides for a rate of pay for the regulated employee that is less than the"

Modern awards do not apply to such an employee.Division 4 is about the disclosure of remuneration and other matters relevant to remuneration outcomes. Terms of contracts of employment, and other instruments, that purport to prohibit such disclosures are prohibited.Division 5 is about fixed term contracts.A contract of employment must not include a term that provides the contract will terminate at the end of an identifiable period if: (a) the period is greater than 2 years; or (b) the contract can be renewed so that the employee is employed for more than 2 years; or (c) in certain circumstances, the employee is employed under consecutive contracts.However, such a term may be included in some circumstances, including where a modern award permits the term.The Fair Work Ombudsman must prepare a Fixed Term Contract Information Statement, which must be given to certain current and prospective employees.Division 6 is about generally allowing an employee to refuse contact or attempted contact from their employer (or from a third party where the contact or attempted contact relates to their work) outside the employee&#39;s working hours. The FWC may deal with disputes between an employer and an employee about the right to disconnect, including by making orders to stop an employee from refusing contact or to stop an employer from taking certain actions.Division 7 is about preserving employer-funded paid parental leave if an employee&#39;s child is stillborn or dies. The employee&#39;s employer must not refuse to allow the employee to take that leave, or cancel that leave without a request from the employee. However, this does not apply if the terms and conditions of the employee&#39;s employment make express provision relating to stillbirth or the death of a child."

Determining maximum fine (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the amount is: (a) if the court can determine the underpayment amount for the offence--the greater of 3 times the underpayment amount and whichever of the following applies: (i) for an individual--5,000 penalty units; (ii) for a body corporate--25,000 penalty units; or (b) otherwise--the following amount: (i) for an individual--5,000 penalty units; (ii) for a body corporate--25,000 penalty units. Underpayment amount (7) The underpayment amount for an offence committed by an employer against subsection (1) is the difference between: (a) the required amount mentioned in paragraph (1)(a); and (b) the amount (including a nil amount) the employer actually paid to, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the employee on account of the required amount. Penalty for courses of conduct (8) If: (a) a person is found guilty of committing 2 or more offences (the aggregated offences) against subsection (1); and (b) the aggregated offences arose out of a course of conduct by the person; then, subject to subsections (9) and (10), the person is taken for the purposes of subsections (5) to (7) to have been found guilty of only a single offence. (9) Paragraph (6)(a) applies in relation to the single offence if, and only if, the court can determine the underpayment amount for any of the aggregated offences. (10) The underpayment amount for the single offence is taken to be the sum of each of the underpayment amounts for the aggregated"

Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section  15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.

Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made.

The notes at the end of this compilation (the endnotes) include information about amending laws and the amendment history of provisions of the compiled law. Uncommenced amendments The effect of uncommenced amendments is not shown in the text of the compiled law. The details of amendments made up to, but not commenced at, the compilation date are underlined in the endnotes. Any uncommenced amendments affecting the law are accessible on the Register (www.legislation.gov.au). Application, saving and transitional provisions If the operation of a provision or amendment of the compiled law is affected by an application, saving or transitional provision that is not included in this compilation, details are included in the endnotes. Editorial changes For more information about any editorial changes made in this compilation, see the endnotes. Presentational changes The Legislation Act 2003 provides for First Parliamentary Counsel to make presentational changes to a compilation. Presentational changes are applied to give a more consistent look and feel to legislation published on the Register, and enable the user to more easily navigate those documents. Modifications If the compiled law is modified by another law, the compiled law operates as modified but the modification does not amend the text of the law. Accordingly, this compilation does not show the text of the compiled law as modified. Any modifications affecting the law are accessible on the Register. Self-repealing provisions If a provision of the compiled law has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law, details are included in the endnotes.

The amendment history in endnote 4 provides information about amendments at the provision (generally section or equivalent) level. It also includes information about any provision of the compiled law that has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law. Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section  15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.

The notes at the end of this compilation (the endnotes) include information about amending laws and the amendment history of provisions of the compiled law. Uncommenced amendments The effect of uncommenced amendments is not shown in the text of the compiled law. The details of amendments made up to, but not commenced at, the compilation date are underlined in the endnotes. Any uncommenced amendments affecting the law are accessible on the Register (www.legislation.gov.au). Application, saving and transitional provisions If the operation of a provision or amendment of the compiled law is affected by an application, saving or transitional provision that is not included in this compilation, details are included in the endnotes. Editorial changes For more information about any editorial changes made in this compilation, see the endnotes. Presentational changes The Legislation Act 2003 provides for First Parliamentary Counsel to make presentational changes to a compilation. Presentational changes are applied to give a more consistent look and feel to legislation published on the Register, and enable the user to more easily navigate those documents. Modifications If the compiled law is modified by another law, the compiled law operates as modified but the modification does not amend the text of the law. Accordingly, this compilation does not show the text of the compiled law as modified. Any modifications affecting the law are accessible on the Register. Self-repealing provisions If a provision of the compiled law has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law, details are included in the endnotes.

The amendment history in endnote 4 provides information about amendments at the provision (generally section or equivalent) level. It also includes information about any provision of the compiled law that has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law. Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section  15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and &quot;(md not incorp)&quot; is added to the amendment history.
