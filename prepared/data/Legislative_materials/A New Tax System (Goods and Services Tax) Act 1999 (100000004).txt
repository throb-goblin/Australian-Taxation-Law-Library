Section 1-3 Commonwealth - State financial relations
  The Parliament acknowledges that the Commonwealth:
 (a) will introduce legislation to provide that the revenue from the GST will be granted to the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory; and

Section 2-1 What this Act is about
  This Act is about the GST.
  It begins (in Chapter 2) with the basic rules about the GST, and then sets out in Chapter  3 the exemptions from the GST and in Chapter 4 the special rules that can apply in particular cases.
  It concludes with definitions and other interpretative material.
Note: The GST is imposed by 6 Acts, the most important of which are:
        (a) the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition--General) Act 1999; and
        (b) the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition--Customs) Act 1999; and
        (c) the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition--Excise) Act 1999 .
Section 2-5 The basic rules (Chapter 2)
  Chapter 2 has the basic rules for the GST, including:
 &iuml;&#130;&middot; when and how the GST arises, and who is liable to pay it;
 &iuml;&#130;&middot; when and how input tax credits arise, and who is entitled to them;
 &iuml;&#130;&middot; how to work out payments and refunds of GST;
 &iuml;&#130;&middot; when and how the payments and refunds are to be made.
Section 2-10 The exemptions (Chapter 3)
  Chapter 3 sets out the supplies and importations that are GST -free or input taxed.
Section 2-15 The special rules (Chapter 4)
  Chapter 4 has special rules which, in particular cases, have the effect of modifying the basic rules in Chapter  2.
Note: There is a checklist of special rules at the end of Chapter 2 (in Part  2-8).
Section 2-20 Miscellaneous (Chapter 5)
  Chapter 5 deals with miscellaneous matters.
Section 2-25 Interpretative provisions (Chapter 6)
  Chapter 6 contains the Dictionary, which sets out a list of all the terms that are defined in this Act. It also sets out the meanings of some important concepts and rules on how to interpret this Act.
Section 2-30 Administration, collection and recovery provisions in the Taxation Administration Act 1953
  Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 contains provisions relating to the administration of the GST, and to collection and recovery of amounts of GST.
Section 3-1 When defined terms are identified
 (1) Many of the terms used in the law relating to the GST are defined.
 (2) Most defined terms in this Act are identified by an asterisk appearing at the start of the term: as in &quot; *enterprise&quot;. The footnote that goes with the asterisk contains a signpost to the Dictionary definitions starting at section  195-1.
Section 3-5 When terms are not identified
 (1) Once a defined term has been identified by an asterisk, later occurrences of the term in the same subsection are not usually asterisked.
 (2) Terms are not asterisked in the non-operative material contained in this Act.

Section 3-10 Identifying the defined term in a definition
  Within a definition, the defined term is identified by bold italics.
Section 4-1 Non - operative material
  In addition to the operative provisions themselves, this Act contains other material to help you identify accurately and quickly the provisions that are relevant to you and to help you understand them.
  This other material falls into 2 main categories.
Section 4-5 Explanatory sections
  One category is the explanatory section in many Divisions. Under the section heading &quot;What this Division is about&quot;, a short explanation of the Division appears in boxed text.
  Explanatory sections form part of this Act but are not operative provisions. In interpreting an operative provision, explanatory sections may only be considered for limited purposes. They are set out in section  182-10.
Section 4-10 Other material
  The other category consists of material such as notes and examples. These also form part of the Act. They are distinguished by type size from the operative provisions (except for formulas), but are not kept separate from them.
Section 5-1 What this Chapter is about
This Chapter sets out the basic rules for the GST. In particular, these rules will tell you:&bull;  where liability for GST arises;&bull;  where entitlements to input tax credits arise;&bull;  how the amounts of GST and input tax credits are combined to work out the amount payable by you or to you;&bull;  when and how that amount is to be paid.
Section 5-5 The structure of this Chapter
  The diagram on the next page shows how the basic rules in this Chapter relate to each other. It also shows their relationship with:
 &bull;  the exemptions (Chapter  3)--these provisions exempt from the GST what would otherwise be taxable; and
 &bull;  the special rules (Chapter  4)--these provisions modify the basic rules in particular situations, often in quite limited ways.
Section 7-1 GST and input tax credits
 (1) GST is payable on *taxable supplies and *taxable importations.
 (2) Entitlements to input tax credits arise on *creditable acquisitions and *creditable importations.
For taxable supplies and creditable acquisitions, see Part 2-2.
For taxable importations and creditable importations, see Part 2-3.
Section 7-5 Net amounts
  Amounts of GST and amounts of input tax credits are set off against each other to produce a *net amount for a tax period (which may be altered to take account of *adjustments).
For net amounts (including adjustments to net amounts), see Part 2-4.
Section 7-10 Tax periods
  Every entity that is *registered, or *required to be registered, has tax periods applying to it.
For registration, see Part 2-5.
For tax periods, see Part 2-6.
Section 7-15 Payments and refunds
  The amount *assessed as being the *net amount for a tax period is the amount that the entity must pay to the Commonwealth, or the Commonwealth must refund to the entity, in respect of the period.
For payments and refunds (and GST returns), see Part 2-7.
Note 1: For assessment of net amounts, see Division 155 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.
Note 2: Refunds may be set off against your other liabilities (if any) under laws administered by the Commissioner.
Table of Subdivisions
Section 9-A What are taxable supplies?
Section 9-B Who is liable for GST on taxable supplies?
Section 9-C How much GST is payable on taxable supplies?
Section 9-1 What this Division is about
GST is payable on taxable supplies. This Division defines taxable supplies, states who is liable for the GST, and describes how to work out the GST on supplies.
Section 9-5 Taxable supplies
  You make a taxable supply if:
 (a) you make the supply for *consideration; and
 (b) the supply is made in the course or furtherance of an *enterprise that you *carry on; and
 (c) the supply is *connected with the indirect tax zone; and
 (d) you are *registered, or *required to be registered.
However, the supply is not a *taxable supply to the extent that it is *GST-free or *input taxed.
Section 9-10 Meaning of supply
 (1) A supply is any form of supply whatsoever.
 (2) Without limiting subsection  (1), supply includes any of these:
 (a) a supply of goods;
 (b) a supply of services;
 (c) a provision of advice or information;
 (d) a grant, assignment or surrender of *real property;
 (e) a creation, grant, transfer, assignment or surrender of any right;
 (f) a *financial supply;
 (g) an entry into, or release from, an obligation:
 (i) to do anything; or
 (ii) to refrain from an act; or
 (iii) to tolerate an act or situation;
 (h) any combination of any 2 or more of the matters referred to in paragraphs  (a) to (g).
 (3) It does not matter whether it is lawful to do, to refrain from doing or to tolerate the act or situation constituting the supply.
 (3A) For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of:
 (a) livestock for slaughtering or processing into *food; or
 (b) game for processing into *food;
under an arrangement under which the entity making the delivery only relinquishes title after food has been produced, is the supply of the livestock or game (regardless of when the entity relinquishes title). The supply does not take place on or after the subsequent relinquishment of title.
 (4) However, supply does not include:
 (a) a supply of *money unless the money is provided as *consideration for a supply that is a supply of money or *digital currency; or
 (b) a supply of digital currency unless the digital currency is provided as consideration for a supply that is a supply of digital currency or money.
Section 9-15 Consideration
 (1) Consideration includes:
 (a) any payment, or any act or forbearance, in connection with a supply of anything; and
 (b) any payment, or any act or forbearance, in response to or for the inducement of a supply of anything.
 (2) It does not matter whether the payment, act or forbearance was voluntary, or whether it was by the *recipient of the supply.
 (2A) It does not matter:
 (a) whether the payment, act or forbearance was in compliance with an order of a court, or of a tribunal or other body that has the power to make orders; or
 (b) whether the payment, act or forbearance was in compliance with a settlement relating to proceedings before a court, or before a tribunal or other body that has the power to make orders.
 (2B) For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that the supplier is an entity of which the *recipient of the supply is a member, or that the supplier is an entity that only makes supplies to its members, does not prevent the payment, act or forbearance from being consideration.
Section 9-17 Certain payments and other things not consideration
 (1) If a right or option to acquire a thing is granted, then:
 (a) the consideration for the supply of the thing on the exercise of the right or option is limited to any additional consideration provided either for the supply or in connection with the exercise of the right or option; or
 (b) if there is no such additional consideration--there is no consideration for the supply.
 (2) Making a gift to a non -profit body is not the provision of consideration.
 (3) A payment is not the provision of consideration if:
 (a) the payment is made by a *government related entity to another government related entity for making a supply; and
 (b) the payment is:
 (i) covered by an appropriation under an *Australian law; or
 (ii) made under the National Health Reform Agreement agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments on 2  August 2011, as amended from time to time; or
 (iii) made under another agreement entered into to implement the National Health Reform Agreement; and
 (c) the payment is calculated on the basis that the sum of:
 (i) the payment (including the amounts of any other such payments) relating to the supply; and
 (ii) anything (including any payment for any act or forbearance) that the other government related entity receives from another entity in connection with, or in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply, or for any other related supply;
  does not exceed the supplier&#39;s anticipated or actual costs of making those supplies.
 (4) A payment is not the provision of consideration if the payment is made by a *government related entity to another government related entity and the payment is of a kind specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.
 (5) This section applies despite section  9-15.
Section 9-20 Enterprises
 (1) An enterprise is an activity, or series of activities, done:
 (a) in the form of a *business; or
 (b) in the form of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade; or
 (c) on a regular or continuous basis, in the form of a lease, licence or other grant of an interest in property; or
 (d) by the trustee of a fund that is covered by, or by an authority or institution that is covered by, Subdivision  30-B of the *ITAA 1997 and to which deductible gifts can be made; or
 (da) by a trustee of a *complying superannuation fund or, if there is no trustee of the fund, by a person who manages the fund; or
 (e) by a charity; or
 (g) by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or by a body corporate, or corporation sole, established for a public purpose by or under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or
 (h) by a trustee of a fund covered by item  2 of the table in section 30-15 of the ITAA 1997 or of a fund that would be covered by that item if it had an ABN.
 (2) However, enterprise does not include an activity, or series of activities, done:
 (a) by a person as an employee or in connection with earning *withholding payments covered by subsection (4) (unless the activity or series is done in supplying services as the holder of an office that the person has accepted in the course of or in connection with an activity or series of activities of a kind mentioned in subsection  (1)); or
Note: Acts done as mentioned in paragraph (a) will still form part of the activities of the enterprise to which the person provides work or services.
 (b) as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or
 (c) by an individual (other than a trustee of a charitable fund, or of a fund covered by item  2 of the table in section 30-15 of the ITAA 1997 or of a fund that would be covered by that item if it had an ABN), or a *partnership (all or most of the members of which are individuals), without a reasonable expectation of profit or gain; or
 (d) as a member of a local governing body established by or under a *State law or *Territory law (except a local governing body to which paragraph  12-45(1)(e) in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 applies).
 (3) For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that activities of an entity are limited to making supplies to members of the entity does not prevent those activities:
 (a) being in the form of a *business within the meaning of paragraph (1)(a); or
 (b) being in the form of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade within the meaning of paragraph  (1)(b).
 (4) This subsection covers a *withholding payment covered by any of the provisions in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 listed in the table.
Withholding payments coveredItemProvisionSubject matter1Section 12-35Payment to employee2Section 12-40Payment to company director3Section 12-45Payment to office holder4Section 12-60Payment under labour hire arrangement, or specified by regulations
Section 9-25 Supplies connected with the indirect tax zone
Supplies of goods wholly within the indirect tax zone

 (2) A supply of goods that involves the goods being removed from the indirect tax zone is connected with the indirect tax zone.
Supplies of goods to the indirect tax zone
 (3) A supply of goods that involves the goods being brought to the indirect tax zone is connected with the indirect tax zone if the supplier imports the goods into the indirect tax zone.
 (3A) A supply of goods that is an *offshore supply of low value goods is connected with the indirect tax zone if it is connected with the indirect tax zone under Subdivision  84-C.
Supplies of real property

Supplies of anything else
 (5) A supply of anything other than goods or *real property is connected with the indirect tax zone if:
 (a) the thing is done in the indirect tax zone; or
 (b) the supplier makes the supply through an *enterprise that the supplier *carries on in the indirect tax zone; or
 (c) all of the following apply:
 (i) neither paragraph  (a) nor (b) applies in respect of the thing;
 (ii) the thing is a right or option to acquire another thing;
 (iii) the supply of the other thing would be connected with the indirect tax zone; or

Example: A holiday package for a trip to Queensland that is supplied by a travel operator in Japan will be connected with the indirect tax zone under paragraph  (5)(c).
Note: A supply that is connected with the indirect tax zone under this subsection might be GST-free if it is consumed outside the indirect tax zone: see section  38-190. For more rules about supplies that are GST-free, see Division 38.
Supplies of goods involving installation or assembly services
 (6) If a supply of goods (other than a *luxury car) (the actual supply) involves the goods being brought to the indirect tax zone and the installation or assembly of the goods in the indirect tax zone, then the actual supply is to be treated as if it were 2 separate supplies in the following way:
 (a) the part of the actual supply that involves the installation or assembly of the goods in the indirect tax zone is to be treated as if it were a separate supply of a thing done in the indirect tax zone;
 (b) the remainder of the actual supply is to be treated as if it were a separate supply of goods involving the goods being brought to the indirect tax zone but not involving the installation or assembly of the goods.
Note 1: The paragraph (a) supply is connected with the indirect tax zone (see paragraph  (5)(a)), unless item 1 or 2 of the table in section 9-26 applies.
Note 2: The paragraph (b) supply may be a taxable supply (see subsection  (3)), or there may be a taxable importation of the goods: see Division 13.
Note 3: For the price of the separate supplies, see subsection  9-75(4).
Meaning of Australian consumer
 (7) An entity is an Australian consumer of a supply made to the entity if:
 (a) the entity is an *Australian resident (other than an entity that is an Australian resident solely because the definition of Australia in the *ITAA 1997 includes the external Territories); and
 (b) the entity:
 (i) is not *registered; or
 (ii) if the entity is registered--the entity does not acquire the thing supplied solely or partly for the purpose of an *enterprise that the entity *carries on.
Note: Suppliers must take reasonable steps to ascertain whether recipients are Australian consumers: see section  84-100.
Section 9-26 Supplies by non - residents that are not connected with the indirect tax zone
 (1) A supply is not connected with the indirect tax zone if:
 (a) the supplier is a *non-resident; and

Note: This subsection does not apply to supplies made by a non-resident through a resident agent if they have agreed it is not to apply: see section  57-7.
 (2) An entity is an Australian-based business recipient of a supply made to the entity if:
 (a) the entity is *registered; and
 (b) an *enterprise of the entity is *carried on in the indirect tax zone; and

Supplies that would be both GST-free and input taxed
 (3) To the extent that a supply would, apart from this subsection, be both *GST-free and *input taxed:
 (a) the supply is GST-free and not input taxed, unless the provision under which it is input taxed requires the supplier to have chosen for its supplies of that kind to be input taxed; or
 (b) the supply is input taxed and not GST -free, if that provision requires the supplier to have so chosen.
Note: Subdivisions 40-E (School tuckshops and canteens) and 40 -F (Fund-raising events conducted by charities etc.) require such a choice.)
Supply of things used solely in connection with making supplies that are input taxed but not financial supplies
 (4) A supply is taken to be a supply that is *input taxed if it is a supply of anything (other than *new residential premises) that you have used solely in connection with your supplies that are input taxed but are not *financial supplies.

Section 9-70 The amount of GST on taxable supplies
  The amount of GST on a *taxable supply is 10% of the *value of the taxable supply.
Section 9-75 The value of taxable supplies
 (1) The value of a *taxable supply is as follows:
where:
"price" is the sum of:
 (a) so far as the *consideration for the supply is consideration expressed as an amount of *money--the amount (without any discount for the amount of GST (if any) payable on the supply); and
 (b) so far as the consideration is not consideration expressed as an amount of money--the *GST inclusive market value of that consideration.
Example: You make a taxable supply by selling a car for $22,000 in the course of carrying on an enterprise.
 The value of the supply is:
 The GST on the supply is therefore $2,000 (i.e. 10% of $20,000).
 (2) However, if the taxable supply is of a *luxury car, the value of the taxable supply is as follows:
where:
"luxury car tax value" has the meaning given by section 5-20 of the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 .
 (3) In working out under subsection  (1) the value of a *taxable supply made in a *tax period, being a supply that is a *fringe benefit, the price is taken to be the sum of:
 (a) to the extent that, apart from this subsection, paragraph(a) of the definition of price in subsection (1) would be applicable:
 (i) if the fringe benefit is a car fringe benefit--so much of the amount that would be worked out under that paragraph as represented the *recipient&#39;s payment made in that period; or
 (ii) if the fringe benefit is a benefit other than a car fringe benefit--so much of the amount that would be worked out under that paragraph as represented the *recipients contribution made in that period; and
 (b) to the extent that, apart from this subsection, paragraph(b) of the definition of price in subsection (1) would be applicable:
 (i) if the fringe benefit is a car fringe benefit--so much of the amount that would be worked out under that paragraph as represented the recipient&#39;s payment made in that period; or
 (ii) if the fringe benefit is a benefit other than a car fringe benefit--so much of the amount that would be worked out under that paragraph as represented the recipients contribution made in that period.
 (4) Despite subsection  (1), if a supply of goods (the actual supply) is to be treated as separate supplies because of subsection  9-25(6) or 84-79(2), then the price of each such separate supply is so much of the price of the actual supply, worked out under subsection  (1), as reasonably represents the price of the separate supply.
Section 9-80 The value of taxable supplies that are partly GST - free or input taxed
 (1) If a supply (the actual supply) is:
 (a) partly a *taxable supply; and
 (b) partly a supply that is *GST-free or *input taxed;
the value of the part of the actual supply that is a taxable supply is the proportion of the value of the actual supply that the taxable supply represents.
 (2) The value of the actual supply, for the purposes of subsection  (1), is as follows:
where:
"taxable proportion" is the proportion of the value of the actual supply that represents the value of the *taxable supply (expressed as a number between 0 and 1).
Section 9-85 Value of taxable supplies to be expressed in Australian currency
 (1) For the purposes of this Act, the *value of a *taxable supply is to be expressed in Australian currency.
 (2) In working out the *value of a *taxable supply, any amount of the *consideration for the supply that is expressed in:
 (a) a currency other than Australian currency; or
 (b) *digital currency;
is to be treated as if it were an amount of Australian currency worked out in the manner determined by the Commissioner.
Section 9-90 Rounding of amounts of GST
One taxable supply recorded on an invoice
 (1) If the amount of GST on a *taxable supply that is the only taxable supply recorded on a particular *invoice would, apart from this section, be an amount that includes a fraction of a cent, the amount of GST is rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards).
Several taxable supplies recorded on an invoice
 (2) If 2 or more *taxable supplies are recorded on the same *invoice, the total amount of GST on the supplies is:
 (a) what would be the amount of GST if it were worked out by:
 (i) working out the GST on each of the supplies (without rounding the amounts to the nearest cent); and
 (ii) adding the amounts together and, if the total is an amount that includes a fraction of a cent, rounding it to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards); or
 (b) the amount worked out using the following method statement:
Method statementStep 1. Work out, for each *taxable supply, what would, apart from this section, be the amount of GST on the supply.Step 2. If the amount for the supply has more decimal places than the number of decimal places allowed by the accounting system used to work out the amount, round the amount (up or down as appropriate) to that number of decimal places. Note: Subsection (4) gives further details of this rounding.Step 3. Work out the sum of the amounts worked out under step 1 and (if applicable) step 2 for each supply.Step 4. If the sum under step 3 includes a fraction of a cent, round the sum to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards).
 (3) Whether to use paragraph  (2)(a) or paragraph (2)(b) to work out the total amount of GST on the supplies is a matter of choice for:
 (a) the supplier if the amount is being worked out to ascertain the supplier&#39;s liability for GST; or
 (b) the *recipient of the supplies if the amount is being worked out to ascertain the recipient&#39;s entitlement to input tax credits.
 (4) In applying step 2 of the method statement in subsection  (2), if:
 (a) the number of decimal places in the amount for the supply exceeds by one decimal place the number of decimal places allowed by the accounting system used to work out the amount; and
 (b) the last digit of the amount (before rounding) is 5;
the amount is rounded upwards to that number of decimal places.
Taxable supplies divided into items
 (5) If one or more *taxable supplies recorded on the same *invoice are divided into 2 or more items:
 (a) subsection (1) does not apply; and
 (b) subsection (2) applies as if each such item represented a separate taxable supply.
Taxable supplies recorded on documents other than invoices
 (6) If one or more *taxable supplies, none of which are recorded on an *invoice, are recorded on a document that is not an invoice, this section applies as if the document were an invoice.

 (ba) the amount paid or payable for a supply to which item  5A in the table in subsection 38-355(1) applies, to the extent that the amount:
 (i) is not an amount, the payment of which (or the discharging of a liability to make a payment of which), because of Division  81 or regulations made under that Division, is not the provision of *consideration; and
Note: Division 81 excludes certain taxes, fees and charges from the provision of consideration.
 (ii) is not already included under paragraph  (a) or (b); and
 (c) any *customs duty payable in respect of the importation of the goods; and
 (d) any *wine tax payable in respect of the *local entry of the goods.
 (2A) If an amount to be taken into account under paragraph  (2)(b) or (ba) is not an amount in Australian currency, the amount so taken into account is the equivalent in Australian currency of that amount, ascertained in the way provided in section  161J of the Customs Act 1901.
 (3) The Commissioner may, in writing:
 (a) determine the way in which the amount paid or payable for a specified kind of transport or insurance is to be worked out for the purposes of paragraph  (2)(b); and

 (c) in relation to importations of a specified kind or importations to which specified circumstances apply--determine that:
 (i) the amount paid or payable for a specified kind of transport or insurance is taken, for the purposes of paragraph  (2)(b), to be zero; or
 (ii) the amount paid or payable for a specified kind of supply referred to in paragraph  (2)(ba) is taken, for the purposes of that paragraph, to be zero.
 (4) For a *taxable importation that you make, you may choose to treat the amount under paragraph (2)(b), (or, if paragraph (2)(ba) applies, the sum of the amounts under paragraphs  (2)(b) and (ba)), as an amount equal to:
 (a) the percentage prescribed by the regulations of the *customs value of the goods imported; or
 (b) if no percentage is prescribed--10% of their customs value.
 (5) However, subsection  (4) does not apply if:
 (a) you are not *registered; or
 (b) the *local entry of the goods is a *taxable dealing in relation to *wine; or
 (c) the importation of the goods is a *taxable importation of a luxury car.
Section 13-25 The value of taxable importations that are partly non - taxable importations
  If an importation (the actual importation) is:
 (a) partly a *taxable importation; and
 (b) partly a *non-taxable importation;
the value of the part of the actual importation that is a taxable importation is the proportion of the value of the actual importation (worked out as if it were solely a taxable importation) that the taxable importation represents.

Section 17-1 What this Division is about
A net amount is worked out for each tax period that applies to you.Adjustments can be made to the net amount. Increasing adjustments increase your net amount, and decreasing adjustments decrease your net amount.
Note: GST on taxable importations is not included in the net amount. It is dealt with separately under section  33-15.
Section 17-5 Net amounts
 (1) The net amount for a tax period applying to you is worked out using the following formula:
where:
"GST" is the sum of all of the GST for which you are liable on the *taxable supplies that are attributable to the tax period.
"input tax credits" is the sum of all of the input tax credits to which you are entitled for the *creditable acquisitions and *creditable importations that are attributable to the tax period.
Note 1: For the basic rules on what is attributable to a particular period, see Division 29.
Note 2: For further rules if you have excess GST for the period, see Division 142.
 (2) However, the *net amount for the tax period:
 (a) may be increased or decreased if you have any *adjustments for the tax period; and
 (b) may be increased or decreased under Subdivision  21-A of the *Wine Tax Act; and
 (c) may be increased or decreased under Subdivision  13-A of the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999.

Section 17-10 Adjustments
  If you have any *adjustments that are attributable to a tax period applying to you, alter your *net amount for the period as follows:
 (a) add to the amount worked out under subsection  17-5(1) for the period the sum of all the *increasing adjustments (if any) that are attributable to the period;
 (b) subtract from that amount the sum of all the *decreasing adjustments (if any) that are attributable to the period.
For the basic rules on what adjustments are attributable to a particular period, see Division 29.
Section 17-20 Determinations relating to how to work out net amounts
 (1) The Commissioner may make a determination that, in the circumstances specified in the determination, a *net amount for a tax period may be worked out to take account of other matters in the way specified in the determination.
 (2) The matters must relate to correction of errors that were made in working out *net amounts for tax periods to which subsection (2A) applies.
 (2A) This subsection applies to a *net amount for a tax period (the earlier tax period) if:
 (a) the earlier tax period precedes the tax period mentioned in subsection  (1); and
 (b) the tax period mentioned in subsection  (1) starts during the *period of review for the *assessment of the *net amount.
 (3) If those circumstances apply in relation to a tax period applying to you, you may work out your *net amount for the tax period in that way.

Section 19-A Adjustment events
Section 19-B Adjustments for supplies
Section 19-C Adjustments for acquisitions
Section 19-1 What this Division is about
Adjustments can arise because of adjustment events. They are events such as a cancellation of a supply or acquisition, or a change in the consideration for a supply or acquisition (for example, because of a volume discount).
Note: Importations do not give rise to adjustment events.
Section 19-5 Explanation of the effect of adjustment events
  The following diagram shows how an *adjustment event for a supply or acquisition can give rise to an *increasing adjustment or a *decreasing adjustment.
Note: This section is an explanatory section.
Section 19-10 Adjustment events
 (1) An adjustment event is any event which has the effect of:
 (a) cancelling a supply or acquisition; or
 (b) changing the *consideration for a supply or acquisition; or
 (c) causing a supply or acquisition to become, or stop being, a *taxable supply or *creditable acquisition.
Example: If goods that are supplied for export are not exported within the time provided in section  38-185, the supply is likely to become a taxable supply after originally being a supply that was GST-free.
 (2) Without limiting subsection  (1), these are *adjustment events:
 (a) the return to a supplier of a thing, or part of a thing, supplied (whether or not the return involves a change of ownership of the thing);
 (b) a change to the previously agreed *consideration for a supply or acquisition, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise;
 (c) a change in the extent to which an entity that makes an acquisition provides, or is liable to provide, consideration for the acquisition (unless the entity *accounts on a cash basis).
 (3) An *adjustment event:
 (a) can arise in relation to a supply even if it is not a *taxable supply; and
 (b) can arise in relation to an acquisition even if it is not a *creditable acquisition.
 (4) However, the return of a thing supplied, or part of a thing supplied, to its supplier is not an *adjustment event if the return is for the purpose of repair or maintenance.
Section 19-40 Where adjustments for supplies arise
  You have an adjustment for a supply for which you are liable to pay GST (or would be liable to pay GST if it were a *taxable supply) if:
 (a) in relation to the supply, one or more *adjustment events occur during a tax period; and
 (b) GST on the supply was attributable to an earlier tax period (or, if the supply was not a taxable supply, would have been attributable to an earlier tax period had the supply been a taxable supply); and
 (c) as a result of those adjustment events, the *previously attributed GST amount for the supply (if any) no longer correctly reflects the amount of GST (if any) on the supply (the corrected GST amount), taking into account any change of circumstances that has given rise to an adjustment for the supply under this Subdivision or Division 21 or 134.
Section 19-45 Previously attributed GST amounts
  The previously attributed GST amount for a supply is:
 (a) the amount of any GST that was attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply; plus
 (b) the sum of any *increasing adjustments, under this Subdivision or Division 21, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply; minus
 (c) the sum of any *decreasing adjustments, under this Subdivision or Division 21 or 134, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply.
Section 19-50 Increasing adjustments for supplies
  If the *corrected GST amount is greater than the *previously attributed GST amount, you have an increasing adjustment equal to the difference between the corrected GST amount and the previously attributed GST amount.
Section 19-55 Decreasing adjustments for supplies
  If the *corrected GST amount is less than the *previously attributed GST amount, you have a decreasing adjustment equal to the difference between the previously attributed GST amount and the corrected GST amount.
Section 19-70 Where adjustments for acquisitions arise
 (1) You have an adjustment for an acquisition for which you are entitled to an input tax credit (or would be entitled to an input tax credit if the acquisition were a *creditable acquisition) if:
 (a) in relation to the acquisition, one or more *adjustment events occur during a tax period; and
 (b) an input tax credit on the acquisition was attributable to an earlier tax period (or, if the acquisition was not a creditable acquisition, would have been attributable to an earlier tax period had the acquisition been a creditable acquisition); and
 (c) as a result of those adjustment events, the *previously attributed input tax credit amount for the acquisition (if any) no longer correctly reflects the amount of the input tax credit (if any) on the acquisition (the corrected input tax credit amount).
 (2) In working out the *corrected input tax credit amount for the acquisition:
 (a) take into account any change of circumstances that has given rise to an adjustment for the acquisition under this Subdivision or Division  21, 129, 133 or 134; and
 (b) if an adjustment relating to the acquisition under Division  131 was attributable to an earlier tax period:
 (i) do not take into account that adjustment; and
 (ii) treat the acquisition as one in relation to which Division  131 had not applied.
Section 19-75 Previously attributed input tax credit amounts
  The previously attributed input tax credit amount for an acquisition is:
 (a) the amount of any input tax credit that was attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition; minus
 (b) the sum of any *increasing adjustments, under this Subdivision or Division 21, 129, 131 or 134, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition; plus
 (c) the sum of any *decreasing adjustments, under this Subdivision or Division 21, 129 or 133, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition.
Section 19-80 Increasing adjustments for acquisitions
  If the *previously attributed input tax credit amount is greater than the *corrected input tax credit amount, you have an increasing adjustment equal to the difference between the previously attributed input tax credit amount and the corrected input tax credit amount.
Section 19-85 Decreasing adjustments for acquisitions
  If the *previously attributed input tax credit amount is less than the *corrected input tax credit amount, you have a decreasing adjustment equal to the difference between the corrected input tax credit amount and the previously attributed input tax credit amount.

Section 21-1 What this Division is about
If debts are written off as bad or are outstanding after 12 months, adjustments (for the purpose of working out net amounts) are made. They can arise both for amounts written off or outstanding and for recovery of amounts previously written off or outstanding.

 (a) you made a *taxable supply; and
 (b) the whole or part of the *consideration for the supply has not been received; and
 (c) you write off as bad the whole or a part of the debt, or the whole or a part of the debt has been *overdue for 12 months or more.
The amount of the decreasing adjustment is 1/11 of the amount written off, or 1/11 of the amount that has been overdue for 12 months or more, as the case requires.
 (2) However, you cannot have an *adjustment under this section if you *account on a cash basis.
Section 21-10 Recovering amounts previously written off (taxable supplies)

 (a) you made a *taxable supply in relation to which you had a *decreasing adjustment under section  21-5 for a debt; and
 (b) you recover the whole or a part of the amount written off, or the whole or a part of the amount that has been *overdue for 12 months or more, as the case requires.
The amount of the increasing adjustment is 1/11 of the amount recovered.
Section 21-15 Bad debts written off (creditable acquisitions)
 (1) You have an increasing adjustment if:
 (a) you made a *creditable acquisition for *consideration; and
 (b) the whole or part of the consideration is *overdue, but you have not provided the consideration overdue; and
 (c) the supplier of the thing you acquired writes off as bad the whole or a part of the debt, or the whole or a part of the debt has been overdue for 12 months or more.
The amount of the increasing adjustment is 1/11 of the amount written off, or 1/11 of the amount that has been overdue for 12 months or more, as the case requires.
 (2) However, you cannot have an *adjustment under this section if you *account on a cash basis.
Section 21-20 Recovering amounts previously written off (creditable acquisitions)
  You have a decreasing adjustment if:
 (a) you made a *creditable acquisition in relation to which you had an *increasing adjustment under section  21-15 for a debt; and
 (b) you pay to the supplier of the thing you acquired the whole or a part of the amount written off, or the whole or a part of the amount that has been *overdue for 12 months or more, as the case requires.
The amount of the decreasing adjustment is 1/11 of the amount recovered.

Table of Subdivisions
Section 29-A The attribution rules
Section 29-B Accounting on a cash basis
Section 29-C Tax invoices and adjustment notes
Section 29-1 What this Division is about
This Division tells you the tax periods to which your taxable supplies, creditable acquisitions, creditable importations and adjustments are attributable. You need to know this to work out your net amounts under Part  2-4.
Note: This Division does not deal with your taxable importations, because they are not attributed to tax periods. See section  33-15 for payment of assessed GST on taxable importations.
Section 29-5 Attributing the GST on your taxable supplies
 (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply is attributable to:
 (a) the tax period in which any of the *consideration is received for the supply; or
 (b) if, before any of the consideration is received, an *invoice is issued relating to the supply--the tax period in which the invoice is issued.
 (2) However, if you *account on a cash basis, then:
 (a) if, in a tax period, all of the *consideration is received for a *taxable supply--GST on the supply is attributable to that tax period; or
 (b) if, in a tax period, part of the consideration is received--GST on the supply is attributable to that tax period, but only to the extent that the consideration is received in that tax period; or
 (c) if, in a tax period, none of the consideration is received--none of the GST on the supply is attributable to that tax period.
Section 29-10 Attributing the input tax credits for your creditable acquisitions
 (1) The input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition is attributable to:
 (a) the tax period in which you provide any of the *consideration for the acquisition; or
 (b) if, before you provide any of the consideration, an *invoice is issued relating to the acquisition--the tax period in which the invoice is issued.
 (2) However, if you *account on a cash basis, then:
 (a) if, in a tax period, you provide all of the *consideration for a *creditable acquisition--the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period; or
 (b) if, in a tax period, you provide part of the consideration--the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period, but only to the extent that you provided the consideration in that tax period; or
 (c) if, in a tax period, none of the consideration is provided--none of the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period.
 (3) If you do not hold a *tax invoice for a *creditable acquisition when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the input tax credit (or any part of the input tax credit) on the acquisition would otherwise be attributable:
 (a) the input tax credit (including any part of the input tax credit) is not attributable to that tax period; and
 (b) the input tax credit (or part) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you hold that tax invoice.
However, this subsection does not apply in circumstances of a kind determined in writing by the Commissioner to be circumstances in which the requirement for a tax invoice does not apply.
For the giving of GST returns to the Commissioner, see Division 31.
 (4) If the *GST return for a tax period does not take into account an input tax credit attributable to that tax period:
 (a) the input tax credit is not attributable to that tax period; and
 (b) the input tax credit is attributable to the first tax period for which you give the Commissioner a GST return that does take it into account.
Note: Section 93-5 or 93-15 may provide a time limit on your entitlement to an input tax credit.
Section 29-15 Attributing the input tax credits for your creditable importations
 (1) The input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable importation is attributable to the tax period in which you pay the *assessed GST on the importation.
 (2) However, if paragraph  33-15(1)(b) applies to payment of the *assessed GST on the importation, the input tax credit is attributable to the tax period in which the liability for the GST arose.
Section 29-20 Attributing your adjustments
 (1) An *adjustment that you have is attributable to the tax period in which you become aware of the adjustment.
 (2) However, if you *account on a cash basis, and the *adjustment arises from an *adjustment event as a result of which you are liable to provide *consideration, then:
 (a) if, in a tax period, all of the consideration is provided--the *adjustment is attributable to that tax period; or
 (b) if, in a tax period, part of the consideration is provided--the adjustment is attributable to that tax period, but only to the extent that the consideration is provided in that tax period; or
 (c) if, in a tax period, none of the consideration is provided--none of the adjustment is attributable to that tax period.
 (3) If:
 (a) you have a *decreasing adjustment arising from an *adjustment event; and
 (b) you do not hold an *adjustment note for the adjustment when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the adjustment (or any part of the adjustment) would otherwise be attributable;
then:
 (c) the adjustment (including any part of the adjustment) is not attributable to that tax period; and
 (d) the adjustment (or part) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you hold that adjustment note.
However, this subsection does not apply in circumstances of a kind determined in writing by the Commissioner to be circumstances in which the requirement for an adjustment note does not apply.
For the giving of GST returns to the Commissioner, see Division 31.
Section 29-25 Commissioner may determine particular attribution rules
 (1) The Commissioner may, in writing, determine the tax periods to which:
 (a) GST on *taxable supplies of a specified kind; or
 (b) input tax credits for *creditable acquisitions of a specified kind; or
 (c) input tax credits for *creditable importations of a specified kind; or
 (d) *adjustments of a specified kind;
are attributable.
 (2) However, the Commissioner must not make a determination under this section unless satisfied that it is necessary to prevent the provisions of this Division and Chapter  4 applying in a way that is inappropriate in circumstances involving:
 (a) a supply or acquisition in which possession of goods passes, but title in the goods will, or may, pass at some time in the future; or
 (b) a supply or acquisition for which payment is made or an *invoice is issued, but use, enjoyment or passing of title will, or may, occur at some time in the future; or
 (c) a supply or acquisition occurring, but still being subject to a statutory cooling off period under an *Australian law; or
 (d) a supply or acquisition occurring before the supplier or *recipient knows it has occurred; or
 (e) a supply or acquisition occurring before the supplier or recipient knows the total *consideration; or
 (f) a supply or acquisition made under a contract that is subject to preconditions; or
 (g) a supply or acquisition made under a contract that provides for retention of some or all of the consideration until certain conditions are met; or
 (h) a supply or acquisition for which the GST treatment will be unknown until a later supply is made.
 (3) Determinations under subsection  (1) override the provisions of this Division (except this section) and Chapter 4, but only to the extent of any inconsistency.

Section 33-99 Special rules relating to payments of GST
  Chapter 4 contains special rules relating to payments of GST, as follows:

Section 35-1 What this Division is about
This Division is about the Commissioner&#39;s obligation to pay to you your entitlements to input tax credits that remain after off-setting amounts of GST. The obligation to pay arises for any of your assessed net amounts that are less than zero.
Section 35-5 Entitlement to refund
 (1) If the *assessed net amount for a tax period is less than zero, the Commissioner must, on behalf of the Commonwealth, pay that amount (expressed as a positive amount) to you.
Note 1: See Division 3A of Part IIB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 for the rules about how the Commissioner must pay you. Division 3 of Part IIB allows the Commissioner to apply the amount owing as a credit against tax debts that you owe to the Commonwealth.
Note 2: Interest is payable under the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983 if the Commissioner is late in refunding the amount.
 (2) However, if:
 (a) the Commissioner amends the *assessment of your *net amount; and
 (b) your *assessed net amount before the amendment was less than zero; and
 (c) the amount that, because of the assessment, was:
 (i) paid; or
 (ii) applied under the Taxation Administration Act 1953;
  exceeded the amount (including a nil amount) that would have been payable or applicable had your assessed net amount always been the later assessed net amount;
the amount of the excess is to be treated as if:
 (d) the excess were an assessed net amount for the tax period; and
 (e) that assessed net amount were an amount greater than zero and equal to the amount of the excess; and
 (f) despite Division 33, that assessed net amount became payable, and due for payment, by you at the time when the amount was paid or applied.
Note: Treating the excess as if it were an assessed net amount has the effect of applying the collection and recovery rules in Part  3-10 and Divisions 268 and 269 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 , such as a liability to pay the general interest charge under section 105-80 in that Schedule.
Section 35-10 When entitlement arises
  Your entitlement to be paid an amount under section  35-5 arises when the Commissioner gives you notice of the *assessment of your *net amount for the tax period.
Note: In certain circumstances, the Commissioner is treated as having given you notice of the assessment when you give to the Commissioner your GST return (see section  155-15 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ).
Section 35-99 Special rules relating to refunds

 (4) However, if the notice was given to the Commissioner after the day by which the entity nominated to be the *representative member of the group is required to give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period in which the day specified in the notice occurs, the formation of the *GST group takes effect from the start of:
 (a) the day specified in the notice, if that day is approved by the Commissioner under section  48-71; and
 (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--such other day as the Commissioner approves under that section.

Section 48-40 Who is liable for GST
 (1) GST that is payable on any *taxable supply an entity makes and that is attributable to a tax period during which the entity is a *member of a *GST group:
 (a) is payable by the *representative member; and
 (b) is not payable by the entity that made it (unless the entity is the representative member).
Note: However, each member may be jointly and severally liable to pay the GST that is payable by the representative member (see section  444-90 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (1A) GST that is payable on any *taxable importation an entity makes while the entity is a *member of a *GST group:
 (a) is payable by the *representative member; and
 (b) is not payable by the member that made it (unless the member is the representative member).
Note: However, each member may be jointly and severally liable to pay the GST that is payable by the representative member (see section  444-90 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (2) However:
 (a) a supply that an entity makes to another *member of the same *GST group is treated as if it were not a *taxable supply, unless:
 (i) it is a taxable supply because of section  84-5 (which is about offshore supplies); or
 (ii) the entity is a participant in a *GST joint venture and acquired the thing supplied from the *joint venture operator for the joint venture; and
 (b) this section only applies to GST payable on a *taxable importation made, by a member of the GST group other than the *representative member, if the GST on the importation is payable at a time when GST on *taxable supplies is normally payable by the representative member.
 (3) This section has effect despite sections  9-40 and 13-15 (which are about liability for GST).
Section 48-45 Who is entitled to input tax credits
 (1) If an entity makes a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation the input tax credit for which is attributable to a tax period during which the entity is a *member of a *GST group:
 (a) the *representative member is entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation; and
 (b) the entity making the acquisition or importation is not entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation (unless the entity is the representative member).
 (2) In deciding, for the purposes of subsection  (1), whether an acquisition or importation by an entity is a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation, the acquisition or importation is treated as being solely or partly for a *creditable purpose if, and only if, it would be so treated if:
 (a) the GST group were treated as a single entity; and
 (b) the GST group were not treated as a number of entities corresponding to the members of the GST group.
 (3) However, an acquisition that an entity makes from another *member of the same *GST group is not a *creditable acquisition unless the supply of the thing acquired by the entity was a *taxable supply because of section  84-5 (which is about offshore supplies).
 (4) This section has effect despite sections  11-5 and 15-5 (which are about what are creditable acquisitions and creditable importations), and sections  11-20 and 15-15 (which are about who is entitled to input tax credits).
Section 48-50 Adjustments
 (1) Any *adjustment that an entity has and that is attributable to a tax period during which the entity is a *member of a *GST group is to be treated as if:
 (a) the entity did not have the adjustment (unless the entity is the *representative member); and
 (b) the representative member had the adjustment.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  17-10 (which is about the effect of adjustments on net amounts).
Section 48-51 Consequences of being a member of a GST group for part of a tax period
 (1) If you are a *member of a *GST group only for one or more parts of a tax period:
 (a) section 48-40 does not apply to the GST payable on a *taxable supply that you make, to the extent that the GST would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you; and
 (b) section 48-40 does not apply to the GST payable on a *taxable importation that you make during a period to which subsection (2) applies; and
 (c) section 48-45 does not apply to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation that you make, to the extent that the input tax credit would be attributable to a period to which subsection  (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you; and
 (d) section 48-50 does not apply to an *adjustment that you have that would be attributable to a period to which subsection  (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you.
 (2) This section applies to any period, during the tax period, during which you were not a *member of that *GST group or any other GST group.
Section 48-52 Consequences for a representative member of membership change during a tax period
 (1) If an entity is a *member of a *GST group, of which you are the *representative member, only for one or more parts of a tax period:
 (a) section 48-40 only applies to the GST payable on a *taxable supply that the entity makes, to the extent that the GST would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to the entity; and
 (b) section 48-40 only applies to the GST payable on a *taxable importation that the entity makes during a period to which subsection (2) applies; and
 (c) section 48-45 only applies to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation that the entity makes, to the extent that the input tax credit would be attributable to a period to which subsection  (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to the entity; and
 (d) section 48-50 only applies to an *adjustment that the entity has that would be attributable to a period to which subsection  (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to the entity.
 (2) This section applies to any period, during the tax period, during which the entity was a *member of the *GST group of which you are the *representative member.
 (3) However, if you are the *representative member of the *GST group only for one or more parts of the tax period, this section has effect subject to section  48-53.
 (4) If an entity is a *member of different *GST groups during the same tax period, subsections (1) and (2) apply separately in relation to each of those groups.
Section 48-53 Consequences of changing a representative member during a tax period
 (1) If you are the *representative member of a *GST group only for one or more parts of a tax period, then, in relation to your capacity as the representative member:
 (a) section 48-40 only applies to the GST payable on a *taxable supply that an entity makes, to the extent that the GST would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you; and
 (b) section 48-40 only applies to the GST payable on a *taxable importation that an entity makes during a period to which subsection (2) applies; and
 (c) section 48-45 only applies to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation that an entity makes, to the extent that the input tax credit would be attributable to a period to which subsection  (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you; and
 (d) section 48-50 only applies to an *adjustment that an entity has that would be attributable to a period to which subsection  (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you.
 (2) This section applies to any period, during the tax period, during which you were the *representative member of the *GST group.
Section 48-55 GST groups treated as single entities for certain purposes
 (1) Despite sections  48-45 and 48-50, a *GST group is treated as a single entity, and not as a number of entities corresponding to the *members of the GST group, for the purposes of working out:
 (a) the amounts of any input tax credits to which the *representative member is entitled; and
 (b) whether the representative member has any *adjustments; and
 (c) the amounts of any such adjustments.
 (1A) If:
 (a) while you were not a *member of any *GST group, you acquired or imported a thing; and
 (b) you become a member of a GST group at a time when you still hold the thing;
then, when the *representative member of the GST group applies section 129-40 for the first time after you became a member of the GST group, the *intended or former application of the thing is the extent of *creditable purpose last used to work out:
 (c) the amount of the input tax credit to which you were entitled for the acquisition or importation; or
 (d) the amount of any *adjustment you had under Division 129 in relation to the thing;
as the case requires.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  11-25 (which is about the amount of input tax credits) and section 17-10 (which is about the effect of adjustments on net amounts).
Section 48-57 Tax invoices that are required to identify recipients
 (1) A document issued for a supply is taken to be a tax invoice if:
 (a) it would not, but for this section, be a tax invoice because it does not contain enough information to enable the identity, or the *ABN, of the *recipient of the supply to be clearly ascertained; and
 (b) there is no other reason why it would not be a tax invoice; and
 (c) the *representative member of a *GST group is entitled under section 48-45 to an input tax credit for the *creditable acquisition relating to the supply; and
 (d) the document contains enough information to enable the identity of at least one of the following to be clearly ascertained:
 (i) the GST group;
 (ii) the representative member;
 (iii) another entity that is or was a *member of the GST group, if the representative member would still have been entitled under section 48-45 to that input tax credit if that other entity had been the recipient of the supply.
Note: Subparagraph (d)(iii) ensures that a member of the GST group identified in the document was a member of the group at the relevant time for the supply in question.
 (2) However, any obligation that the supplier of a *taxable supply has under subsection 29-70(2) is an obligation to give to the *recipient of the supply a document that would be a *tax invoice for the supply even if subsection (1) of this section had not been enacted.
Note: This subsection ensures that a recipient&#39;s entitlement to a tax invoice, including (if subparagraph  29-70(1)(c)(ii) requires it) an entitlement to a tax invoice that enables the recipient&#39;s identity or the recipient&#39;s ABN to be clearly ascertained, is unaffected by this section.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  29-70 (which is about tax invoices).
Section 48-60 GST returns
 (1) If you are a *member of a *GST group during the whole of a tax period, you are not required to give to the Commissioner a *GST return for that tax period, unless you are the *representative member of the group during that period.
Note: If you were not a member of a GST group during the whole of a tax period, you are still obliged to give a GST return for the tax period, and (because of section  48-51) your net amount for the tax period will take into account your liabilities and entitlements relating to the one or more parts of the tax period during which you were not a member.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  31-5 (which is about who must give GST returns).
Section 48-70 Changing the membership etc. of GST groups
 (1) The following actions may be taken, in accordance with subsection  (2), in relation to a *GST group:
 (a) the *representative member of the group may, with the written agreement of an entity that *satisfies the membership requirements of the GST group, add the entity to the group;
 (b) the representative member may leave the group; or
 (c) another *member of the group, nominated by the members, who is an *Australian resident may become the new representative member; or
 (d) the representative member may remove from the group any other member of the group; or
 (e) if a member of the group is an *incapacitated entity--the entity&#39;s *representative may remove the entity from the group; or
 (f) the representative member may dissolve the group.
 (2) The action is to be taken by notice given to the Commissioner, in the *approved form, by:
 (a) if paragraph (1)(a), (d) or (f) applies--the *representative member; or
 (b) if paragraph (1)(b) or (c) applies--the new representative member of the group; or
 (c) if paragraph (1)(e) applies--the *representative of the *incapacitated entity.
 (3) The action takes effect from the start of the day specified in the notice (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the notice was given to the Commissioner).
 (4) However, if the notice was given to the Commissioner after the day by which the *representative member of the group, or the entity nominated to be the new representative member of the group, is required to give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period in which the day specified in the notice occurs, the action takes effect from the start of:
 (a) the day specified in the notice, if that day is approved by the Commissioner under section  48-71; and
 (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--such other day as the Commissioner approves under that section.
 (5) Despite subsections  (3) and (4), action taken under paragraph (1)(e) cannot take effect earlier than the day on which the *member of the group became an *incapacitated entity.
 (6) A *GST group is taken to be dissolved if:
 (a) a *member of the group ceases to be the *representative member of the group; and
 (b) no other member of the group becomes the representative member of the group, with effect from the day after the previous representative member ceased to be the representative member of the group.
 (7) A notice that another *member of the *GST group has become the *representative member of the group must be given to the Commissioner within 21 days after the other member became the representative member.
Note: Section 286-75 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 provides an administrative penalty for breach of this subsection.
Section 48-71 Approval of early day of effect of forming, changing etc. GST groups
 (1) If an entity that gives a notice to the Commissioner under paragraph 48-5(1)(c) or subsection  48-70(2) applies, in the *approved form, to the Commissioner for approval of a day specified in the notice, the Commissioner must:
 (a) approve, for the purposes of subsection  48-5(4) or 48-70(4), the day specified in the notice; or
 (b) approve another day for those purposes.
Note: Approving another day under paragraph (b) is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (2) The Commissioner may revoke an approval given under subsection  (1) if the Commissioner is satisfied that the day approved is not appropriate.
Note: Revoking an approval under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (3) The Commissioner must give notice, to the entity referred to in subsection  (1), of any decision that he or she makes under this section.
Section 48-73 Tax periods of GST groups with incapacitated members
 (1) If a *member of a *GST group becomes an *incapacitated entity, the *representative member of that group may, by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form, elect for the tax period that applies at the time to the members of the group to end at the same time as the incapacitated entity&#39;s tax period ends under subsection  27-39(1).
Note 1: Section 31-10 provides for when a GST return must be given to the Commissioner for a tax period other than a quarterly tax period.
Note 2: If the representative member does not make an election under this section when a member of the group becomes an incapacitated entity, the member&#39;s membership of the group may cease if, because of section  27-39, the tax periods applying to it are not the same as those applying to the other members of the group.
 (1A) If an entity ceases to be the *representative member of a *GST group as a result of becoming an *incapacitated entity, the entity may make an election under subsection (1), in relation to becoming an incapacitated entity, as if the entity were still the representative member of the group.
 (1B) A notice under subsection  (1) must be given to the Commissioner within 21 days after the *member becomes an *incapacitated entity.
 (2) If a tax period (the first tax period) ends on a particular day because of subsection (1), the next tax period starts on the day after that day and ends when the first tax period would have ended but for that subsection.
 (3) This section has effect despite Division  27 (which is about how to work out the tax periods that apply).
Section 48-75 Effect of representative member becoming an incapacitated entity
 (1) If:
 (a) the *representative member of a *GST group becomes an *incapacitated entity; and
 (b) the representative member does not cease to be a *member of the group;
the representative member ceases to be the representative member of the group unless all the other *members of the group are incapacitated entities.
 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply for the purposes of the representative member making an election under subsection  48-73(1) relating to the representative member.
 (3) The *representative member of a *GST group ceases to be the representative member of the group if:
 (a) all the *members of the group are *incapacitated entities; and
 (b) a member of the group who is not the representative member ceases to be an incapacitated entity.
Section 48-110 Adjustments after you cease to be a member of a GST group
 (1) If you cease to be a member of a GST group (the first GST group), any *adjustment that arises afterwards in relation to a supply, acquisition or importation that you made while a *member of the first GST group (other than a supply to, or an acquisition from, another member of that group):
 (a) is an adjustment that you have; and
 (b) is not an adjustment of the entity that is or was the *representative member of the first GST group (unless you were that representative member).
 (2) In relation to the first GST group, this section has effect despite section  48-50 (which is about who has adjustments for a GST group).
Section 48-115 Changes in extent of creditable purpose after you cease to be a member of a GST group
 (1) If:
 (a) either:
 (i) while you were a *member of a *GST group (the first GST group), you acquired a thing (other than from another member of that group) or imported a thing; or
 (ii) you acquired or imported a thing while you were not a member of any GST group, and you subsequently became a member of a GST group (the first GST group) while you still held the thing; and
 (b) you cease to be a member of the first GST group;
then, when applying section 129-40 for the first time after that cessation, the *intended or former application of the thing is the extent of *creditable purpose last used to work out:
 (c) the amount of the input tax credit to which you or the *representative member was entitled for the acquisition or importation; or
 (d) the amount of any *adjustment you or the representative member had under Division 129 in relation to the thing.
 (2) If:
 (a) while you were a *member of a *GST group (the first GST group), you acquired a thing (other than from another member of that group) or imported a thing; and
 (b) you have ceased to be a member of the first GST group; and
 (c) you have an *adjustment under Division 129 in relation to the thing, or the *representative member of another GST group of which you are a *member has that adjustment;
then, for the purposes of working out the full input tax credit in section 129-70 or 129-75, you are taken not to have been a member of a GST group when you acquired or imported the thing.

Section 50-5 GST treatment of religious practitioners
  If a *religious practitioner:
 (a) does an activity, or a series of activities:
 (i) in pursuit of his or her vocation as a religious practitioner; and
 (ii) as a member of a religious institution; and

Section 51-C Administrative matters
Section 51-D Ceasing to be a participant in, or an operator of, a GST joint venture
Section 51-1 What this Division is about
Entities engaged in a joint venture can form a GST joint venture. The joint venture operator then deals with the GST liabilities and entitlements arising from the joint venture operator&#39;s dealings on behalf of the participants in the joint venture.
Note: Provisions for participants in GST joint ventures apply for the wine equalisation tax (see Subdivision  21-C of the Wine Tax Act) and the luxury car tax (see Subdivision 16-B of the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 ).
Section 51-5 Formation of GST joint ventures
 (1) Two or more entities may become the *participants in a *GST joint venture if:
 (a) the joint venture is a joint venture for the exploration or exploitation of *mineral deposits, or for a purpose specified in the regulations; and
 (b) the joint venture is not a *partnership; and
 (d) each of those entities *satisfies the participation requirements for that GST joint venture; and
 (e) each of those entities agrees in writing to the *formation of the joint venture as a GST joint venture; and
 (ea) one of those entities, or another entity, is nominated, in that agreement, to be the *joint venture operator of the joint venture; and
 (eb) the nominated joint venture operator notifies the Commissioner, in the *approved form, of the formation of the joint venture as a GST joint venture; and
 (f) if the nominated joint venture operator is not a party to the joint venture agreement--the nominated joint venture operator satisfies the requirements of paragraphs 51 -10(c) and (f).
Such a joint venture is a GST joint venture.
 (2) Not all of the entities that are engaged in, or intend to engage in, the joint venture need to become *participants in the *GST joint venture.
 (3) The *formation of the *GST joint venture takes effect from the start of the day specified in the notice under paragraph  (1)(eb) (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the entities decided to form the joint venture).
 (4) However, if the notice was given to the Commissioner after the day by which the entity nominated to be the *joint venture operator of the *GST joint venture is required to give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period in which the day specified in the notice occurs, the *formation of the GST joint venture takes effect from the start of:
 (a) the day specified in the notice, if that day is approved by the Commissioner under section  51-75; and
 (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--such other day as the Commissioner approves under that section.
Section 51-7 Participants in GST joint ventures

 (2) However, the entity is not a participant in the *GST joint venture if the entity has, since the last time the entity became such a participant:
 (a) left, or been removed from, the joint venture under section  51-70; or
 (b) ceased to *satisfy the participation requirements for the joint venture.
 (3) The *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture must notify the Commissioner, in the *approved form, if a *participant in the joint venture no longer *satisfies the participation requirements for the GST joint venture.
 (4) The notice must be given within 21 days after the *participant no longer *satisfies the participation requirements for the *GST joint venture.
Note: Section 286-75 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 provides an administrative penalty for breach of this subsection.
Section 51-10 Participation requirements of a GST joint venture
  An entity satisfies the participation requirements for a *GST joint venture, or a proposed GST joint venture, if the entity:
 (a) participates in, or intends to participate in, the joint venture; and
 (b) is a party to a joint venture agreement with all the other entities participating in, or intending to participate in, the joint venture; and
 (c) is *registered; and

Section 51-45 Additional net amounts relating to GST joint ventures
 (1) Division 17 applies to the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture as if the joint venture operator had an additional *net amount, relating to the joint venture, for each tax period.
 (2) The additional *net amount relating to the joint venture is worked out as if the joint venture operator:
 (a) is only liable for the GST on *taxable supplies that the joint venture operator makes, on behalf of another entity that is a *participant in the joint venture, in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into; and
 (b) is only entitled to the input tax credits for *creditable acquisitions or *creditable importations that the joint venture operator makes on behalf of another entity that is a participant in the joint venture, in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into; and
 (c) only has adjustments relating to supplies, acquisitions or importations that the joint venture operator makes, on behalf of another entity that is a participant in the joint venture, in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into.
 (2A) However, while an election made by the *joint venture operator under section 51-52 has effect:
 (a) Division 17 applies to the joint venture operator as if the joint venture operator had an additional *net amount, relating to all the *GST joint ventures for which the joint venture operator is the joint venture operator, for each tax period; and
 (b) that additional net amount is worked out by aggregating what would be the additional *net amounts relating to each GST joint venture under subsection (2) if that subsection applied.
 (3) This section has effect despite sections  17-5 and 17-10 (which are about net amounts and adjustments).
Section 51-50 GST returns relating to GST joint ventures
 (1) The *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture must, in relation to each *GST joint venture of the joint venture operator, give to the Commissioner a *GST return for each tax period applying to the joint venture operator.
 (2) However, while an election made by the *joint venture operator under section 51-52 has effect, the joint venture operator must, in relation to all the *GST joint ventures for which the joint venture operator is the joint venture operator, give to the Commissioner a single *GST return for each tax period applying to the joint venture operator.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  31-5 (which is about who must give GST returns).

Disallowance of elections
 (5) The Commissioner may disallow the election if the Commissioner is satisfied that the *joint venture operator has a history of failing to comply with the joint venture operator&#39;s obligations (either as a joint venture operator or in any other capacity) under a *taxation law.
Note: Disallowing an election is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (6) The disallowance is taken to have had effect from the start of the tax period in which the disallowance occurs.
Section 51-55 Payments of GST relating to GST joint ventures
 (1) If the *assessed net amount relating to one or more *GST joint ventures for a tax period is greater than zero:
 (a) the *joint venture operator of that GST joint venture or those GST joint ventures must pay that assessed net amount to the Commissioner; and

 (b) the joint venture operator may:
 (i) if the joint venture operator is a *participant in the joint venture--leave the joint venture; or

 (2) The action takes effect from the start of the day specified in the notice (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the notice was given to the Commissioner).
 (3) However, if the notice was given to the Commissioner after the day by which the *joint venture operator of the joint venture, or the entity nominated to be the new joint venture operator of the joint venture, is required to give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period in which the day specified in the notice occurs, the action takes effect from the start of:

 (d) under section  51-40, the amount of any *adjustment the joint venture operator had under Division 129 in relation to the acquisition or importation.
 (2) If:

 (c) all transfers of anything by the branch to the parent entity (including any other branch of the parent entity), that would have been supplies made by the branch if it were an entity, were supplies made by the separate entity; and
 (d) all transfers of anything by the parent entity (including any other branch of the parent entity) to the branch, that would have been acquisitions made by the branch if it were an entity, were acquisitions made by the separate entity; and
 (e) all adjustments that the branch would have had, if it were an entity, relating to the supplies and acquisitions it would have made as mentioned in paragraphs  (c) and (d), were adjustments that the branch had.

Note: An agreement under paragraph (1)(b) prevents subsection  9-26(1) having the effect that the supply would not be connected with the indirect tax zone (that subsection could otherwise result in the GST on the supply being reverse charged to the recipient under Division  84).
 (2) If the *recipient of the supply is an *Australian-based business recipient, the recipient must be given a notice in the *approved form by:
 (a) if the agreement referred to in paragraph  (1)(b) specifies that the *non-resident is to give the notice--the non-resident; or
 (b) otherwise--the *resident agent.
 (3) The notice must be given no later than 7 days after the earlier of:
 (a) the first day any of the *consideration for the supply is provided; or
 (b) the day on which an *invoice for the supply is issued.

 (4) If the *non-resident and the agent agree in writing to terminate the agreement referred to in paragraph (1)(b), this section ceases to apply:
 (a) if the agreement to terminate specifies a time (not earlier than the start of the day the agreement to terminate is made) as the time the termination takes effect--at that time; or
 (b) otherwise--at the start of the day the agreement to terminate is made.
Section 57-10 Who is entitled to input tax credits
 (1) If a *non-resident makes a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation through a *resident agent:

 (b) the non-resident is not entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation.
 (2) This section has effect despite sections  11-20 and 15-15 (which are about who is entitled to input tax credits).
Section 57-15 Adjustments
 (1) Any *adjustment that a *non-resident has relating to a supply, acquisition or importation made through a *resident agent is to be treated as if:
 (a) the non-resident did not have the adjustment; and
 (b) the agent had the adjustment.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  17-10 (which is about the effect of adjustments on net amounts).

 (2) The Commissioner must notify the *resident agent of the cancellation.
 (3) Sections 25-50 and 25-55 do not apply to the cancellation of the *registration of a *resident agent.
Section 57-30 Notice of cessation of agency
  A *resident agent who ceases to act as agent for a *non-resident must notify the Commissioner of that cessation, in the *approved form, within 14 days after so ceasing to act.
Section 57-35 Tax periods of resident agents
 (1) If you are a *resident agent who is acting as agent for a *non-resident, the Commissioner must determine that the tax periods that apply to you are each individual month if the Commissioner is satisfied that the non-resident&#39;s *GST turnover meets the *tax period turnover threshold.
Note: Determining under this section the tax periods applying to you is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (2) The determination takes effect on the day specified in the determination. However, the day specified must be 1  January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October.
Note: Deciding the date of effect of the determination is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).

Section 57-40 GST returns for non - residents
 (1) A *non-resident is not required to give a *GST return for a tax period if:
 (a) the non-resident&#39;s *net amount for the tax period is zero; or

 (a) the non-resident made *taxable supplies, or supplies that would have been taxable supplies had they not been *GST-free or *input taxed, through you as agent; or
 (b) the non-resident made *creditable acquisitions through you as agent.
Section 57-50 Non - residents that belong to GST groups
  This Division does not apply in relation to a *non-resident that is a *member of a *GST group.
Section 58-1 What this Division is about
This Division sets out how to ascribe activities of a representative of an incapacitated entity between the representative and the incapacitated entity for GST purposes.In particular, supplies, acquisitions and importations, and associated acts and omissions, by the representative are, in most cases, treated as having been by the incapacitated entity. This ensures that a transaction by the representative has the same consequences under the GST law as if the incapacitated entity had no representative.However, in most cases, GST-related liabilities and entitlements are allocated to the representative for transactions that are within the scope of the representative&#39;s responsibility or authority.
Note: This Division does not apply to a representative to the extent that paragraph  105-5(1)(a) (which is about supplies by creditors in satisfaction of debts) will apply to its supplies. See section  58-95.
Section 58-5 General principle for the relationship between incapacitated entities and their representatives
 (1) Subject to this Division, any supply, acquisition or importation by an entity in the capacity of a *representative of another entity that is an *incapacitated entity is taken to be a supply, acquisition or importation by the other entity.
 (2) Subject to this Division, any other act, or any omission, of an entity in the capacity of a *representative of another entity that is an *incapacitated entity is taken to be an act or omission of the other entity, but only for the purposes of determining, for the purposes of the *GST law:
 (a) whether a supply or importation is a *taxable supply or *taxable importation, or the amount of GST payable on the supply or importation; or
 (b) whether an acquisition or importation is a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation, or the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition or importation; or
 (c) whether an *adjustment arises in relation to a supply, acquisition or importation, or the amount of such an adjustment.
 (3) To avoid doubt, if the other entity ceases to be an *incapacitated entity, this section continues to apply in relation to the supply, acquisition or importation, or to the act or omission, after the other entity ceases to be an incapacitated entity.
 (4) To avoid doubt, to the extent that an act or omission referred to in subsection  (2) relates to deciding to *account on a cash basis, that subsection does not apply for the purposes of determining, for the purposes of the *GST law, whether an *adjustment arises under Division 21 in relation to a supply or acquisition.
Section 58-10 Circumstances in which representatives have GST - related liabilities and entitlements
General rule
 (1) A *representative of an *incapacitated entity:
 (a) is liable to pay any GST that the incapacitated entity would, but for this section or section  48-40, be liable to pay on a *taxable supply or a *taxable importation; and
 (b) is entitled to any input tax credit that the incapacitated entity would, but for this section or section  48-45, be entitled to for a *creditable acquisition or a *creditable importation; and
 (c) has any *adjustment that the incapacitated entity would, but for this section or section 48-50, have;
to the extent that the making of the supply, importation or acquisition to which the GST, input tax credit or adjustment relates is within the scope of the representative&#39;s responsibility or authority for managing the incapacitated entity&#39;s affairs.
Exceptions for certain taxable supplies
 (2) This section does not apply to the GST payable on a *taxable supply to the extent that one or more of the following apply:

 (c) if:
 (i) the supply is a supply for which a *voucher to which Division 100 applies is redeemed; and
 (ii) the incapacitated entity supplied the voucher before the representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity;
  the consideration for the supply referred to in subparagraph  (i) does not exceed the consideration provided for the incapacitated entity&#39;s supply of the voucher.
Exception for certain creditable acquisitions

 (a) if the adjustment relates to a supply--the *incapacitated entity received the *consideration for the supply before the *representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity;
 (b) if the adjustment relates to an acquisition--the incapacitated entity provided the consideration for the supply before the representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity;
 (c) the adjustment would not be attributable to a tax period applying to the representative in the capacity of a representative of the incapacitated entity.
Incapacitated entity not liable to pay GST etc.
 (5) An *incapacitated entity or, if the incapacitated entity is a *member of a *GST group, the *representative member of that group:

 (b) is not entitled to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or a *creditable importation to the extent that a representative of the incapacitated entity is entitled under this section to the input tax credit for the acquisition or importation; and
 (c) does not have an *adjustment to the extent that a representative of the incapacitated entity has the adjustment under this section.
Other
 (6) This section has effect despite sections  9-40, 11-20, 13-15, 15-15, 83-5, 84-10 and 86 -5 and subsections 48-40(1) and (1A), 48-45(1) and 48-50(1) (which are about who is liable for GST, and who is entitled to input tax credits).
Section 58-15 Adjustments for bad debts

 (a) the adjustment cannot arise if, when the whole or part of the debt is written off, or has been *overdue for 12 months, the representative *accounts on a cash basis; but
 (b) it does not matter whether the incapacitated entity accounts on a cash basis at that or any other time.
 (2) This section has effect despite subsections  21-5(2) and 21-15(2) (which preclude adjustments for bad debts when accounting on a cash basis).

Section 58-35 Tax periods of representatives
 (1) If a *representative of an *incapacitated entity is *required to be registered in that capacity, the tax periods applying to the representative in that capacity are the same tax periods that apply to the incapacitated entity.
 (2) This section has effect despite Division  27 (which is about how to work out the tax periods that apply).
Section 58-40 Effect on attribution rules of not accounting on a cash basis
 (1) If:
 (a) a *representative of an *incapacitated entity does not *account on a cash basis; and
 (b) because of section  58-10, all or part of the amount of GST payable on a *taxable supply is payable by the representative, or the representative is entitled to all or part of the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition;
then, to the extent that, but for this section, the GST or input tax credit would be attributable to a tax period that ended before the representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity, the GST or input tax credit is instead attributable to the first tax period applying to the representative in that capacity.
 (2) This section has effect despite sections  29-5 and 29-10 (which are about attribution of GST on taxable supplies and of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).
Section 58-45 GST returns for representatives of incapacitated entities

 (2) This section has effect despite section  31-5 (which is about who must give GST returns).
Section 58-50 Representatives to give GST returns for incapacitated entities

 (a) the incapacitated entity has failed to give to the Commissioner a GST return for a tax period; and
 (b) the Commissioner, in writing, directs the representative to give to the Commissioner a GST return.
Note: Deciding to direct a representative of an incapacitated entity to give to the Commissioner a GST return is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (2) The tax period may be any tax period applying to the *incapacitated entity, including:
 (a) a tax period that ends before the *representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity; and

 (b) must be given to the Commissioner within the period specified in the direction.
 (4) Without limiting the matters that the Commissioner may take into account in deciding whether to give a direction under paragraph  (1)(b), the Commissioner must take into account:
 (a) the likelihood of a dividend to unsecured creditors of the *incapacitated entity being declared, and the likely amounts of any such dividend; and
 (b) the likelihood that, if the Commissioner were given the *GST return, it would reveal a liability to pay an amount to the Commissioner under the *GST law; and
 (c) the availability of books and records that would make it possible to prepare the GST return; and
 (d) the likelihood that the cost to the *representative of preparing the GST return would be covered by the incapacitated entity&#39;s assets without resulting in an unreasonable impact on the other creditors of the incapacitated entity.

Note: For example, if the representative:
        (a) is a mortgagee in possession of the entity&#39;s property; and
        (b) is not a representative of the entity for any other reason;
 the representative need not register under section 58-20 if it will supply that property in or towards the satisfaction of a debt owed to it by the entity.
Section 60-1 What this Division is about
This Division enables input tax credits to arise in some circumstances in which acquisitions and importations are made before a company is in existence.
Section 60-5 Input tax credit for acquisitions and importations before establishment
 (1) If you make a *creditable acquisition that is a*pre-establishment acquisition, or a *creditable importation that is a *pre-establishment importation, relating to a *company before it is in existence:
 (a) you are not entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation; and
 (b) once the company is in existence, it is entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation.
 (2) This section has effect despite sections  11-20 and 15-15 (which are about who is entitled to input tax credits).
Section 60-10 Registration etc. not needed for input tax credits
 (1) If you make a *pre-establishment acquisition, the fact that you are not *registered or *required to be registered does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition.
 (2) If you make a *pre-establishment importation, the fact that you are not *registered or *required to be registered does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable importation.
 (3) This section has effect despite sections  11-5 and 15-5 (which are about what are creditable acquisitions and creditable importations).
Section 60-15 Pre - establishment acquisitions and importations
 (1) An acquisition that you make is a pre-establishment acquisition, and an importation that you make is a pre-establishment importation, if:
 (a) you do not *apply the thing acquired or imported for any purpose other than for a *creditable purpose relating to a *company not yet in existence; and
 (b) the company comes into existence, and becomes *registered, within 6 months after the acquisition or importation; and
 (c) you become a member, officer or employee of the company; and
 (d) in the case of an acquisition--you have been fully reimbursed by the company for the *consideration you provided for the acquisition; and
 (e) in the case of an importation--you have been fully reimbursed by the company:
 (i) for the *assessed GST paid on the importation; and
 (ii) for the cost of acquiring or producing the thing imported.
 (2) However, the acquisition or importation is not a pre-establishment acquisition or a pre-establishment importation if:
 (a) you are entitled to an input tax credit for the acquisition or importation; or
 (b) the company acquires the thing acquired or imported, and that acquisition by the company is a *creditable acquisition.
Section 60-20 Creditable purpose
 (1) If, before a *company is in existence, you make an acquisition or importation:
 (a) for the purpose of bringing the company into existence; or
 (b) for the purpose of the company *carrying on an *enterprise after it is in existence;
you acquire or import the thing for a creditable purpose only to the extent that you acquire or import it for either or both of those purposes.
 (2) However, you do not acquire or import the thing for a creditable purpose to the extent that:
 (a) the acquisition or importation relates (directly or indirectly) to the company making supplies that would be *input taxed; or
 (b) the acquisition or importation is of a private or domestic nature.
 (3) An acquisition or importation is not treated, for the purposes of paragraph  (2)(a), as relating to making supplies that would be *input taxed to the extent that the supply is made through an *enterprise, or a part of an enterprise, that the company will *carry on outside the indirect tax zone.
 (4) This section has effect despite sections  11-15 and 15-10 (which are about creditable purpose).
Section 60-25 Attributing the input tax credit for pre - establishment acquisitions
 (1) The input tax credit to which a *company is entitled under this Division for an acquisition that you made is attributable to the tax period (applying to the company) in which you were fully reimbursed by the company for the *consideration you paid for the acquisition.
 (2) However, if the company does not hold a copy of a *tax invoice that you (or your agent) hold for the acquisition when the company gives to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the input tax credit for the acquisition would otherwise be attributable, then:
 (a) the input tax credit (including any part of the input tax credit) is not attributable to that tax period; and
 (b) the input tax credit (or the part of the input tax credit) is attributable to the first tax period for which the company gives to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when it holds a copy of that tax invoice.
However, this subsection does not apply in circumstances of a kind determined in writing by the Commissioner, under subsection  29-10(3), to be circumstances in which the requirement for a tax invoice does not apply.
For the giving of GST returns to the Commissioner, see Division 31.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  29-10 (which is about attributing input tax credits for acquisitions).
Section 60-30 Attributing the input tax credit for pre - establishment importations
 (1) The input tax credit to which a *company is entitled under this Division for an importation that you made is attributable to the tax period (applying to the company) in which you were fully reimbursed by the company:
 (a) for the *assessed GST paid on the importation; and
 (b) for the cost of acquiring or producing the thing imported.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  29-15 (which is about attributing input tax credits for importations).
Section 60-35 Application of Division 129
  If a *company is entitled under this Division to an input tax credit for an acquisition or importation, the acquisition or importation is treated, for the purposes of Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose), as if the company had made it.
Section 63-1 What this Division is about
Some kinds of non-profit entities may choose to have some (or all) of their separately identifiable branches treated as separate entities for GST purposes.
Note: The parent entities then cease to be responsible, for GST purposes, for these branches. (By way of contrast, parent entities would remain responsible for their branches if they registered them under Division  54.)
Section 63-5 Entities that may choose to apply this Division
 (1) An entity may choose to apply this Division.
 (2) However, the entity must be *registered and must be:
 (a) an *endorsed charity or a *government school; or
 (aa) a *gift-deductible entity that is a non-profit body; or
 (b) a non-profit body that is exempt from income tax under any of these provisions of the *ITAA 1997:
 (i) section 50-5 (charity, education and science);
 (ii) section 50-10 (community service);
 (iii) section 50-15 (employees and employers);
 (iv) section 50-40 (primary and secondary resources, and tourism);
 (v) item 9.1 or 9.2 of section  50-45 (sports, culture and recreation).
Section 63-10 Period for which a choice has effect
 (1) The choice has effect from the time the entity makes the choice.
 (2) The choice ceases to have effect if:
 (a) the entity revokes the choice; or
 (b) the entity ceases to meet the requirements of subsection  63-5(2).
 (3) However, the entity:
 (a) cannot revoke the choice within 12 months after the day on which the entity made the choice; and
 (b) cannot make a further choice within 12 months after the day on which the entity revoked a previous choice.
Section 63-15 Consequences of choosing to apply this Division
 (1) While the choice has effect, any branch of the entity is treated, for the purposes of the *GST law (other than sections 63-5 and 63-10 and this section), as an entity if that branch:
 (a) maintains an independent system of accounting; and
 (b) can be separately identified by reference to:
 (i) the nature of the activities carried on through the branch; or
 (ii) the location of the branch; and
 (c) is referred to in the entity&#39;s records to the effect that it is to be treated as a separate entity for the purposes of the GST law.
 (2) The branch&#39;s treatment as an entity ceases if:
 (a) the choice ceases to have effect; or
 (b) the branch ceases to meet the requirements of paragraphs  (1)(a), (b) and (c).
However, if the branch is *registered, its treatment as an entity continues until its registration is cancelled.
 (3) At all times during its treatment as an entity, the branch is a non-profit sub-entity.
Section 63-20 Non - profit sub - entities may register
 (1) A *non-profit sub-entity may apply to be *registered under section  23-10 even if it is not *carrying on an *enterprise and is not intending to carry on an enterprise.
 (2) The Commissioner must *register the *non-profit sub-entity whether or not the Commissioner is satisfied that it is *carrying on an *enterprise or intending to carry on an enterprise.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  23-10 (which is about who may be registered) and section 25-5 (which is about when the Commissioner must register an entity).
Section 63-25 Registration turnover threshold for non - profit sub - entities
 (1) Subsection 23-15(2) applies in relation to a *non-profit sub-entity of an entity (the parent entity) whether or not the parent entity is a non -profit body.
 (2) Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph  23-15(2)(b) may:
 (a) provide that they apply only to *non-profit sub-entities, or only to other non-profit entities; or
 (b) specify one amount for *non-profit sub-entities and a different amount for other non-profit entities.
Section 63-27 Application of particular provisions relating to charities etc.
Application of particular provisions
 (1) For the purposes of the provisions mentioned in subsection  (2), a *non-profit sub-entity of an entity (the parent entity) is taken to be a body of the following type, if the parent entity is a body of that type:
 (a) a non-profit body;
 (b) a *gift-deductible entity;
 (c) a *government school;
 (d) an *endorsed charity;
 (e) a gift-deductible entity endorsed as a deductible gift recipient (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) under section 30-120 of the ITAA 1997;
 (f) a fund, authority or institution of a kind referred to in paragraph  30-125(1)(b) of the ITAA 1997;
 (g) a body that has a particular *gift-deductible purpose;
 (h) a body that operates a particular *retirement village;
 (i) a particular *school.
 (2) The provisions are:
 (a) subsection 9-17(2) (gifts to non-profit bodies not consideration); and
 (b) Subdivision 38-G (Activities of charities etc.); and
 (c) Subdivision 40-E (Schools tuckshops and canteens); and
 (d) Subdivision 40-F (fund-raising events); and
 (e) section 111-18 (reimbursement of volunteers&#39; expenses); and
 (f) section 129-45 (Gifts to gift-deductible entities); and
 (g) Division 157 (Accounting basis of charities etc.).
 (3) To avoid doubt, subsection  (1) does not prevent the *non-profit sub-entity being a body of a particular type merely because the parent entity is not a body of that type.
Section 63-30 When non - profit sub - entities must apply for cancellation of registration
 (1) If a *non-profit sub-entity is *registered and it does not meet the requirements of paragraphs 63 -15(1)(a), (b) and (c), it must apply to the Commissioner in the *approved form for cancellation of its *registration. It must lodge the application within 21 days after the day on which it ceased to meet those requirements.

Note: Cancelling registration under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (2) The Commissioner must notify the sub -entity if the Commissioner decides to cancel its *registration. The notice must specify the date of effect of the cancellation.
 (3) Subsection 25-55(2) (which is about cancelling registration) does not apply to *non-profit sub-entities.
Section 63-40 Effect on adjustments of becoming a non - profit sub - entity
 (1) If a branch of an entity becomes a *non-profit sub-entity, any *adjustment arising afterwards in relation to a supply, acquisition or importation, made by the entity through the branch before it became a non -profit sub-entity:
 (a) is taken to be an adjustment that the non -profit sub-entity has, as if the non-profit sub-entity had made the supply, acquisition or importation; and
 (b) is not taken to be an adjustment that the entity has.
 (2) For the purpose of applying subsection  (1) to an adjustment under Division 129 relating to a thing acquired or imported before the branch became a *non-profit sub-entity, that Division applies as if:
 (a) the extent to which the acquisition or importation of the thing was for a *creditable purpose were the extent to which the non-profit sub-entity acquired or imported it for a creditable purpose; and
 (b) the extent to which the thing has been *applied for a creditable purpose since its acquisition or importation were the extent to which the non-profit sub-entity applied it for a creditable purpose.
Section 63-45 Effect on adjustments of ceasing to be a non - profit sub - entity
 (1) If a branch of an entity ceases to be a *non-profit sub-entity, any *adjustment arising afterwards in relation to a supply, acquisition or importation, made by the branch while it was a non -profit sub-entity, is taken to be an adjustment that the entity has, as if the entity had made the supply, acquisition or importation.
 (2) For the purpose of applying subsection  (1) to an adjustment under Division 129 relating to a thing acquired or imported before the branch ceased to be a *non-profit sub-entity, that Division applies as if:
 (a) the extent to which the acquisition or importation of the thing was for a *creditable purpose were the extent to which the entity acquired or imported it for a creditable purpose; and
 (b) the extent to which the thing has been *applied for a creditable purpose since its acquisition or importation were the extent to which the entity applied it for a creditable purpose.
Section 63-50 Membership requirements of GST groups
  A *non-profit sub-entity satisfies the membership requirements for a *GST group, or a proposed GST group, if:
 (a) it is *registered; and
 (b) it has the same tax periods applying to it as the tax periods applying to all the other members of the GST group or proposed GST group; and
 (c) it accounts on the same basis as all those other members; and
 (d) it is not a *member of any other GST group; and
 (e) each of the other members of the GST group or proposed GST group is either:
 (i) the entity of which the non -profit sub-entity is a branch; or
 (ii) another branch of that entity that is a non -profit sub-entity.
Note: The special rules in this Part mainly modify the operation of Part 2-2, but they may affect other Parts of Chapter  2 in minor ways.

Section 66-B Acquisitions of second-hand goods that are divided for re -supply
Section 66-1 What this Division is about
This Division allows you to claim input tax credits for your acquisitions of second-hand goods, even though GST was not payable on the supply of the goods to you. However, some limitations apply, and a form of global accounting is used for some acquisitions of second -hand goods that are divided for re-supply.
Section 66-5 Creditable acquisitions of second - hand goods
 (1) If you acquire *second-hand goods for the purposes of sale or exchange (but not for manufacture) in the ordinary course of *business, the fact that the supply of the goods to you is not a *taxable supply does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition.
 (2) However, this section does not apply, and is taken never to have applied, to the acquisition if:
 (a) the supply of the goods to you was a *taxable supply, or was *GST-free; or
 (b) you *imported the goods; or
 (c) the supply of the goods to you was a supply by way of hire; or
 (d) Subdivision 66-B applies to the acquisition; or
 (e) you make a supply of the goods that is not a taxable supply.

 (1) The amount of the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition of *second-hand goods for which the *consideration is more than $300 is:
 (a) an amount equal to 1/11 of the *consideration that you provide, or are liable to provide, for the acquisition; or
 (b) if that amount is more than the amount of the GST payable on a *taxable supply of the goods that you make--the amount of GST on that taxable supply.
 (1A) The amount of the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition of *second-hand goods for which the *consideration is $300 or less is an amount equal to 1/11 of the *consideration that you provide, or are liable to provide, for the acquisition.
 (2) However, this section does not apply if the supply of the goods to you is a *taxable supply.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  11-25 (which is about the amount of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).
Section 66-15 Attributing input tax credits for creditable acquisitions of second - hand goods
 (1) If:
 (a) you are entitled, under this Division, to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition of *second-hand goods; and
 (b) either the *consideration for the acquisition was more than $300 or you choose to have this section apply to the acquisition;
the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to:
 (c) the tax period in which any *consideration is received for a subsequent *taxable supply of the goods; or
 (d) if, before any of the consideration is received, you have issued an *invoice relating to the supply--the tax period in which the invoice is issued.
 (2) However, if you *account on a cash basis, then:
 (a) if, in a tax period, all of the *consideration is received for the subsequent *taxable supply--the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period; or
 (b) if, in a tax period, part of the consideration is received--the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period, but only to the extent that the consideration is received in that tax period; or
 (c) if, in a tax period, none of the consideration is received--none of the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period.
 (4) This section has effect despite section  29-10 (which is about attributing the input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).
Section 66-17 Records of creditable acquisitions of second - hand goods
 (1) If you make a *creditable acquisition of second-hand goods and the supply of the goods to you was not a *taxable supply:
 (a) subsection 29-10(3) applies to the acquisition as if references to a *tax invoice were references to a record you prepared that complies with this section; and
 (b) subsection 29-20(3) applies to an adjustment event relating to the acquisition as if references to an *adjustment note were references to a record you prepared that complies with this section.
 (2) To comply with this section, the record must:
 (a) set out the name and address of the entity that supplied the goods to you; and
 (b) describe the goods (including their quantity); and
 (c) set out the date of, and the *consideration for, the acquisition.
 (2A) Subsection 29-10(3) does not apply to a *creditable acquisition of *second-hand goods if:
 (a) the supply to which the acquisition relates is not a *taxable supply; and
 (b) the amount that would have been the *value of the supply (if it had been a *taxable supply) does not exceed $50, or such higher amount as the regulations made for the purposes of subsection  29-80(1) specify.
 (2B) Subsection 29-20(3) does not apply to a *decreasing adjustment relating to a *creditable acquisition of *second-hand goods if:
 (a) the supply to which the acquisition relates is not a *taxable supply; and
 (b) the amount of the adjustment does not exceed $50, or such higher amount as the regulations made for the purposes of subsection  29-80(2) specify.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  29-10 (which is about attributing the input tax credits for creditable acquisitions) and section 29-20 (which is about attributing decreasing adjustments).
Section 66-40 Acquisitions of second - hand goods that can be used to offset GST on future re - supplies
 (1) This Subdivision applies to an acquisition of *second-hand goods if:

 (d) you do not subsequently make a single supply of the entirety of the goods acquired.
 (2) However, this Subdivision does not apply, and is taken never to have applied, to the acquisition if:
 (a) the *consideration for the acquisition separately itemises the consideration for the different goods acquired, and your division of the goods before supplying them:
 (i) corresponds to that itemisation; or
 (ii) does not involve dividing the goods any further than the division indicated by that itemisation; or
 (b) the supply of the goods to you was a *taxable supply, or was *GST-free; or
 (c) you *imported the goods; or
 (d) the supply of the goods to you was a supply by way of hire; or
 (e) you make a supply of the goods, or of part of the goods, that is not a taxable supply (other than because of section  66-45).
Section 66-45 Future re - supplies that are not taxable supplies
 (1) A supply you make is not a *taxable supply if:
 (a) it is a supply of goods that were part of an acquisition you made that was an acquisition of *second-hand goods to which this Subdivision applied; and
 (b) your *total Subdivision 66-B credit amount is more than your *total Subdivision  66-B GST amount; and
 (c) what would be the amount of GST payable on the supply, if the supply were a taxable supply, is less than or equal to the difference between:

Section 66-50 Future re - supplies on which GST is reduced
 (1) The amount of GST on a *taxable supply you make is reduced if:
 (a) it is a supply of goods that were part of an acquisition you made that was an acquisition of *second-hand goods to which this Subdivision applied; and
 (b) your *total Subdivision 66-B credit amount is more than your *total Subdivision  66-B GST amount; and
 (c) what would be the amount of GST payable on the supply, if the amount were not reduced under this section, is more than the difference between:
 (i) your total Subdivision  66-B credit amount; and
 (ii) your total Subdivision  66-B GST amount.
Note: This section will not apply unless the record keeping requirements of section  66-55 are met.
 (2) The amount by which the GST on the supply is reduced is an amount equal to the difference between:
 (a) your *total Subdivision 66-B credit amount; and
 (b) your *total Subdivision 66-B GST amount.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  9-70 (which is about the amount of GST on taxable supplies).

Section 66-60 Input tax credits for acquiring second - hand goods the supply of which is not fully taxable
 (1) If an entity acquires *second-hand goods, and, because of section 66-45 and for no other reason, the supply of the goods to the entity is not a *taxable supply:
 (a) the fact that the supply is not a taxable supply does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition; and
 (b) the amount of the input tax credit for the creditable acquisition is worked out as if the supply were a taxable supply.
 (2) If:
 (a) an entity makes a *creditable acquisition of *second-hand goods; and
 (b) the amount of GST on the supply of the goods to the entity was reduced because of section  66-50;
the amount of the input tax credit for the creditable acquisition is worked out as if that amount of GST had not been so reduced.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  11-5 (which is about what is a creditable acquisition) and section 11-25 (which is about the amount of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).
Section 66-65 Total Subdivision 66 - B credit amounts and Subdivision 66 - B GST amounts
 (1) Your total Subdivision 66-B credit amount is the sum of the amounts of the input tax credits to which you would have been entitled, for all your acquisitions of *second-hand goods to which this Subdivision applied, if this Subdivision had not applied to them.
 (2) Your total Subdivision 66-B GST amount is the sum of:
 (a) all the amounts of GST that, but for the operation of section  66-45, would have been payable on supplies that you made; and
 (b) all the amounts by which GST payable on supplies that you made has been reduced under section  66-50.
Section 66-70 Commissioner may determine rules for applying this Subdivision
 (1) The Commissioner may, in writing, determine:
 (a) that acquisitions of *second-hand goods of a specified kind are, or are not, acquisitions of second-hand goods to which this Subdivision applies; or

Section 69-10 Amounts of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions or creditable importations of certain cars
 (1) If:
 (a) you are entitled to an input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation of a *car; and
 (b) you are not, for the purposes of the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999, entitled to quote an *ABN in relation to the supply to which the creditable acquisition relates, or in relation to the importation, as the case requires; and

 (2) However, if:
 (a) the supply of the car is *GST-free to any extent under Subdivision 38-P; or

Section 69-15 What this Subdivision is about
The GST consequences of incurring certain expenses for the provision of meal entertainment and entertainment facilities depend on elections made under fringe benefits tax law. These elections might not be made until after GST returns are due.This Subdivision allows elections to be made for GST purposes so that GST returns can take into account the likely application of subsection  69-5(3A) to those expenses, before the fringe benefits tax elections are made.
Section 69-20 Effect of elections on net amounts
 (1) If you make an election under this Subdivision that has effect during a particular tax period, your *net amount for the tax period must be worked out on the basis of that election.

Section 69-25 Election to use the 50/50 split method for meal entertainment
  You may elect to have acquisitions or importations treated, for the purposes of this Subdivision, as *non-deductible expenses because of paragraph 69-5(3A)(a), to the extent that the acquisitions or importations would be non -deductible expenses because of that paragraph if:
 (a) an election were in force under section  37AA of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (but no further election were in force under section 37CA of that Act); and

Section 69-45 When elections cease to have effect
  If a circumstance specified in the second column of the following table occurs, the election ceases to have effect from the start of the tax period specified in the third column:

Section 69-50 Adjustment events relating to elections
 (1) The following are adjustment events if they have the effect of changing the extent to which an acquisition you made is a *creditable acquisition:
 (a) an election you make under this Subdivision ceases to have effect at a time other than the start of an *FBT year;
 (b) an election is made under section  37AA, 37CA or 152B of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 for an FBT year, without one or more corresponding elections under this Subdivision having been made covering all the tax periods in that year;
 (c) an election is not made under section 37AA, 37CA or 152B of that Act for an FBT year, but one or more corresponding elections have been made under this Subdivision covering one or more of the tax periods in that year.
 (2) However, an *adjustment event under this section arises only in respect of a tax period in which:
 (a) the day occurs by which you are required, under section  68 of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, to furnish a return to the Commissioner relating to an *FBT year; or
 (b) if you are not required under that section to lodge a return relating to that FBT year--the day occurs by which you would have been required under that section to lodge a return relating to that FBT year, if you were required to lodge the return.
 (3) Subdivision 19-C applies to the acquisition in question as if every *adjustment event under this section that occurred during the *FBT year, and that relates to the acquisition, occurred during the tax period referred to in paragraph  19-70(a).
 (4) This table sets out when elections that you make or fail to make under section  37AA, 37CA or 152B of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 correspond to elections under this Subdivision:

Section 69-55 Adjustment notes not required
  Subsection 29-20(3) does not apply to a *decreasing adjustment arising from an *adjustment event of a kind referred to in section 69-50.
Section 70-1 What this Division is about
In some cases, acquisitions relating to financial supplies can attract a reduced input tax credit, even though no input tax credit could arise under the basic rules.
Section 70-5 Acquisitions that attract the reduced credit
 (1) The regulations may provide that acquisitions of a specified kind that relate to making *financial supplies can give rise to an entitlement to a reduced input tax credit. These are reduced credit acquisitions.
 (1A) However, an acquisition is not a reduced credit acquisition to the extent (if any) that, without this Division applying, an entity is entitled to an input tax credit for the acquisition.
Note: Acquisitions relating to financial supplies can give rise to input tax credits: see subsections  11-15(4) and (5).
 (2) For each kind of *reduced credit acquisition specified, the regulations must specify a percentage to which the input tax credit is reduced.
Section 70-10 Extended meaning of creditable purpose
 (1) The fact that a *reduced credit acquisition relates to making *financial supplies does not stop it being for a *creditable purpose, to the extent that it relates to making financial supplies.
 (2) The fact that you *apply a *reduced credit acquisition in making *financial supplies does not stop it being applied for a *creditable purpose, to the extent that it relates to making financial supplies.
 (3) This section has effect despite sections  11-15 and 129-50 (which are about the meaning of creditable purpose).
Section 70-15 How much are the reduced input tax credits?
 (1) The amount of an input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition of a *reduced credit acquisition is an amount equal to the GST payable on the supply of the acquisition multiplied by the percentage specified under subsection  70-5(2) for acquisitions of that kind.
 (2) However, the amount of such an input tax credit is further reduced if the acquisition is only *partly creditable.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  11-25 (which is about the amount of input tax credits).
Section 70-20 Extent of creditable purpose
 (1) If:
 (a) a *reduced credit acquisition is a *creditable acquisition; and
 (b) it is not wholly for a *creditable purpose because of this Division;
it is *partly creditable.
 (2) The extent to which the acquisition is acquired or applied for a *creditable purpose is worked out using the following formula:
where:
"extent of creditable purpose" is the extent to which the purpose for which you applied or acquired the acquisition was a *creditable purpose otherwise than because of this Division, expressed as a percentage.
"extent of Division 70 creditable purpose" is the extent to which the purpose for which you applied or acquired the acquisition was a *creditable purpose because of this Division, expressed as a percentage.
"percentage credit reduction" is the reduced input tax credit percentage prescribed for the purposes of subsection  70-5(2) for an acquisition of that kind.
Note: This section affects sections 11-30 and 129-40. It is used even if the reduced credit acquisition is used wholly in carrying on your enterprise (unless the acquisition was wholly for a creditable purpose because of this Division, then section  70-15 applies).
Example 1: You make a reduced credit acquisition of $110,000, wholly for the purposes of carrying on your enterprise, partly for the purpose of making financial supplies (40%) and partly for the purpose of making taxable supplies (60%). Assume the percentage credit reduction to be 50%. The extent to which you make the acquisition for a creditable purpose is:
 Applying section 11-30, your input tax credit is $8,000 (assuming you were liable for all the consideration).
Example 2: You subsequently apply the acquisition partly in making financial supplies (40%), partly in making taxable supplies (40%) and partly for private use (20%). The extent to which you made the acquisition for a creditable purpose is:
 Applying Division 129, your input tax credit is reduced to $6,000, giving you an increasing adjustment of $2,000.
 (3) The Commissioner may determine, in writing, one or more ways in which to work out, for the purpose of subsection  (2), the extent to which an acquisition is for a *creditable purpose.
Section 70-25 Sale of reduced credit acquisitions (Division 132)
 (1) If:
 (a) you supply a *reduced credit acquisition in circumstances to which Division 132 applies; and
 (b) you made the acquisition for a *creditable purpose because of this Division, or you applied the acquisition for a *creditable purpose because of this Division;
this section applies for the purposes of Division 132.
 (2) In working out the full input tax credit in subsection  132-5(2), the reference to a *creditable purpose in paragraph (a) of the definition of full input tax credit is to be read as a reference to a *creditable purpose otherwise than because of Division  70.
 (3) In working out the adjusted input tax credit in subsection  132-5(2), the extent of the *creditable purpose because of subsection  132-5(4) is increased by the following extent:
where:
"extent of Division 70 creditable purpose" has the same meaning as in section  70-20.
"percentage credit reduction" has the same meaning as in section 70-20.
Section 71-1 What this Division is about
Suppliers making input taxed supplies may not be entitled to input tax credits for acquisitions or importations they make to provide fringe benefits to their employees.
Note: Under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, a lower rate of fringe benefits tax is payable for providing fringe benefits without entitlement to input tax credits.
Section 71-5 Acquisitions by input taxed suppliers to provide fringe benefits
 (1) An acquisition that solely or partly relates to making supplies that are *input taxed is not a *creditable acquisition if:
 (a) the acquisition would (but for this section) be an acquisition of a kind referred to in paragraph  149A(2)(b) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986; and
 (b) the acquisition specifically relates to the provision of a particular benefit (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of which *fringe benefits tax is or will be payable.
 (2) However, this section does not apply to an acquisition if:
 (a) the only reason it relates to making supplies that are *input taxed is because it relates to making *financial supplies; and
 (b) you do not *exceed the financial acquisitions threshold.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  11-5 (which is about what is a creditable acquisition).
Section 71-10 Importations by input taxed suppliers to provide fringe benefits
 (1) An importation that solely or partly relates to making supplies that are *input taxed is not a *creditable importation if:
 (a) the importation would (but for this section) be an importation of a kind referred to in paragraph  149A(2)(b) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986; and
 (b) the importation specifically relates to the provision of a particular benefit (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of which *fringe benefits tax is or will be payable.
 (2) However, this section does not apply to an importation if:
 (a) the only reason it relates to making supplies that are *input taxed is because it relates to making *financial supplies; and
 (b) you do not *exceed the financial acquisitions threshold.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  15-5 (which is about what is a creditable importation).

Section 72-D Application of this Division to certain sub-entities
Section 72-1 What this Division is about
This Division ensures that supplies to, and acquisitions from, your associates without consideration are brought within the GST system, and that supplies to your associates for inadequate consideration are properly valued for GST purposes.
Section 72-5 Taxable supplies without consideration
 (1) The fact that a supply to your *associate is without *consideration, does not stop the supply being a *taxable supply if:
 (a) your associate is not *registered or *required to be registered; or
 (b) your associate acquires the thing supplied otherwise than solely for a *creditable purpose.
 (2) This section has effect despite paragraphs 9 -5(a) and 84-5(1)(a) (which would otherwise require a taxable supply to be for consideration).
 (3) However, this section does not apply to any supply that is constituted by an insured entity settling a claim under an *insurance policy or by an entity (other than an *operator) settling a claim under a *compulsory third party scheme.
Section 72-10 The value of taxable supplies without consideration
 (1) If a supply to your *associate without *consideration is a *taxable supply, its value is the *GST exclusive market value of the supply.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  9-75 (which is about the value of taxable supplies).
 (3) This section does not apply to a supply that is a *taxable supply because of section 84-5 (which is about offshore supplies).
Section 72-15 Attributing the GST to tax periods
 (1) The tax period to which the GST on a *taxable supply to your *associate without *consideration is attributable is the tax period in which the supply first becomes a supply that is *connected with the indirect tax zone.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  29-5 (which is about attributing GST on taxable supplies).
Section 72-20 Supplies and acquisitions that would otherwise be sales etc.
 (1) If, apart from a lack of *consideration:
 (a) a supply to your *associate from you; or
 (b) a supply to you from your associate;
would be a sale or some other kind of supply, the supply is taken for the purposes of the *GST law to be a supply of that kind.
 (2) If, apart from a lack of *consideration:
 (a) an acquisition by your *associate from you; or
 (b) an acquisition by you from your associate;
would be by sale or some other means, the acquisition is taken for the purposes of the *GST law to be an acquisition by that means.
Section 72-25 Supplies that would otherwise be GST - free, input taxed or financial supplies
  The fact that a supply to or from your *associate is without *consideration does not stop the supply from being any of the following for the purposes of the *GST law:
 (a) a *GST-free supply;
 (b) a supply that is *input taxed;
 (c) a *financial supply.
Section 72-40 Creditable acquisitions without consideration
 (1) The fact that an acquisition from your *associate is without *consideration does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition if you acquire the thing supplied otherwise than solely for a *creditable purpose.
 (2) This section has effect despite paragraph  11-5(c) (which would otherwise require a creditable acquisition to be for consideration).
 (3) However, this section does not apply to any acquisition that is constituted by an insurer settling a claim under an *insurance policy or by an *operator settling a claim under a *compulsory third party scheme.
Section 72-45 The amount of the input tax credit
 (1) The amount of the input tax credit on an acquisition from your *associate that is without *consideration is as follows:
where:
"extent of creditable purpose" is the extent to which the creditable acquisition is for a *creditable purpose, expressed as a percentage of the total purpose of the acquisition.
"full input tax credit" is what would have been the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition if it had been made solely for a creditable purpose and you had provided, or had been liable to provide, all of the consideration for the acquisition.
 (1A) However, if:
 (a) an *annual apportionment election that you have made has effect at the end of the tax period to which the input tax credit is attributable; and
 (b) the acquisition is not an acquisition of a kind specified in the regulations made for the purposes of paragraph  131-40(1)(b);
the amount of the input tax credit on the acquisition is worked out under section 131-40 as if you had provided, or had been liable to provide, all of the *consideration for the acquisition.
 (2) This section has effect despite subsection  11-30(3) (which is about the amount of input tax credits on partly creditable acquisitions).
Section 72-50 Attributing the input tax credit to tax periods
 (1) The tax period to which the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition from your *associate without *consideration is attributable is the tax period in which the supply to which the acquisition relates first becomes a supply that is *connected with the indirect tax zone.

 (b) your associate acquires the thing supplied solely for a *creditable purpose.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  9-75 (which is about the value of taxable supplies).

Section 75-1 What this Division is about
This Division allows you to use a margin scheme to bring within the GST system your taxable supplies of freehold interests in land, of stratum units and of long-term leases.
Section 75-5 Applying the margin scheme
 (1) The *margin scheme applies in working out the amount of GST on a *taxable supply of *real property that you make by:
 (a) selling a freehold interest in land; or
 (b) selling a *stratum unit; or
 (c) granting or selling a *long-term lease;
if you and the *recipient of the supply have agreed in writing that the margin scheme is to apply.
 (1A) The agreement must be made:
 (a) on or before the making of the supply; or
 (b) within such further period as the Commissioner allows.
Note: Refusing to allow, or allowing, a further period within which to make an agreement is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (1B) A supply that you make to your *associate is taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to be a sale to your associate whether or not the supply is for *consideration.
 (2) However, the *margin scheme does not apply if you acquired the entire freehold interest, *stratum unit or *long-term lease through a supply that was *ineligible for the margin scheme.
Note: If you acquired part of the interest, unit or lease through a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme, you may have an increasing adjustment: see section  75-22.
 (3) A supply is ineligible for the margin scheme if:
 (a) it is a *taxable supply on which the GST was worked out without applying the *margin scheme; or
 (b) it is a supply of a thing you acquired by *inheriting it from a deceased person, and the deceased person had acquired all of it through a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme; or
 (c) it is a supply in relation to which all of the following apply:
 (i) you were a *member of a *GST group at the time you acquired the interest, unit or lease in question;
 (ii) the entity from whom you acquired it was a member of the GST group at that time;
 (iii) the last supply of the interest, unit or lease by an entity who was not (at the time of that supply) a member of the GST group to an entity who was (at that time) such a member was a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme; or
 (d) it is a supply in relation to which both of the following apply:
 (i) you acquired the interest, unit or lease from the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture at a time when you were a *participant in the joint venture;
 (ii) the joint venture operator had acquired the interest, unit or lease through a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme; or
 (e) it is a supply in relation to which all of the following apply:
 (i) you acquired the interest, unit or lease from an entity as, or as part of, a *supply of a going concern to you that was *GST-free under Subdivision  38-J;
 (ii) the entity was *registered or *required to be registered, at the time of the acquisition;
 (iii) the entity had acquired the entire interest, unit or lease through a taxable supply on which the GST was worked out without applying the margin scheme; or
 (f) it is a supply in relation to which all of the following apply:
 (i) you acquired the interest, unit or lease from an entity as, or as part of, a supply to you that was GST -free under Subdivision 38-O;
 (ii) the entity was registered or required to be registered, at the time of the acquisition;
 (iii) the entity had acquired the entire interest, unit or lease through a taxable supply on which the GST was worked out without applying the margin scheme; or
 (g) it is a supply in relation to which all of the following apply:
 (i) you acquired the interest, unit or lease from an entity who was your *associate, and who was registered or required to be registered, at the time of the acquisition;
 (ii) the acquisition from your associate was without *consideration;
 (iii) the supply by your associate was not a taxable supply;
 (iv) your associate made the supply in the course or furtherance of an *enterprise that your associate *carried on;
 (v) your associate had acquired the entire interest, unit or lease through a taxable supply on which the GST was worked out without applying the margin scheme.
 (3A) Subparagraphs (3)(g)(iii) and (iv) do not apply if the acquisition from your *associate was not by means of a supply by your associate.
 (4) A reference in paragraph  (3)(b), (c) or (d) to a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme is a reference to a supply:
 (a) that was ineligible for the margin scheme because of one or more previous applications of subsection  (3); or
 (b) that would have been ineligible for the margin scheme for that reason if subsection  (3) had been in force at all relevant times.
Section 75-10 The amount of GST on taxable supplies
 (1) If a *taxable supply of *real property is under the *margin scheme, the amount of GST on the supply is 1/11 of the *margin for the supply.
 (2) Subject to subsection  (3) and section 75-11, the margin for the supply is the amount by which the *consideration for the supply exceeds the consideration for your acquisition of the interest, unit or lease in question.
 (3) Subject to section  75-11, if:
 (a) the circumstances specified in an item in the second column of the table in this subsection apply to the supply; and
 (b) an *approved valuation of the freehold interest, *stratum unit or *long-term lease, as at the day specified in the corresponding item in the third column of the table, has been made;
the margin for the supply is the amount by which the *consideration for the supply exceeds that valuation of the interest, unit or lease.

 (3A) If:
 (a) the circumstances specified in item  4 in the second column of the table in subsection (3) apply to the supply; and
 (b) there are improvements on the land or premises in question on the day on which the *taxable supply takes place;
the valuation is to be made as if there are no improvements on the land or premises on that day.
 (4) This section has effect despite section  9-70 (which is about the amount of GST on taxable supplies).
Note: Section 9-90 (rounding of amounts of GST) can apply to amounts of GST worked out using this section.

  had not been paid in full at the time of the later supply;
treat the amount of the consideration as having been reduced by the amount of unpaid consideration referred to in paragraph (b).
Note: If you subsequently pay more of the consideration for the earlier supply, you may have a decreasing adjustment: see section  75-27.
Section 75-13 Working out margins to take into account supplies to associates
  In working out the *margin for a *taxable supply of *real property you make to an entity who is your *associate at the time of the supply, treat the *consideration for the supply (whether or not the supply was for consideration) as if it were the same as the *GST inclusive market value of the interest, unit or lease at the time of the supply.
Section 75-14 Consideration for acquisition of real property not to include cost of improvements etc.
 (1) To avoid doubt, in working out the *consideration for an acquisition for the purposes of applying the *margin scheme to a *taxable supply of *real property, disregard:
 (a) the cost or value of any other acquisitions that have been made by you, or any work that has been performed, in relation to the real property; and
 (b) the cost or value of any other acquisitions that are intended to be made by you, or any work that is intended to be performed, in relation to the real property after its acquisition;
including acquisitions or work connected with bringing into existence the interest, unit or lease supplied.
 (2) This section does not affect what constitutes *consideration for a purpose not connected with applying the *margin scheme.
Section 75-15 Subdivided real property
 (1) This section applies if you make a *taxable supply of *real property that relates only to part of the land or premises in which you acquired an interest, unit or lease.

 (a) the *consideration for the acquisition or supply referred to in that section of that interest, unit or lease;
 (b) an *approved valuation of that interest, unit or lease as at the day referred to in that section;
 (c) the *GST inclusive market value of that interest, unit or lease as at the day or time referred to in that section.
Example 1: If subsection 75-11(2) applies, use only the corresponding proportion of an approved valuation of your interest, unit or lease in the unsubdivided property as at 1  July 2000.

the margin provision applies, in working out the margin for the supply you make, only to the extent that the supply is connected to the partial acquisition.
 (2) The application of a margin provision in relation to one of the partial acquisitions does not prevent that margin provision or a different margin provision applying in relation to another of the partial acquisitions.
Section 75-20 Supplies under a margin scheme do not give rise to creditable acquisitions
 (1) An acquisition of a freehold interest in land, a *stratum unit or a *long-term lease is not a *creditable acquisition if the supply of the interest, unit or lease was a *taxable supply under the *margin scheme.

Section 78-15 How to work out the decreasing adjustments
No input tax credit for the premium
 (1) If there was no entitlement to an input tax credit for the premium paid in relation to the period during which the event giving rise to the claim happened, the amount of the decreasing adjustment is 1/11 of the *settlement amount.
Partial input tax credit for the premium
 (2) If there was an entitlement to such an input tax credit, the amount of the decreasing adjustment is as follows:
where:
"extent of input tax credit" is the amount of the input tax credit expressed as a fraction of the GST payable for the supply of the *insurance policy for the period to which the premium relates.
Note: There is no decreasing adjustment if there is a full input tax credit for the premium paid: see paragraph  78-10(2)(b).
Non-creditable insurance events
 (3) The amount of the decreasing adjustment under subsection  (1) or (2) is reduced to the extent (if any) that the settlement relates to one or more *non-creditable insurance events.
Settlement amounts
 (4) The settlement amount is worked out using this method statement.
Method statementStep 1. Add together:
 (a) the sum of the payments of *money, or *digital currency, (if any) made in settlement of the claim; and (b) the *GST inclusive market value of the supplies (if any) made by the insurer in settlement of the claim (other than supplies that would have been *taxable supplies but for section 78-25).
Step 2. If any payments of excess were made to the insurer under the *insurance policy in question, subtract from the step 1 amount the sum of all those payments (except to the extent that they are payments of excess to which section  78-18 applies).Step 3. Multiply the step 1 amount, or (if step 2 applies) the step 2 amount, by the following:  where: extent of input tax credit has the meaning given by subsection (2).

 (d) section 78-100 applies as if references in that section to a claim for compensation under a *statutory compensation scheme were references to a claim made to the HIH rescue entity corresponding to a claim for compensation under the scheme.
 (3) This section does not affect the operation of sections  78-10, 78-15 and 78-40.
Section 79-1 What this Division is about
Operators of compulsory third party schemes have adjustments which enable the net GST on the schemes to reflect correctly their margins after settlements of claims and other payments and supplies under the schemes are taken into account.The normal application of Division 78 to some insurance policy payments and supplies under the schemes is modified (see Subdivision  79-A). That Division is also extended so that it applies in a modified form to payments and supplies connected with, but not under, insurance policies (see Subdivision  79-B). For other settlements, and payments, provisions similar to Division 78 apply (see Subdivision  79-C). Certain adjustments are worked out using an &quot;applicable average input tax credit fraction&quot; (see Subdivision  79-D).
Note: Division 80 deals with use of settlement sharing arrangements by the operators of compulsory third party schemes.

Section 79-95 How to work out decreasing adjustments using the applicable average input tax credit fraction
 (1) If an *operator of a *compulsory third party scheme has a *decreasing adjustment in relation to a payment or supply that is to be worked out using the applicable *average input tax credit fraction, the amount of the *decreasing adjustment is as follows.
 (2) The amount is worked out using the formula:
where:
"applicable average input tax credit fraction" is the *average input tax credit fraction for the *compulsory third party scheme concerned for the *financial year in which:
 (a) if the payment or supply is a *CTP compensation payment or supply--the accident or other incident to which the claim relates happened; or
 (b) if the payment or supply is a *CTP ancillary payment or supply--the payment or supply was made; or
 (c) if the payment or supply is a payment or supply to which section  79-15 applies--the accident or other incident to which the claim relates happened.
"payment or supply amount" is the amount worked out in accordance with subsection (3).
Payment or supply amount
 (3) The payment or supply amount mentioned in subsection  (2) is worked out using this method statement.
Method statementStep 1. Add together:
 (a) the sum of the payments of *money, or *digital currency, (if any) that are included in the payment or supply; and (b) the *GST inclusive market value of the supplies (if any) made by the *operator that are included in the payment or supply (other than supplies that would have been *taxable supplies but for section  78-25 or 79-60).
Step 2. If, in relation to the payment or supply, any payments of an excess were made to the *operator, subtract from the step 1 amount the sum of all those payments (except to the extent that they are payments of excess to which section  78-18 or 79-55 applies).Step 3. Except where the payment or supply is a *CTP ancillary payment or supply, multiply the step 1 amount, or (if step 2 applies) the step 2 amount, by the following:  where: applicable average input tax credit fraction has the meaning given by subsection (2).
Reduction for non-creditable insurance events
 (4) The amount of the *decreasing adjustment under subsection (1) is reduced to the extent (if any) that the payment or supply relates to one or more *non-creditable insurance events.
Section 79-100 Meaning of average input tax credit fraction
 (1) Except where subsection  (7) applies, the average input tax credit fraction for a *compulsory third party scheme for a *financial year is:
 (a) if paragraph (b) does not apply--the same fraction as the average input tax credit fraction for the scheme for the preceding financial year; or
 (b) if, under subsection  (3), the Minister determines the average input tax credit fraction for the scheme for the financial year--that fraction.
Note: The average input tax credit fraction for financial years beginning on or before 1 July 2006 was worked out under this section as in force before the commencement of item  146 of Schedule 3 to the Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No.  3) Act 2020.
Minister to use statistical information to determine whether average input tax credit fraction is to be varied
 (3) As soon as practicable after the beginning of each of the following *financial years (a determination year):
 (a) the financial year that begins on 1  July 2006;
 (b) the financial years that begin on each 1  July that occurs 3 years, or a multiple of 3 years, after 1 July 2006;
the Minister must, for each *compulsory third party scheme:
 (c) work out business vehicle use fractions (see subsection  (4)) using each set of statistical information, relating to business and total use of vehicles in the State or Territory in which the scheme operates, published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics during the 3 financial years before the determination year; and
 (d) work out the average of those fractions (the new fraction); and
 (e) if the Minister considers the new fraction is significantly different from the average input tax credit fraction that would, disregarding this subsection, apply under paragraph  (1)(a) for the scheme for the financial year (the operative year) following the determination year--by legislative instrument, determine that the new fraction is to be the average input tax credit fraction for the scheme for the operative year.
Business vehicle use fraction
 (4) The business vehicle use fraction is the fraction of total vehicle use, in the State or Territory in which the *compulsory third party scheme operates, represented by business vehicle use.
Publication of revised statistical information
 (5) To avoid doubt, if, after publishing statistical information relating to business and total use of vehicles in a State or Territory, the Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes a revised or replacement version of that statistical information, that revision or replacement is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section.
Exception
 (7) If:
 (a) this section is being applied in working out the amount of a *decreasing adjustment that arises under section 79-15 (about sole operator elections); and
 (b) the cover under the *insurance policy concerned commenced before 1 July 2003;
the average input tax credit fraction for the *compulsory third party scheme concerned is nil for all *financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2000.

 For the purposes of Division 78 or 79, the payment (except to the extent that it represents a managing operator&#39;s fee) will be treated as being made by the contributing operator under the insurance policy that it issued.
 (3) If the *contributing operator is a party to the *insurance policy settlement sharing arrangement because it issued 2 or more *insurance policies, the *contributing operator&#39;s payment is treated as a payment or supply, made by the contributing operator, in settlement of a claim relating to the accidents or incidents, under the insurance policies, and for that purpose is divided among the policies in equal proportions.

Example: An entity acquires, through a place of business it has overseas, the right to exploit a particular copyright in the indirect tax zone. That right is then transferred to a place of business that the entity has in the indirect tax zone.
 Under this section, the transfer is taken to be a supply that is not connected with the indirect tax zone and, if the other requirements of section  84-5 are satisfied, the transfer is a taxable supply.
 (2) If the transfer is a transfer of the services of an employee, this section does not apply to the transfer to the extent that any payments that:
 (a) are made from the *enterprise in the indirect tax zone to the enterprise outside the indirect tax zone; and
 (b) relate to the transfer;
would be *withholding payments if they were payments from the enterprise in the indirect tax zone to the employee.
Section 84-20 The price of taxable supplies of offshore intangibles without, or for inadequate, consideration
 (1) The price of a supply that is a *taxable supply because of section 84-5 is the *GST inclusive market value of the supply, if:
 (a) the supply is from the *recipient&#39;s *associate; and
 (b) the supply is:
 (i) without *consideration; or
 (ii) for consideration that is less than the GST inclusive market value.
Note: A supply to an associate without consideration may be a taxable supply, see section  72-5.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  9-75 (which is about the price of taxable supplies).
Section 84-25 Tax periods for supplies from associates that are not connected with the indirect tax zone
 (1) This section applies if a supply that is a *taxable supply because of section 84-5 is:
 (a) a supply from the *recipient&#39;s *associate without *consideration; and
 (b) not *connected with the indirect tax zone.
Note: If the supply is connected with the indirect tax zone, see sections 72-15 and 72 -50 for the tax periods.
 (2) The tax period to which the GST on the supply, and the input tax credit on the acquisition, is attributable is the tax period in which the thing supplied starts to be done.
 (3) This section has effect despite:
 (a) sections 29-5 and 72-15 (about attributing GST to tax periods); and
 (b) sections 29-10 and 72-50 (about attributing input tax credits to tax periods).
Section 84-30 Adjustments for acquisitions made solely for a creditable purpose
 (1) This section applies to an acquisition that relates to a supply if the supply would be a *taxable supply under section 84-5 if paragraph  84-5(1A)(b) were disregarded.
 (2) For the purpose of working out whether there is an *adjustment for the acquisition, and the amount of that adjustment, disregard paragraph 84-5(1A)(b).
Note: As a result, the adjustment (including the full input tax credit referred to in sections  129-70 and 129-75) is worked out assuming the supply is taxable and the acquisition fully creditable.
Section 84-45 What this Subdivision is about
Tax invoices and adjustment notes are not required for offshore supplies to Australian consumers.The operator of an electronic distribution platform is treated as having made electronic supplies that are made through the platform: (a) from offshore to Australian consumers; or (b) in some cases, under an agreement with the supplier.The result is that the operator, instead of the suppliers, counts the supplies towards its GST turnover and pays GST on the supplies.
Section 84-50 No tax invoices or adjustment notes for inbound intangible consumer supplies
 (1) You are not required to issue a *tax invoice for a *taxable supply that you make if the supply is solely an *inbound intangible consumer supply.
 (2) You are not required to issue an *adjustment note for an *adjustment event relating to a *taxable supply that you make if the supply is solely an *inbound intangible consumer supply.
 (3) This section has effect despite sections  29-70 and 29-75 (which are about tax invoices and adjustment notes).
Section 84-55 Operator of electronic distribution platform treated as supplier
 (1) If an *inbound intangible consumer supply is made through an *electronic distribution platform, the operator of the platform, instead of the supplier, is treated, for the purposes of the *GST law:
 (a) as being the supplier of, and as making, the supply; and
 (b) as having made the supply for the *consideration for which it was made; and
 (c) as having made the supply in the course or furtherance of an *enterprise that the operator *carries on.
Note: As a consequence, GST on the supply is payable by the operator of the electronic distribution platform.
 (2) Despite subsection  (1), if an *inbound intangible consumer supply is made through more than one *electronic distribution platform, that subsection only applies to the operator of any of those platforms who is:
 (a) *registered and a party to a written agreement, where:
 (i) the agreement is between the operator and at least one of the other operators of the platforms; and
 (ii) the operator is to be treated as the supplier under the agreement; or
 (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--the operator determined in accordance with an instrument made under subsection  (3); or
 (c) if paragraph (a) does not apply and no instrument has been made under subsection  (3):
 (i) the first of the operators of those platforms to receive, or to authorise the charging of, any *consideration for the supply; or
 (ii) if subparagraph  (i) does not apply--the first of the operators of those platforms to authorise the delivery of the supply.
 (3) The Commissioner may, by legislative instrument, specify how an operator is to be determined for the purposes of paragraph  (2)(b).
 (4) Despite subsections  (1) and (2), this section does not apply to an operator of an *electronic distribution platform in relation to an *inbound intangible consumer supply made through the platform if:
 (a) a document, relating to the supply, issued to the *recipient of the supply identifies:
 (i) the supply; and
 (ii) the supplier as the supplier of the supply; and
 (b) the supplier and the operator of the electronic distribution platform have agreed in writing that the supplier is the entity responsible for paying GST for:
 (i) the supply; or
 (ii) a class of supplies that includes the supply; and
 (c) the operator of the electronic distribution platform:
 (i) does not authorise the charge to the recipient for the supply; and
 (ii) does not authorise the delivery of the supply; and
 (iii) does not (whether directly or indirectly) set any of the terms and conditions under which the supply is made.
Section 84-60 Extension of section 84 - 55 to certain other supplies through an electronic distribution platform
 (1) Section 84-55 applies to a supply that is to be made by means of *electronic communication as if it were an *inbound intangible consumer supply if:
 (a) the supply is made through an *electronic distribution platform; and
 (b) the supply is covered by a written agreement entered into between the supplier and the operator of the platform before the supply is made; and
 (c) the operator is *registered; and
 (d) under the agreement, the supply is to be treated as if it were an inbound intangible consumer supply made through the platform.
 (2) However, subsection  (1) does not apply to the supply if:
 (a) the supply is GST-free or input taxed; or
 (b) the operator would not be treated under section  84-55 as being the supplier of, and as making, the supply if it were an *inbound intangible consumer supply.
 (3) If subsection (1) applies to the supply, the supply is treated as having been made in the course or furtherance of the carrying on of the *enterprise through which the operator operates the platform.
Section 84-65 Meaning of inbound intangible consumer supply
 (1) A supply of anything other than goods or *real property is an inbound intangible consumer supply if the *recipient is an *Australian consumer, unless:
 (a) the thing is done wholly in the indirect tax zone; or
 (b) the supplier makes the supply wholly through an *enterprise that the supplier *carries on in the indirect tax zone.
 (2) Disregard section  84-55 in determining whether paragraph (1)(b) applies.
Section 84-70 Meaning of electronic distribution platform
 (1) A service (including a website, internet portal, gateway, store or marketplace) is an electronic distribution platform if:
 (a) the service allows entities to make supplies available to end -users; and
 (b) the service is delivered by means of *electronic communication; and
 (c) any of the supplies that are *inbound intangible consumer supplies are to be made by means of electronic communication.
 (2) However, a service is not an electronic distribution platform solely because it is:
 (a) a carriage service (within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act 1997); or
 (b) a service consisting of one or more of the following:
 (i) providing access to a payment system;
 (ii) processing payments;
 (iii) providing *vouchers the supply of which are not *taxable supplies because of section  100-5.
Section 84-73 What this Subdivision is about
Supplies of low value goods involving goods being brought to the indirect tax zone may be connected with the indirect tax zone.An entity may be treated as the supplier of an offshore supply of low value goods, if the entity is the operator of an electronic distribution platform through which the supply is made, or the entity is a redeliverer of the goods.The result is that the operator or redeliverer, instead of the supplier, counts the supplies towards its GST turnover and pays GST on the supplies.Suppliers of offshore supplies of low value goods are not required to issue tax invoices and adjustment notes, but they must ensure relevant information is included in customs documents.
Note 1: The supplies will need to meet other requirements in order to be taxable supplies: see section  9-5.
Note 2: Offshore supplies of low value goods that are not connected with the indirect tax zone under this Subdivision may be taxable supplies, and &quot;reverse -charged&quot;, under Subdivision 84-A.
Section 84-75 Supplies of low value goods that are connected with the indirect tax zone
 (1) An *offshore supply of low value goods is connected with the indirect tax zone if the *recipient of the supply is a *consumer of the supply.
Note: There is an exception to this rule if the supplier reasonably believes there will be a taxable importation of the goods: see section  84-83.
 (2) An entity is a consumer of a supply made to the entity if:
 (a) the entity is not *registered; or
 (b) if the entity is registered--the entity does not acquire the thing supplied solely or partly for the purpose of an *enterprise that the entity *carries on in the indirect tax zone.
Note: A supplier may treat a recipient as not being a consumer if the supplier reasonably believes (based on certain information) that to be the case: see section  84-105.
 (3) This section has effect in addition to section  9-25 (which is about when supplies are connected with the indirect tax zone).
Section 84-77 Meaning of offshore supply of low value goods
Supplies of low value goods delivered etc. into the indirect tax zone by suppliers
 (1) A *supply of low value goods is an offshore supply of low value goods if:
 (a) the supply involves the goods being brought to the indirect tax zone; and
 (b) the supplier delivers the goods into the indirect tax zone, or procures, arranges or facilitates the delivery of the goods into the indirect tax zone.
Supplies of low value goods made through an electronic distribution platform
 (2) Without limiting subsection  (1), a *supply of low value goods is an offshore supply of low value goods if:
 (a) the supply involves the goods being brought to the indirect tax zone; and
 (b) the supply is made through an *electronic distribution platform; and
 (c) the operator of the platform delivers the goods into the indirect tax zone, or procures, arranges or facilitates the delivery of the goods into the indirect tax zone.
Supplies of low value goods delivered etc. into the indirect tax zone by redeliverers
 (3) A *supply of low value goods is an offshore supply of low value goods if:
 (a) the supply involves the goods being delivered to a place outside the indirect tax zone; and
 (b) a *redeliverer delivers the goods into the indirect tax zone, or procures, arranges or facilitates the delivery of the goods into the indirect tax zone.
 (4) An entity is a redeliverer in relation to a *supply of low value goods if, as a result of an arrangement with the *recipient of the supply (or another entity acting on the recipient&#39;s behalf), the entity, in the course of *carrying on an enterprise:
 (a) delivers the goods into the indirect tax zone, or procures, arranges or facilitates the delivery of the goods into the indirect tax zone; and
  (b) does one or more of the following:
 (i) provides use of an address outside the indirect tax zone to which the goods are delivered;
 (ii) procures, arranges or facilitates use of an address outside the indirect tax zone to which the goods are delivered;
 (iii) purchases the goods;
 (iv) procures, arranges or facilitates purchase of the goods.
 (5) Disregard section  84-81 in applying this section.
Section 84-79 Meaning of supply of low value goods
 (1) A supply of goods is a supply of low value goods if:
 (a) the goods supplied are covered by subsection  (3); or
 (b) the goods supplied include goods covered by subsection  (3).
 (2) However, if the goods supplied include goods that are not covered by subsection (3), then the supply of goods (the actual supply) is to be treated as if it were 2 separate supplies in the following way:
 (a) the part of the actual supply consisting of goods covered by subsection  (3) is to be treated as if it were a separate supply that is a supply of low value goods (regardless of the total *customs value of the goods to which those supplies relate); and
 (b) the remainder of the actual supply is to be treated as if it were a separate supply that is not a supply of low value goods.
Low value goods
 (3) This subsection covers goods if:
 (a) the *customs value of the goods is $1,000 or less; and
 (b) the goods are not tobacco, tobacco products or alcoholic beverages.

 (c) the agreement for the supply was an agreement for the importation and for the exportation; and
 (d) to the extent that working out the value involves an assumption about the way in which the Collector (within the meaning of the Customs Act 1901) will exercise a discretion--the Collector exercised that discretion in a reasonable manner in accordance with law; and
 (e) if an amount to be taken into account in working out that value is not an amount in Australian currency, the amount so taken into account is the equivalent in Australian currency of that amount, ascertained in any of the following ways:
 (i) in the way provided in section  161J of the Customs Act 1901;
 (ii) in the manner determined by the Commissioner under subsection  (5) of this section.
 (5) The Commissioner may, by legislative instrument, determine a manner of ascertaining an amount in Australian currency for the purposes of paragraph  (4)(e).

 (1) This section does not apply to a supply to the extent it is *connected with the indirect tax zone because of a provision of this Act other than this Subdivision.
 (2) This section applies in relation to an *offshore supply of low value goods, regardless of whether the *recipient of the supply is a *consumer.
Note: If the recipient is not a consumer, the entity treated as a supplier by this section must still ensure information is included in customs documents: see section  84-91.
Operator of electronic distribution platform--extension of section 84-55
 (3) Section 84-55 applies to a supply as if it were an *inbound intangible consumer supply if:
 (a) the supply is made through an *electronic distribution platform; and
 (b) the supply is an *offshore supply of low value goods.
Note: Section 84-55 treats the operator of an electronic distribution platform as the supplier of supplies made through the platform.
Redeliverer
 (4) If a supply of goods is an *offshore supply of low value goods solely because of subsection 84-77(3), the *redeliverer is taken, for the purposes of this Act:
 (a) as being the supplier of, and as making, the supply; and
 (b) as having made the supply for the *consideration for which it was made; and
 (c) as having made the supply in the course or furtherance of an *enterprise that the redeliverer *carries on.
 (5) Despite subsection  (4), if there is more than one *redeliverer in relation to the supply, that subsection only applies to the redeliverer who is:
 (a) the first of the redeliverers to enter into an arrangement, with the *recipient, relating to the supply; or
 (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--the first of the redeliverers to enter into an arrangement, with an *associate of the recipient, relating to the supply; or
 (c) if paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply--the first of the redeliverers to enter into an arrangement, of a kind referred to in subsection  84-77(4), relating to the supply; or

 (4) For the purposes of paragraph  (2)(b), the time at which the supplier must have the reasonable belief is:
 (a) if subsection  84-81(4) (about redeliverers treated as suppliers) does not apply--at the most recent time before export that the *consideration for the supply was agreed; or
 (b) if subsection  84-81(4) applies--at the time of delivering the goods into the indirect tax zone, or procuring, arranging or facilitating the delivery of the goods into the indirect tax zone.

Section 84-89 Notifying amounts of GST to recipients of offshore supplies of low value goods
 (1) You must give the *recipient of a supply a notice of the amount of GST (if any) payable in relation to the supply if the supply is a *supplier-taxed offshore supply of low value goods.

Section 84-95 What this Subdivision is about
A supplier is treated in some situations to be making a supply to an entity that is not a consumer, or not an Australian consumer.
Note 1: Whether the recipient of a supply of an intangible is an Australian consumer is one of the tests for whether the supply is connected with the indirect tax zone: see subsection  9-25(5).
Note 2: Whether the recipient of an offshore supply of low value goods is a consumer is one of the tests for whether the supply is connected with the indirect tax zone: see subsection  84-75(1).
Note 3: Supplies affected by this Subdivision may be supplies that are taxable supplies, and reverse charged, under Subdivision  84-A.
Section 84-100 When entities are treated as not being Australian consumers
 (1) The *GST law applies in relation to you as if another entity was not an *Australian consumer of a supply if:
 (a) you take reasonable steps to obtain information about whether or not the other entity is an Australian consumer of the supply; and
 (b) after taking those steps, you reasonably believe that the other entity is not an Australian consumer of the supply.
 (2) Without limiting subsection  (1), the *GST law applies in relation to you as if another entity was not an *Australian consumer of a supply if:
 (a) your usual business systems and processes provide you with a reasonable basis for forming a reasonable belief about whether the other entity is an Australian consumer of the supply; and
 (b) you reasonably believe that the other entity is not an Australian consumer of the supply.
 (3) For the purposes of subsections  (1) and (2), to the extent that your belief that the other entity is not an *Australian consumer of the supply is based on the other entity being *registered, your belief is reasonable only if:
 (a) the other entity&#39;s *ABN, or the other identifying information prescribed under subsection (4) relating to the other entity, has been disclosed to you; and
 (b) the other entity has provided to you a declaration or information that indicates that the other entity is registered.

Section 85-1 What this Division is about
Telecommunication supplies that are effectively used or enjoyed in the indirect tax zone are included in the GST system (regardless of where the supplier has a physical presence).
Section 85-5 When telecommunication supplies are connected with the indirect tax zone
 (1) A *telecommunication supply is connected with the indirect tax zone if the *recipient of the supply will effectively use or enjoy the supply in the indirect tax zone.
 (2) However, subsection  (1) does not apply to a *telecommunication supply, or a telecommunication supply included in a class of telecommunication supplies, if:
 (a) the supplier makes the supply through an *enterprise that is not *carried on in the indirect tax zone; and
 (b) the Commissioner determines that collection of GST on that supply or class of supplies would not be administratively feasible.
 (3) This section has effect in addition to section  9-25 (which is about when supplies are connected with the indirect tax zone), but is subject to section 9-26 (which is about when supplies are not connected with the indirect tax zone).
Section 85-10 Meaning of telecommunication supply
  A telecommunication supply is a supply relating to the transmission, emission or reception of signals, writing, images, sounds or information of any kind by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. It includes:

Section 86-1 What this Division is about
The GST on taxable supplies of goods consisting wholly or partly of valuable metal can be &quot;reverse charged&quot; to the recipients.
Section 86-5 &quot;Reverse charge&quot; on supplies of goods consisting of valuable metal
 (1) The GST on a *taxable supply of goods is payable by the *recipient of the supply, and is not payable by the supplier, if:

 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a *taxable supply of goods if the supply is in a class of supplies determined under subsection (3).
Determination
 (3) For the purposes of subsection  (2), the Commissioner may, by legislative instrument, determine that subsection (1) does not apply to a specified class of supplies.
 (4) In making a determination under subsection  (3), the Commissioner may have regard to the following:
 (a) the likelihood that *recipients and suppliers of that class of supply will otherwise comply with their obligations under the *GST law, and the risk of GST not being paid on *taxable supplies in that class if recipients do not pay the GST;
 (b) the costs for recipients and suppliers of that class of supplies to comply with subsection  (1);
 (c) any other relevant matters.
Effect of this section on other sections
 (5) This section has effect despite sections  9-40 (which is about liability for the GST), 48-40, 51-30 and 83-5 (which are about who is liable for GST).
Section 86-10 The valuable metal threshold
 (1) The market value of goods consisting wholly or partly of *valuable metal exceeds the valuable metal threshold at a time if, at that time:
 (a) unless paragraph (b) applies--the market value of the goods exceeds the market value of the valuable metal in the goods by at least the specified percentage (see subsection  (4)); or
 (b) if the goods consist of goods (separate goods), each of which:
 (i) consist wholly or partly of valuable metal; and
 (ii) can be separately supplied;
  the market value of each of the separate goods exceeds the market value of the valuable metal in those particular separate goods by at least the specified percentage.
Market value of goods and valuable metal
 (2) For the purposes of subsection  (1), the market value of goods or *valuable metal in goods:
 (a) is to be worked out disregarding any amount of GST:
 (i) that is payable on the supply of the goods or metal; or
 (ii) if there is no supply of valuable metal--that would be payable if there were a supply of valuable metal; and
 (b) either:
 (i) unless subparagraph  (ii) applies--is the market value of the goods or metal within the ordinary meaning of the expression; or
 (ii) if the Commissioner has determined under subsection  (3) one or more methods for working out the market value of goods or metal--the market value of the goods or metal worked out using any one of those methods.
 (3) The Commissioner may, by legislative instrument, determine one or more methods of working out the market value of goods or *valuable metal for the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ii).
Specified percentage
 (4) For the purposes of subsection  (1), the specified percentage is:
 (a) if the Minister determines a percentage under subsection  (5)--that percentage; or
 (b) otherwise--10%.
 (5) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine a percentage for the purposes of paragraph  (4)(a).
Effect of section
 (6) To avoid doubt, this section does not affect how goods that consist of goods that can be separately supplied are otherwise treated for the purposes of this Act.
Section 86-15 Recipients who are members of GST groups

 (b) a supply of *real property;
 (c) a *telecommunication supply;

 (3) The part of the actual supply that is not *connected with the indirect tax zone is to be treated as if it were a separate supply that is not connected with the indirect tax zone.
 (4) However, if one of the kinds of supply that forms part of the actual supply may reasonably be regarded as incidental to:
 (a) the other kind of supply that forms part of the actual supply; or
 (b) one (but not both) of the other kinds of supply that form part of the actual supply;

 (d) work out the proportion of that value of the actual supply that the taxable supply represents; and
 (e) multiply that value by the proportion in paragraph  (d).
 (2) If that part of the actual supply is partly a *taxable supply and partly a supply that is *GST-free or *input taxed, this section does not affect the operation of section 9-80 in working out the value of so much of that part of the actual supply as is a taxable supply.

is attributable to the tax period during which the amount was retained or recovered, as the case requires.
 (2) This section has effect despite sections  29-5 and 29-10 (which are about attributing GST for taxable supplies and input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).

Section 111-1 What this Division is about
You may be entitled to input tax credits for some reimbursements you make to employees (or associates of employees), agents, officers or partners for expenses they incur. The entitlement extends to charitable bodies and government schools reimbursing their volunteers.
Section 111-5 Creditable acquisitions relating to reimbursements
 (1) If one or more of the following applies:
 (a) you reimburse an employee or agent for an expense he or she incurs that is related directly to his or her activities as your employee or agent;
 (ab) you reimburse an employee (whether or not you are the employee&#39;s employer) for an expense that the employee or the employee&#39;s *associate incurs, and the reimbursement constitutes an *expense payment benefit;
 (ac) you reimburse an associate of an employee (whether or not you are the employee&#39;s employer) for an expense that the associate or employee incurs, and the reimbursement constitutes an expense payment benefit;
 (b) you are a *company and you reimburse an *officer for an expense he or she incurs that is related directly to his or her activities as your officer;
 (c) you are a *partnership and you reimburse a partner for an expense he or she incurs that is related directly to his or her activities as a partner in the partnership;
the reimbursement is treated as *consideration for an acquisition that you make from the employee, associate, agent, officer or partner.
Note: This section also applies if you reimburse the recipient of certain withholding payments: see section  111-20.
 (2) The fact that the supply to you is not a *taxable supply does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition.
 (3) However, the acquisition is not a *creditable acquisition:
 (a) to the extent (if any) that:
 (i) the employee, *associate, agent, *officer or partner is entitled to an input tax credit for acquiring the thing acquired in incurring the expense; or
 (ii) the acquisition would not, because of Division  69, be a creditable acquisition if you made it; or
 (b) unless the supply of the thing acquired, by the employee, associate, agent, officer or partner in incurring the expense, was a taxable supply; or
 (c) if you would, because of Division  71, not have been entitled to an input tax credit if you had made the acquisition that the employee, associate, agent, officer or partner made.
 (3AA) In working out the extent to which a person is entitled to an input tax credit for the purposes of paragraph  (3)(a), disregard sections 131-40 and 131-50 (which are about amounts of input tax credits under the annual apportionment rules).
 (3A) If you are a *partnership, this section does not apply to your reimbursement of a partner for an expense he or she incurs if, even without this Division applying, you are entitled to an input tax credit arising from the incurring of the expense.
 (4) This section has effect despite section  11-5 (which is about what is a creditable acquisition).
Section 111-10 Amounts of input tax credits relating to reimbursements
 (1) The amount of the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition the *consideration for which is a reimbursement to which section  111-5 applies is an amount equal to 1/11 of the amount of the reimbursement.
 (2) However, if:
 (a) the person incurring the expense incurs it in the capacity of an agent, *officer or partner; and
 (b) the incurring of the expense is only in part related directly to his or her activities as your agent or officer, or as a partner, as the case requires;
the amount of the input tax credit under subsection (1) is reduced by an extent equivalent to the extent to which the incurring of the expense is not related directly to those activities.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  11-25 (which is about the amount of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).
Section 111-15 Tax invoices relating to reimbursements
  For the purposes of subsection  29-10(3), you are taken to hold a *tax invoice for a *creditable acquisition the *consideration for which is a reimbursement to which section  111-5 applies if you hold a tax invoice for the *taxable supply referred to in subsection  111-5(3).
Section 111-18 Application of Division to volunteers working for charities etc.
 (1) If:
 (a) an *endorsed charity, a *gift-deductible entity or a *government school reimburses an individual for an expense he or she incurs; and
 (b) the expense is directly related to his or her activities as a volunteer of the endorsed charity, gift -deductible entity or government school;
this Division applies to the endorsed charity, gift-deductible entity or government school as if:
 (c) the individual were an employee of the endorsed charity, gift -deductible entity or government school; and
 (d) his or her activities in connection with incurring the expense were activities as such an employee.
 (3) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a reimbursement by a *gift-deductible entity endorsed as a deductible gift recipient (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) under section 30-120 of the ITAA 1997, unless:
 (a) the entity is:
 (i) an *endorsed charity; or
 (ii) a *government school; or
 (iii) a fund, authority or institution of a kind referred to in paragraph  30-125(1)(b) of the ITAA 1997; or
 (b) each purpose to which the expense relates is a *gift-deductible purpose of the entity.
Note: This subsection excludes from this section reimbursements by certain (but not all) gift-deductible entities that are only endorsed for the operation of a fund, authority or institution. However, reimbursements can be covered by this section if they relate to the principal purpose of the fund, authority or institution.
Section 111-20 Application of Division to recipients of certain withholding payments
 (1) If you make, or are liable to make, *withholding payments covered by subsection (2), this Division applies to you as if:
 (a) an individual to whom you make (or are liable to make) such payments were your employee; and
 (b) his or her activities in connection with earning such payments were activities as your employee.
 (2) This subsection covers a *withholding payment covered by any of the provisions in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 listed in the table.

 (ii) on behalf of an associate of an employee (whether or not you are the employee&#39;s employer) for an expense that the associate or employee incurs;
  that constitutes an *expense payment benefit;
this Division applies to you as if you reimbursed your employee, or you reimbursed the employee or associate, for the expense.
Section 111-30 Reimbursements etc. of former or future employees etc.
  This Division applies in relation to:
 (a) reimbursements, of a kind referred to in paragraph  111-5(1)(ab) or (ac), of former employees and future employees, and of the *associates of former employees and future employees; and
 (b) payments, of a kind referred to in paragraph  111-25(b), that you make or are liable to make on behalf of former employees and future employees, and of the *associates of former employees and future employees;
in the same way that this Division applies to such reimbursements of, and such payments that you make or are liable to make to, employees and their associates.
Section 113-1 What this Division is about

 (a) an amount must be withheld from payment for the supply because of section 12-55 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (about voluntary agreements to withhold); and (b) the acquisition of the thing supplied would be a creditable acquisition if the supply were a taxable supply.
Section 113-5 Supply of work or services not a taxable supply
 (1) A supply that you make is not a *taxable supply to the extent that you make it under an arrangement (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) if:
 (a) the arrangement the performance of which, in whole or in part, involves the performance of work or services (whether or not by you); and
 (b) an agreement is in force that:
 (i) complies with section  12-55 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (about voluntary agreements to withhold); and
 (ii) states that the section covers payments under the arrangement, or payments under a series of arrangements that includes the arrangement; and
 (c) you, and the entity acquiring what you supply under the arrangement, are parties to that agreement; and
 (d) you have an *ABN that is in force and is quoted in the agreement; and
 (e) the acquisition, by that entity, of what you supply under the arrangement would be a *creditable acquisition (and not *partly creditable) if the supply were a *taxable supply.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  9-5 (about what is a taxable supply.)
Note: The special rules in this Part mainly modify the operation of Part 2-3, but they may affect other Parts of Chapter  2 in minor ways.
Section 114-1 What this Division is about
This Division treats as taxable importations several kinds of importations of goods covered by the Customs Act 1901, even though the goods are not entered for home consumption.

Section 117-1 What this Division is about
Taxable importations of goods that were exported, and then re-imported, are in some cases given a lower value than would otherwise apply. The GST then applies only to the lower value, and not to the entire value, of the goods.
Section 117-5 Valuation of taxable importations of goods that were exported for repair or renovation
 (1) The value of a *taxable importation of goods that were exported from the indirect tax zone for repair or renovation, or that are part of a *batch repair process, is the sum of:

 (b) the amount paid or payable:
 (i) for the *international transport of the goods to their *place of consignment in the indirect tax zone; and
 (ii) to insure the goods for that transport;
  to the extent that the amount is not already included under paragraph  (a); and
 (ba) the amount paid or payable for a supply to which item  5A in the table in subsection 38-355(1) applies, to the extent that the amount:
 (i) is not an amount, the payment of which (or the discharging of a liability to make a payment of which), because of Division  81 or regulations made under that Division, is not the provision of *consideration; and

Section 126-1 What this Division is about
Gambling is dealt with under the GST by using a global accounting system that provides for an alternative way of working out your net amounts by incorporating your net profits from taxable supplies involving gambling.

 (1) If you are liable for the GST on a *gambling supply, your net amount for the tax period to which the GST on the supply is attributable is as follows:
where:
"global GST amount" is your *global GST amount for the tax period.
"input tax credits" is the sum of all of the input tax credits to which you are entitled on the *creditable acquisitions and *creditable importations that are attributable to the tax period.
Note: Any supplies under the global accounting system will not have attracted input tax credits.
"other GST" is the sum of all of the GST for which you are liable on the *taxable supplies that are attributable to the tax period, other than *gambling supplies.
For the basic rules on what is attributable to a particular period, see Division 29.
 (2) However, the *net amount worked out under subsection (1) for the tax period:
 (a) may be increased or decreased if you have any *adjustments for the tax period; and
 (b) may be increased or decreased under Subdivision  21-A of the *Wine Tax Act; and

Section 126-10 Global GST amounts
 (1) Your global GST amount for a tax period is as follows:
where:
"total amounts wagered" is the sum of the *consideration for all of your *gambling supplies that are attributable to that tax period.
"total monetary prizes" is the sum of:
 (a) the *monetary prizes you are liable to pay, during the tax period, on the outcome of gambling events (whether or not any of those gambling events, or the *gambling supplies to which the monetary prizes relate, take place during the tax period); and
 (b) any amounts of *money or *digital currency you are liable to pay, during the tax period, under agreements between you and *recipients of your gambling supplies, to repay to them a proportion of their losses relating to those supplies (whether or not the supplies take place during the tax period).
For the basic rules on what is attributable to a particular period, see Division 29.
 (2) However, your global GST amount is zero for any tax period in which total monetary prizes exceeds total amounts wagered.
 (3) In working out the total monetary prizes for a tax period, disregard any *monetary prizes you are liable to pay, during the tax period, that relate to supplies that are *GST-free.
 (4) Your global GST amount for a tax period may be affected by sections 126-15 and 126-20.
Section 126-15 Losses carried forward
  If, for any tax period, your total monetary prizes referred to in subsection  126-10(1) exceed your total amounts wagered referred to in that subsection, the amount of that excess is to be added to your total monetary prizes, referred to in that subsection, for the next tax period.
Section 126-20 Bad debts
 (1) You cannot have an *adjustment under Division 21 in relation to a *gambling supply.
 (2) If, in a tax period, you write off as bad the whole or part of the *consideration for a *gambling supply that is due as a debt, but has not been received, the amount written off is to be added to your total monetary prizes, referred to in subsection  126-10(1), for that tax period.
 (3) However, if, in a tax period, you recover the whole or part of the amount written off, the amount recovered is to be added to your total amounts wagered, referred to in subsection  126-10(1), for that tax period.
 (4) This section has effect despite sections  21-5 and 21-10 (which are about adjustments for writing off and recovering suppliers&#39; bad debts).
Section 126-25 Application of Subdivision 9 - C
  Subdivision 9-C does not apply to a *gambling supply.
Section 126-27 When gambling supplies are connected with the indirect tax zone
 (1) A *gambling supply is connected with the indirect tax zone if the *recipient of the supply is an Australian resident (unless he or she is an Australian resident solely because the definition of Australia in the *ITAA 1997 includes the external Territories).
 (2) This section has effect in addition to section  9-25 (which is about when supplies are connected with the indirect tax zone).
Section 126-30 Gambling supplies do not give rise to creditable acquisitions
 (1) An acquisition of a thing is not a *creditable acquisition if the supply of the thing acquired was a *gambling supply.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  11-5 (which is about what is a creditable acquisition).
Section 126-32 Repayments of gambling losses are not consideration
 (1) A payment of *money or *digital currency is not the provision of *consideration to the extent that the payment:
 (a) is made by a supplier of *gambling supplies to a *recipient of gambling supplies that the supplier makes; and
 (b) is made, under an agreement between them, to repay to the recipient a proportion of his or her losses relating to those supplies.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  9-15 (which is about what is consideration).
Section 126-33 Tax invoices not required for gambling supplies
 (1) You are not required to issue a *tax invoice for a *taxable supply that you make that is solely a *gambling supply.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  29-70 (which is about the requirement to issue tax invoices).
Section 126-35 Meaning of gambling supply and gambling event
 (1) A gambling supply is a *taxable supply involving:
 (a) the supply of a ticket (however described) in a lottery, raffle or similar undertaking; or
 (b) the acceptance of a bet (however described) relating to the outcome of a *gambling event.
 (2) A gambling event is:
 (a) the conducting of a lottery or raffle, or similar undertaking; or
 (b) a race, game, or sporting event, or any other event, for which there is an outcome.

Section 129-B Adjustment periods
Section 129-C When adjustments for acquisitions and importations arise
Section 129-D Amounts of adjustments for acquisitions and importations
Section 129-E Attributing adjustments under this Division
Section 129-1 What this Division is about
The extent to which an acquisition or importation is for a creditable purpose affects the amount of the resulting input tax credit. When the extent of creditable purpose is changed by later events, adjustments (for the purpose of working out net amounts under Part  2-4) may need to be made.
Section 129-5 Adjustments arising under this Division
 (1) An *adjustment can arise under this Division for:
 (a) an acquisition, even if it is not a *creditable acquisition; or
 (b) an importation, even if it is not a *creditable importation;
in respect of any *adjustment period for the acquisition or importation.
 (2) However, in determining:
 (a) whether an adjustment under this Division arises; or
 (b) the amount of such an *adjustment;
disregard any change in the extent to which the thing acquired or imported is *applied in making *financial supplies, unless you *exceed the financial acquisitions threshold.
Section 129-10 Adjustments do not arise under this Division for acquisitions and importations below a certain value
 (1) Despite section  129-5, an adjustment cannot arise under this Division for an acquisition or importation that *relates to business finance, unless the acquisition or importation had a *GST exclusive value of more than $10,000.
 (2) Despite section  129-5, an adjustment cannot arise under this Division for an acquisition or importation that does not *relate to business finance, unless the acquisition or importation had a *GST exclusive value of more than $1,000.
 (3) An acquisition or importation relates to business finance if, at the time of the acquisition or importation, it:
 (a) related solely or partly to making *financial supplies; and
 (b) was not solely or partly of a private or domestic nature.
Section 129-15 Adjustments do not arise under this Division where there are adjustments under Division 130
  Despite section  129-5, you cannot have an adjustment under this Division for an acquisition if you have already had an *adjustment under Division  130 (goods applied solely to private or domestic use) for the acquisition.
Section 129-20 Adjustment periods
 (1) An adjustment period for an acquisition or importation is a tax period applying to you that:
 (a) starts at least 12 months after the end of the tax period to which the acquisition or importation is attributable (or would be attributable if it were a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation); and
 (b) ends:
 (i) on 30 June in any year; or
 (ii) if none of the tax periods applying to you in a particular year ends on 30  June--closer to 30 June than any of the other tax periods applying to you in that year.
In addition, a tax period provided for under section 27-39 or 27-40 or subsection  151-55(1) or 162-85(1) is an adjustment period for the acquisition or importation.
Note: Section 27-39 deals with an incapacitated entity&#39;s tax periods. Section  27-40 and subsections 151-55(1) and 162-85(1) deal with an entity&#39;s concluding tax period.
 (2) Despite subsection  (1), for an acquisition or importation that *relates to business finance:
 (a) if the *GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is $50,000 or less--only the first such tax period is an adjustment period; or
 (b) if the GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is more than $50,000 but less than $500,000--only the first 5 such tax periods are adjustment periods; or
 (c) if the GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is $500,000 or more--only the first 10 such tax periods are adjustment periods.
 (3) Despite subsection  (1), for an acquisition or importation that does not *relate to business finance:
 (a) if the *GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is $5,000 or less--only the first 2 such tax periods are adjustment periods; or
 (b) if the GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is more than $5,000 but less than $500,000--only the first 5 such tax periods are adjustment periods; or
 (c) if the GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is $500,000 or more--only the first 10 such tax periods are adjustment periods.
However, the Commissioner may, having regard to record keeping requirements for the purposes of income tax, determine in writing that a fewer number of tax periods are adjustment periods for a particular class of acquisitions or importations that do not *relate to business finance.
Section 129-25 Effect on adjustment periods of things being disposed of etc.
 (1) Despite section  129-20, if:
 (a) you dispose of a thing acquired or imported (other than in circumstances giving rise to a *decreasing adjustment under Division 132); or
 (b) a thing acquired or imported is lost, stolen or destroyed; or
 (c) a thing is acquired only for a particular period and that period expires;
the next tax period applying to you that ends:
 (d) on 30 June in any year; or
 (e) if none of the tax periods applying to you in a particular year ends on 30  June--closer to 30 June than any of the other tax periods applying to you in that year;
is the last *adjustment period for the acquisition or importation in question.
 (2) Despite section  129-20, if:
 (a) you dispose of a thing acquired or imported; and
 (b) the disposal takes place in circumstances giving rise to a *decreasing adjustment under Division 132;
then:
 (c) the last *adjustment period to end before the disposal is the last adjustment period for the acquisition or importation in question; and
 (d) if no such adjustment period ended before the disposal, there is no adjustment period for the acquisition or importation.
 (3) This section does not apply to a disposal if this Division continues to apply to the acquisition or importation of the thing because of subsection  138-17(2).
Section 129-40 Working out whether you have an adjustment
 (1) This is how to work out whether you have an *increasing adjustment or a *decreasing adjustment under this Division, for an *adjustment period, for an acquisition or importation:
Method statementStep 1. Work out the extent (if any) to which you have *applied the thing acquired or imported for a *creditable purpose during the period of time:
 (a) starting when you acquired or imported the thing; and (b) ending at the end of the *adjustment period.
 This is the actual application of the thing.Step 2. Work out:
 (a) if you have not previously had an *adjustment under this Division for the acquisition or importation--the extent (if any) to which you acquired or imported the thing for a *creditable purpose; or (b) if you have previously had an *adjustment under this Division for the acquisition or importation--the *actual application of the thing in respect of the last adjustment.
 This is the intended or former application of the thing.Step 3. If the *actual application of the thing is less than its *intended or former application, you have an increasing adjustment, for the *adjustment period, for the acquisition or importation.Step 4. If the *actual application of the thing is greater than its *intended or former application, you have a decreasing adjustment, for the *adjustment period, for the acquisition or importation.Step 5. If the *actual application of the thing is the same as its *intended or former application, you have neither an increasing adjustment nor a decreasing adjustment, for the *adjustment period, for the acquisition or importation.
 (2) *Actual applications and *intended or former applications are to be expressed as percentages.
 (3) If the thing is acquired through a *reduced credit acquisition and, at the time of the acquisition, it was wholly for a *creditable purpose because of Division  70, the extent to which it was acquired for a creditable purpose is the reduced input tax credit percentage prescribed for the purposes of subsection 70-5(2) for an acquisition of that kind.
Section 129-45 Gifts to gift - deductible entities
 (1) If you are or were entitled to an input tax credit for the *creditable acquisition of a thing, an *adjustment does not arise under this Subdivision merely because you supply the thing as a gift to an *endorsed charity or *gift-deductible entity.
 (3) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a thing that you supply to a *gift-deductible entity endorsed as a deductible gift recipient (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) under section 30-120 of the ITAA 1997, unless:
 (a) the entity is:
 (i) an *endorsed charity; or
 (ii) a fund, authority or institution of a kind referred to in paragraph  30-125(1)(b) of the ITAA 1997; or
 (b) each purpose to which the supply relates is a *gift-deductible purpose of the entity.
Note: This subsection excludes from this section supplies to certain (but not all) gift-deductible entities that are only endorsed for the operation of a fund, authority or institution. However, supplies can be covered by this section if they relate to the principal purpose of the fund, authority or institution.
Section 129-50 Creditable purpose
 (1) You *apply a thing for a creditable purpose to the extent that you apply it in *carrying on your *enterprise.
 (2) However, you do not *apply a thing for a creditable purpose to the extent that:
 (a) the application relates to making supplies that are *input taxed; or
 (b) the application is of a private or domestic nature.
 (3) To the extent that an *application relates to making *financial supplies through an *enterprise, or a part of an enterprise, that you *carry on outside the indirect tax zone, the application is not, for the purposes of paragraph  (2)(a), treated as one that relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed.
Section 129-55 Meaning of apply
  Apply, in relation to a thing acquired or imported, includes:
 (a) supply the thing; and
 (b) consume, dispose of or destroy the thing; and
 (c) allow another entity to consume, dispose of or destroy the thing.
Section 129-70 The amount of an increasing adjustment
  The amount of an *increasing adjustment that you have under Step 3 of the Method statement in section 129-40 for the thing acquired or imported is worked out as follows:
where:
"full input tax credit" is the amount of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled for acquiring or importing the thing for the purpose of your *enterprise if:
 (a) the acquisition or importation had been solely for a *creditable purpose; and
 (b) in the case where the supply to you was a *taxable supply because of section 72-5 or 84-5--the supply had been or is a *taxable supply under section 9-5.
Section 129-75 The amount of a decreasing adjustment
  The amount of a *decreasing adjustment that you have under Step 4 of the Method statement in section 129-40 for the thing acquired or imported is worked out as follows:
where:
"full input tax credit" is the amount of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled for acquiring or importing the thing for the purpose of your *enterprise if:
 (a) the acquisition or importation had been solely for a *creditable purpose; and
 (b) in the case where the supply to you was a *taxable supply because of section 72-5 or 84-5--the supply had been or is a *taxable supply under section 9-5.
Section 129-80 Effect of adjustment under certain Divisions
  For the purpose of working out under this Subdivision the amount of an *adjustment for an acquisition, any adjustments under Division 19, 21, 133 or 134 that you have had for the acquisition are to be taken into account in working out the full input tax credit for the purpose of section  129-70 or 129-75.
Section 129-90 Attributing your adjustments for changes in extent of creditable purpose
 (1) An *adjustment that you have arising in respect of an *adjustment period under this Division is attributable to the tax period that is that adjustment period.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  29-20 (which is about attributing adjustments).
Section 130-1 What this Division is about
You may have an increasing adjustment if you apply solely to private or domestic use goods for which you had a full input tax credit.
Section 130-5 Goods applied solely to private or domestic use
 (1) You have an increasing adjustment if:
 (a) you made a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation of goods; and
 (b) the acquisition or importation was solely for a *creditable purpose; and
 (c) you *apply the goods solely to private or domestic use.
 (2) The amount of the increasing adjustment is an amount equal to the amount of the input tax credit to which you were entitled for the acquisition or importation, taking account of any *adjustments for the acquisition or importation.
 (3) However, this section does not apply if you have previously had an adjustment under Division  129 for the acquisition or importation.
Table of Subdivisions
Section 131-A Electing to have annual apportionment
Section 131-B Consequences of electing to have annual apportionment
Section 131-1 What this Division is about
In some cases, you may be able to claim a full input tax credit for acquisitions that are only partly for a creditable purpose. You will then have an increasing adjustment for a later tax period (that better matches your obligation to lodge an income tax return).
Section 131-5 Eligibility to make an annual apportionment election
 (1) You are eligible to make an *annual apportionment election if:
 (a) either:
 (i) you are a *small business entity (other than because of subsection 328-110(4) of the *ITAA 1997) for the *income year in which you make your election; or
 (ii) you do not carry on a *business and your *GST turnover does not exceed the *annual apportionment turnover threshold; and
 (b) you have not made any election under section  162-15 to pay GST by instalments (other than such an election that is no longer in effect); and
 (c) you have not made any *annual tax period election (other than such an election that is no longer in effect).
 (2) The annual apportionment turnover threshold is:
 (a) $2 million; or
 (b) such higher amount as the regulations specify.
Section 131-10 Making an annual apportionment election
 (1) You may make an *annual apportionment election if you are eligible under section 131-5.
 (2) Your election takes effect from:
 (a) the start of the earliest tax period for which, on the day on which you make your election, your *GST return is not yet due (taking into account any further period the Commissioner allows under paragraph  31-8(1)(b) or 31-10(1)(b)); or
 (b) the start of such other tax period as the Commissioner allows, in accordance with a request you make in the *approved form.
Note: Refusing a request to allow your election to take effect from the start of another tax period is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
Section 131-15 Annual apportionment elections by representative members of GST groups
 (1) A *representative member of a *GST group cannot make an *annual apportionment election unless each *member of the GST group is eligible under section 131-5.
 (2) If the *representative member makes such an election, or revokes such an election, each *member of the *GST group is taken to have made, or revoked, the election.
Section 131-20 Duration of an annual apportionment election
General rule
 (1) Your election ceases to have effect if:
 (a) you revoke it; or
 (b) the Commissioner disallows it under subsection  (3); or
 (c) in a case to which subparagraph  131-5(1)(a)(i) applied--you are not a *small business entity of the kind referred to in that subparagraph for an *income year; or
 (d) in a case to which subparagraph  131-5(1)(a)(ii) applied--on 31 July in a *financial year, you do not satisfy the requirements of that subparagraph.
Revocation
 (2) A revocation of your election is taken to have had, or has, effect at the start of the earliest tax period for which, on the day of the revocation, your *GST return is not yet due.
Disallowance
 (3) The Commissioner may disallow your election if, and only if, the Commissioner is satisfied that you have failed to comply with one or more of your obligations under a *taxation law.
Note: Disallowing your election is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (4) A disallowance of your election is taken to have had effect from the start of the tax period in which the Commissioner notifies you of the disallowance.
Not being a small business entity for an income year
 (5) If paragraph (1)(c) applies, your election is taken to have ceased to have effect from the start of the tax period in which the first day of the *income year referred to in that paragraph falls.
Failing to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph 131-5(1)(a)(ii)
 (6) If paragraph (1)(d) applies, your election is taken to have ceased to have effect from the start of the tax period in which 31  July in the *financial year referred to in that paragraph falls.
Section 131-40 Input tax credits for acquisitions that are partly creditable
 (1) The amount of the input tax credit on an acquisition that you make that is *partly creditable is an amount equal to the GST payable on the supply of the thing acquired if:
 (a) an *annual apportionment election that you have made has effect at the end of the tax period to which the input tax credit is attributable; and
 (b) the acquisition is not an acquisition of a kind specified in the regulations.
 (2) However, if one or both of the following apply to the acquisition:
 (a) the acquisition relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed;
 (b) you provide, or are liable to provide, only part of the *consideration for the acquisition;
the amount of the input tax credit on the acquisition is as follows:
where:
"extent of consideration" is the extent to which you provide, or are liable to provide, the *consideration for the acquisition, expressed as a percentage of the total consideration for the acquisition.
"extent of non-input-taxed purpose" is the extent to which the acquisition does not relate to making supplies that would be *input taxed, expressed as a percentage of the total purpose of the acquisition.
"full input tax credit" is what would have been the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition if it had been made solely for a *creditable purpose and you had provided, or had been liable to provide, all of the consideration for the acquisition.
 (3) In determining for the purposes of subsection (2) whether, or the extent to which, an acquisition relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed, subsections 11-15(3) to (5) apply in the same way that they apply for the purposes of paragraph  11-15(2)(a).
 (4) Determinations made by the Commissioner under subsection  11-30(5) apply (so far as they are capable of applying) to working out the extent to which a *partly creditable acquisition does not relate to making supplies that would be *input taxed.
 (5) This section does not apply to an input tax credit on an acquisition if the acquisition is, to any extent, a *reduced credit acquisition.
 (6) This section has effect despite sections  11-25 and 11-30 (which are about amounts of input tax credits).
Section 131-45 Input tax credits for importations that are partly creditable
 (1) The amount of the input tax credit on an importation that you make that is *partly creditable is an amount equal to the GST payable on the importation if:
 (a) an *annual apportionment election that you have made has effect at the end of the tax period to which the input tax credit is attributable; and
 (b) the importation is not an importation of a kind specified in the regulations.
 (2) However, if the importation relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed, the amount of the input tax credit on the importation is as follows:
where:
"extent of non-input-taxed purpose" is the extent to which the importation does not relate to making supplies that would be *input taxed, expressed as a percentage of the total purpose of the importation.
"full input tax credit" is what would have been the amount of the input tax credit for the importation if it had been made solely for a *creditable purpose.
 (3) In determining for the purposes of subsection  (2) whether, or the extent to which, an importation relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed, subsections  15-10(3) to (5) apply in the same way that they apply for the purposes of paragraph 15-10(2)(a).
 (4) Determinations made by the Commissioner under subsection  15-25(4) apply (so far as they are capable of applying) to working out the extent to which a *partly creditable importation does not relate to making supplies that would be *input taxed.
 (5) This section has effect despite sections  15-20 and 15-25 (which are about amounts of input tax credits).
Section 131-50 Amounts of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions or creditable importations of certain cars
 (1) If:
 (a) this Division applies to working out the amount of a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation that you made; and
 (b) the acquisition or importation is an acquisition or importation of a *car;
the amount of the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation under this Division must not exceed the amount (if any) of the input tax credit worked out under section  69-10.
 (2) However, if subsection  131-40(2) or 131-45(2) applies to the acquisition or importation:
 (a) take into account the operation of section  69-10 in working out the full input tax credit for the purposes of that subsection; but
 (b) disregard subsection  69-10(3).
Section 131-55 Increasing adjustments relating to annually apportioned acquisitions and importations
 (1) You have an increasing adjustment if:
 (a) an acquisition or importation that you made was *partly creditable; and
 (b) the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation is attributable to a tax period ending in a particular *financial year; and
 (c) the amount of the input tax credit is an amount worked out under this Division.
 (2) The amount of the increasing adjustment is an amount equal to the difference between:
 (a) the amount of the input tax credit worked out under this Division; and
 (b) what would have been the amount of the input tax credit if this Division did not apply.
 (3) In working out for the purposes of paragraph  (2)(a) the amount of an input tax credit, take into account any change of circumstances that has given rise to:
 (a) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division  19; or
 (b) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division  21; or
 (c) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division  134.
Note: Because of subsection 136-10(3), the amount of the Division  21 adjustment will not be reduced under Division 136.
 (4) In working out for the purposes of paragraph  (2)(b) what would have been the amount of an input tax credit, take into account any change of circumstances that has given rise to:
 (a) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division  19 (worked out as if this Division had not applied to working out the amount of the input tax credit); or
 (b) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division  21; or
 (c) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division  134.
Note: If this Division did not apply, the amount of the Division 21 adjustment would have been worked out under Division  136.
Example: While an annual apportionment election has effect, you make a partly creditable acquisition for $1,100, for which you have an input tax credit of $100. The extent of your creditable purpose is 10%.
 During later tax periods, the price increases by $110, for which you have a decreasing adjustment under Division  19 of $10, and the supplier writes off $660 as a bad debt, for which you have an increasing adjustment under Division 21 of $60 (subsection  136-10(3) prevents the amount from being reduced under Division 136).
 The amount of your increasing adjustment under this section is $45. This is the difference between the amounts under paragraphs  (2)(a) and (b).
 The paragraph (2)(a) amount (which is effectively worked out on a fully creditable basis) is:
 The paragraph (2)(b) amount (which is based on a 10% creditable purpose) is:
Section 131-60 Attributing adjustments under section 131 - 55
 (1) An *increasing adjustment under section 131-55 is attributable to:
 (a) the tax period worked out using the method statement; or
 (b) such earlier tax period as you choose.
Method statementStep 1. Work out the tax period (the ITC tax period) to which the input tax credit for the acquisition or importation to which the adjustment relates is attributable.Step 2. Work out in which year of income that tax period starts.Step 3. If you are required under section  161 of the *ITAA 1936 to lodge a return in relation to that year of income, work out the last day of the period, specified in the instrument made under that section, for you to lodge as required under that section.Step 4. The *increasing adjustment is attributable to the tax period in which that last day occurs.Step 5. If step 3 does not apply, the increasing adjustment is attributable to the tax period in which occurs 31  December in the next *financial year to start after the end of the ITC tax period.
Note: Section 388-55 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 allows the Commissioner to defer the time for giving the GST return.
 (2) Despite subsection  (1), if, during (but not from the start of) the *financial year in which the ITC tax period ended, your *annual apportionment election ceases to have effect because:
 (a) you revoke your annual apportionment election, or the Commissioner disallows your election, during that financial year; and
 (b) the revocation or disallowance takes effect before the end of that financial year;
the *increasing adjustment is attributable to the tax period in which the cessation takes effect, or to such earlier tax period as you choose.
 (3) However, the *increasing adjustment is attributable to a tax period provided under section  27-39 or 27-40 if that tax period ends earlier than the end of the tax period to which the increasing adjustment would, but for this subsection, be attributable under subsections  (1) and (2).
 (4) This section has effect despite section  29-20 (which is about attributing your adjustments).
Section 132-1 What this Division is about
You may have a decreasing adjustment if you make a supply of something that you earlier acquired or imported, or subsequently applied, to make financial supplies or for a private or domestic purpose.
Section 132-5 Decreasing adjustments for supplies of things acquired, imported or applied for a purpose that is not fully creditable
 (1) You have a decreasing adjustment under this Division if:
 (a) you make a *taxable supply of a thing (or a supply of a thing that would have been a taxable supply had it not been *GST-free under Subdivision 38-J); and
 (b) the supply is a supply by way of sale; and
 (c) your acquisition, importation or subsequent *application of the thing, related solely or partly to making *financial supplies, or was solely or partly of a private or domestic nature.
 (2) The amount of the *decreasing adjustment is as follows:
where:
"adjusted input tax credit" is:
 (a) the amount of any input tax credit that was attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition or importation; minus
 (b) the sum of:
 (i) any *increasing adjustments, under Subdivision 19-C or Division 129, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition or importation; and
 (ii) any increasing adjustment under Division  131 that has been previously, is or will be attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition or importation; plus
 (c) the sum of any *decreasing adjustments, under Subdivision 19-C or Division 129 or 133, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition or importation.
"full input tax credit" is the amount of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled for acquiring or importing the thing for the purpose of your *enterprise if:
 (a) the acquisition or importation had been solely for a *creditable purpose; and
 (b) in the case where the supply to you was a *taxable supply because of section 72-5 or 84-5--the supply had been or is a *taxable supply under section 9-5.
"price" is the *price of the *taxable supply.
 (3) However, if the amount worked out under subsection  (2) is greater than the difference between the full input tax credit and the adjusted input tax credit, the amount of the *decreasing adjustment is an amount equal to that difference.
 (4) In working out the adjusted input tax credit, the acquisition, importation or *application in question is treated as having been for a *creditable purpose except to the extent *that the acquisition, importation or application:
 (a) relates to the making of *financial supplies; or
 (b) is of a private or domestic nature.
Section 132-10 Attribution of adjustments under this Division
 (1) A *decreasing adjustment under this Division is attributable to:
 (a) the same tax period as the *taxable supply to which it relates; or
 (b) if it relates to a supply that is not a taxable supply--the tax period to which the supply would be attributable if it were a taxable supply.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  29-20 (which is about attributing your adjustments).
Section 133-1 What this Division is about
You may have a decreasing adjustment for an acquisition that you made if, to take account of a GST liability that the supplier is subsequently found to have, you provide additional consideration at a time when you can no longer claim an input tax credit.
Section 133-5 Decreasing adjustments for additional consideration provided under gross - up clauses
 (1) You have a decreasing adjustment if:
 (a) you made an acquisition on the basis that:
 (i) it was not a *creditable acquisition because the supply to which the acquisition relates was not a *taxable supply; or
 (ii) it was *partly creditable because the supply to which the acquisition relates was only partly a taxable supply; and
 (b) you provided *additional consideration for the acquisition in compliance with a contractual obligation that required you, or had the effect of requiring you, to provide additional consideration if:
 (i) in a case where subparagraph  (a)(i) applies--the supply was later found to be a taxable supply, or to be partly a taxable supply; or
 (ii) in a case where subparagraph  (a)(ii) applies--the supply was later found to be a taxable supply to a greater extent; and
 (c) GST on the supply has not ceased to be payable (other than as a result of its payment); and
 (d) at the time you provided the additional consideration, you were no longer entitled to an input tax credit for the acquisition.
Note: Section 93-5 or 93-15 may provide a time limit on your entitlement to an input tax credit.
 (2) The amount of the *decreasing adjustment is the difference between:
 (a) what would have been the *previously attributed input tax credit amount for the acquisition if:
 (i) the *additional consideration for the acquisition had been provided as part of the original *consideration for the acquisition; and
 (ii) in a case where you have not held a *tax invoice for the acquisition--you held such an invoice; and
 (iii) subsection 29-10(4) did not apply in relation to the acquisition; and
 (b) the previously attributed input tax credit amount.
 (3) To avoid doubt, additional consideration for an acquisition includes a part of the *consideration for the acquisition that:
 (a) relates to the amount of GST payable on the *taxable supply to which the acquisition relates; and
 (b) at the time of the acquisition, the parties to the transaction under which the acquisition was made assumed was not payable.
Section 133-10 Availability of adjustments under Division 19 for acquisitions
 (1) If:
 (a) you have a *decreasing adjustment under this Division for an acquisition; and
 (b) the circumstances that gave rise to the adjustment also constitute an *adjustment event;
you do not have a decreasing adjustment under section 19-70 for the acquisition in relation to those circumstances.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  19-70 (which is about adjustments for acquisitions arising because of adjustment events).
Section 134-1 What this Division is about
You may have a decreasing adjustment if you make a payment to an entity that acquires something that you had supplied to another entity. The entity receiving the payment may have an increasing adjustment.
Section 134-5 Decreasing adjustments for payments made to third parties
 (1) You have a decreasing adjustment if:
 (a) you make a payment to an entity (the payee) that acquires a thing that you supplied to another entity (whether or not that other entity supplies the thing to the payee); and
 (b) your supply of the thing to the other entity:
 (i) was a *taxable supply; or
 (ii) would have been a taxable supply but for a reason to which subsection  (3) applies; and
 (c) the payment is in one or more of the following forms:
 (i) a payment of *money or *digital currency;
 (ii) an offset of an amount of money or digital currency that the payee owes to you;
 (iii) a crediting of an amount of money or digital currency to an account that the payee holds; and
 (d) the payment is made in connection with, in response to or for the inducement of the payee&#39;s acquisition of the thing; and
 (e) the payment is not *consideration for a supply to you.
 (1A) However, subsection  (1) does not apply if:
 (a) the supply of the thing to the payee is a *GST-free supply, or is not *connected with the indirect tax zone; or
 (b) the Commissioner is required to make a payment to the payee, under Division  168 (about the tourist refund scheme), related to the payee&#39;s acquisition of the thing;
and you know, or have reasonable grounds to suspect, that the supply of the thing to the payee is a GST-free supply or is not connected with the indirect tax zone, or that the Commissioner is so required.
 (2) The amount of the *decreasing adjustment is an amount equal to the difference between:
 (a) either:
 (i) if your supply to the other entity was a *taxable supply--the amount of GST payable on the supply; or
 (ii) if your supply to the other entity would have been a taxable supply but for a reason to which subsection  (3) applies--the amount of GST that would have been payable on the supply had it been a taxable supply;
  taking into account any other *adjustments that arose, or would have arisen, relating to the supply; and
 (b) the amount of GST that would have been payable, or would (but for a reason to which subsection  (3) applies) have been payable, for that supply:
 (i) if the *consideration for the supply had been reduced by the amount of your payment to the payee; and
 (ii) taking into account any other adjustments that arose, or would have arisen, relating to the supply, as they would have been affected (if applicable) by such a reduction in the consideration.
 (3) This subsection applies to the following reasons why your supply of the thing to the other entity was not a *taxable supply:
 (a) you and the other entity are *members of the same *GST group;
 (b) you and the other entity are members of the same *GST religious group;
 (c) you are the *joint venture operator for a *GST joint venture, and the other entity is a *participant in the GST joint venture.
 (4) However:
 (a) paragraph (3)(a) does not apply if you and the payee are *members of the same *GST group when the payment referred to in paragraph  (1)(a) is made; and
 (b) paragraph (3)(b) does not apply if you and the payee are members of the same *GST religious group when that payment is made.
Section 134-10 Increasing adjustments for payments received by third parties
 (1) You have an increasing adjustment if:
 (a) you receive a payment from an entity (the payer) that supplied a thing that you acquire from another entity (whether or not that other entity acquired the thing from the payer); and
 (b) your acquisition of the thing from the other entity:
 (i) was a *creditable acquisition; or
 (ii) would have been a creditable acquisition but for a reason to which subsection  (3) applies; and
 (c) the payment is in one or more of the following forms:
 (i) a payment of *money or *digital currency;
 (ii) an offset of an amount of money or digital currency that you owe to the payer;
 (iii) a crediting of an amount of money or digital currency to an account that you hold; and
 (d) the payment is made in connection with, in response to or for the inducement of your acquisition of the thing; and
 (e) the payment is not *consideration for a supply you make.
 (1A) However, subsection  (1) does not apply unless the supply of the thing by the payer:
 (a) was a *taxable supply; or
 (b) would have been a taxable supply but for any of the following:
 (i) the payer and the entity that acquired the thing from the payer being *members of the same *GST group;
 (ii) the payer and the entity that acquired the thing from the payer being members of the same *GST religious group;
 (iii) the payer being the *joint venture operator for a *GST joint venture, and the entity that acquired the thing from the payer being a *participant in the GST joint venture.
 (2) The amount of the *increasing adjustment is an amount equal to the difference between:
 (a) either:
 (i) if your acquisition from the other entity was a *creditable acquisition--the amount of the input tax credit entitlement for the acquisition; or
 (ii) if your acquisition from the other entity would have been a creditable acquisition but for a reason to which subsection  (3) applies--the amount that would have been the amount of the input tax credit entitlement for the acquisition had it been a creditable acquisition;
  taking into account any other *adjustments that arose, or would have arisen, relating to the acquisition; and
 (b) the amount of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled, or would (but for a reason to which subsection  (3) applies) have been entitled, for that acquisition:
 (i) if the *consideration for the acquisition had been reduced by the amount of the payer&#39;s payment to you; and
 (ii) taking into account any other adjustments that arose, or would have arisen, relating to the acquisition, as they would have been affected (if applicable) by such a reduction in the consideration.
 (3) This subsection applies to the following reasons why your acquisition of the thing from the other entity was not a *creditable acquisition:
 (a) you and the other entity are *members of the same *GST group;
 (b) you and the other entity are members of the same *GST religious group;
 (c) you are the *joint venture operator for a *GST joint venture, and the other entity is a *participant in the GST joint venture.
 (4) However:
 (a) paragraph (3)(a) does not apply if you and the payer are *members of the same *GST group when the payment referred to in paragraph  (1)(a) is made; and
 (b) paragraph (3)(b) does not apply if you and the payer are members of the same *GST religious group when that payment is made.
Section 134-15 Attribution of decreasing adjustments
 (1) If:
 (a) you have a *decreasing adjustment under section 134-5; and
 (b) you do not hold a *third party adjustment note for the adjustment when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the adjustment (or any part of the adjustment) would otherwise be attributable;
then:
 (c) the adjustment (including any part of the adjustment) is not attributable to that tax period; and
 (d) the adjustment (or part) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you hold that third party adjustment note.
However, this subsection does not apply in circumstances of a kind determined by the Commissioner, by legislative instrument, to be circumstances in which the requirement for an adjustment note does not apply.
Note: For the giving of GST returns to the Commissioner, see Division 31.
 (2) This section does not apply to a *decreasing adjustment of an amount that does not exceed the amount provided for under subsection 29-80(2).
 (3) This section has effect despite section  29-20 (which is about attributing adjustments).
Section 134-20 Third party adjustment notes
 (1) A third party adjustment note for a *decreasing adjustment that you have under section  134-5 is a document:
 (a) that is created by you; and
 (b) a copy of which is given, in the circumstances set out in subsection  (2), to the entity that received the payment that gave rise to the adjustment; and
 (c) that sets out your *ABN; and
 (d) that contains such other information as the Commissioner determines in writing; and
 (e) that is in the *approved form.
However, the Commissioner may treat as a third party adjustment note a particular document that is not a third party adjustment note.
 (2) You must give the copy of the document to the entity that received the payment:
 (a) within 28 days after the entity requests you to give the copy; or
 (b) if you become aware of the *adjustment before the copy is requested--within 28 days, or such other number of days as the Commissioner determines under subsection (4) or (6), after becoming aware of the adjustment.
 (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to an *adjustment of an amount that does not exceed the amount provided for under subsection 29-80(2).
 (4) The Commissioner may determine in writing that paragraph  (2)(b) has effect, in relation to a particular document, as if the number of days referred to in that paragraph is the number of days specified in the determination.
 (5) A determination made under subsection  (4) is not a legislative instrument.
 (6) The Commissioner may determine, by legislative instrument, circumstances in which paragraph  (2)(b) has effect, in relation to those circumstances, as if the number of days referred to in that paragraph is the number of days specified in the determination.
 (7) A determination made under subsection  (4) has effect despite any determination made under subsection (6).
Section 134-25 Adjustment events do not arise
  To avoid doubt, a payment that gives rise to an *adjustment under this Division cannot give rise to an *adjustment event.
Section 134-30 Application of sections 48 - 55 and 49 - 50
 (1) For the purposes of working out whether you have an adjustment under this Division, disregard sections  48-55 and 49-50.
 (2) However, this section does not affect the application of sections  48-55 and 49-50 for the purposes of working out the amount of an adjustment under this Division.
Note: Sections 48-55 and 49-50 require GST groups and GST religious groups to be treated as single entities for the purposes of adjustments.
Section 135-1 What this Division is about
The recipient of a supply of a going concern has an increasing adjustment to take into account the proportion (if any) of supplies that will be made in running the concern and that will not be taxable supplies or GST -free supplies. Later adjustments are needed if this proportion changes over time.
Section 135-5 Initial adjustments for supplies of going concerns
 (1) You have an increasing adjustment if:
 (a) you are the *recipient of a *supply of a going concern, or a supply that is *GST-free under section 38-480; and
 (b) you intend that some or all of the supplies made through the *enterprise to which the supply relates will be supplies that are neither *taxable supplies nor *GST-free supplies.
 (2) The amount of the increasing adjustment is as follows:
where:
"proportion of non-creditable use" is the proportion of all the supplies made through the *enterprise that you intend will be supplies that are neither *taxable supplies nor *GST-free supplies, expressed as a percentage worked out on the basis of the *prices of those supplies.
"supply price" means the *price of the supply in relation to which the increasing adjustment arises.
Section 135-10 Later adjustments for supplies of going concerns
 (1) If you are the *recipient of a *supply of a going concern, or a supply that is *GST-free under section 38-480, Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose) applies to that acquisition, in relation to:
 (a) the proportion of all the supplies made through the *enterprise that you intend will be supplies that are neither *taxable supplies nor *GST-free supplies; and
 (b) the proportion of all the supplies made through the *enterprise that are supplies that are neither taxable supplies nor GST-free supplies;
in the same way as that Division applies:
 (c) in relation to the extent to which you made an acquisition for a *creditable purpose; and
 (d) in relation to the extent to which a thing acquired is *applied for a creditable purpose.
 (2) For the purpose of applying Division  129, the proportions referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) are to be expressed as percentages worked out on the basis of the *prices of the supplies in question.
 (3) This section applies in relation to any *supply of a going concern, or a supply that is *GST-free under section  38-480, whether or not it is a supply in respect of which you have had an *increasing adjustment under section  135-5.
Table of Subdivisions
Section 136-A Bad debts relating to partly taxable or creditable transactions
Section 136-B Bad debts relating to transactions that are taxable or creditable at less than 1/11 of the price
Section 136-1 What this Division is about
The amount of an adjustment that you have under Division 21 for a bad debt is reduced under this Division if the transaction to which the adjustment relates:&bull;  was a supply that was partly taxable or an acquisition that was partly creditable; or&bull;  was fully taxable or creditable, but not to the extent of 1/11 of the price or consideration for the transaction.
Section 136-5 Adjustments relating to partly taxable supplies
  If you have an *adjustment under section 21-5, 21-10, 136-30 or 136-35 in relation to a supply that was partly a *taxable supply, the amount of that adjustment is reduced to the following amount:
where:
"full adjustment" is what would be the amount of the adjustment worked out under section 21-5, 21 -10, 136-30 or 136-35 if this section did not apply.
"taxable proportion" is the proportion of the *value of the supply (worked out as if it were solely a taxable supply) that the taxable supply represents.
Example: If the amount of an adjustment under section 21-5 would be $100 but the supply was only 80% taxable, the amount of the adjustment is $80.
Section 136-10 Adjustments in relation to partly creditable acquisitions
 (1) If you have an *adjustment under section 21-15, 21-20, 136-40 or 136-45 in relation to a *creditable acquisition that was *partly creditable, the amount of that adjustment is reduced to the following amount:
where:
"extent of consideration" is the extent to which you provide, or are liable to provide, the *consideration for the acquisition, expressed as a percentage of the total consideration for the acquisition.
"extent of creditable purpose" is the extent of *creditable purpose last used to work out:
 (a) the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition; or
 (b) the amount of any *adjustment under Division 129 in relation to the acquisition;
expressed as a percentage of the total purpose of the acquisition.
"full adjustment" is what would be the amount of the adjustment worked out under section 21-15, 21 -20, 136-40 or 136-45 if this section did not apply.
 (2) If you have an *adjustment under section 21-15, 21-20, 136-40 or 136-45 in relation to a *creditable acquisition that was a *reduced credit acquisition and that was not *partly creditable (that is, it is wholly for a *creditable purpose because of Division 70), the amount of that adjustment is reduced to the following amount:
where:
"extent of consideration" is the extent to which you provide, or are liable to provide, the *consideration for the acquisition, expressed as a percentage of the total consideration for the acquisition.
"percentage credit reduction" is the reduced input tax credit percentage prescribed for the purposes of subsection  70-5(2) for an acquisition of that kind.
"full adjustment" is what would be the amount of the adjustment worked out under section 21-15, 21 -20, 136-40 or 136-45 if this section did not apply.
 (3) However, this section does not apply to an *adjustment that you have in relation to a *creditable acquisition if:
 (a) the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition is worked out under Division  131; and
 (b) the adjustment is attributable to a tax period that is not later than the tax period to which an adjustment under section  131-55 relating to the acquisition is attributable.
Section 136-30 Writing off bad debts (taxable supplies)
 (1) The amount of a *decreasing adjustment that you have under section 21-5, relating to a *taxable supply that is *taxable at less than 1/11 of the price, is worked out under this section and not under section  21-5.
 (2) This is how to work out the amount:
Method statementStep 1. Work out the amount of GST (if any) that was payable on the supply, taking into account any previous *adjustments for the supply. This amount is the previous GST amount.Step 2. Add together:
 (a) the amount or amounts written off as bad from the debt to which the decreasing adjustment relates; and (b) the amount of the debt that has been *overdue for 12 months or more (other than amounts already written off).
Step 3. Subtract the step 2 amount from the *price of the supply.Step 4. Work out the amount of GST (if any), taking into account any previous *adjustments for the supply (but not adjustments relating to bad debts or debts overdue), that would be payable on the supply if the *price of the supply were the step 3 amount. This amount of GST is the adjusted GST amount.Step 5. Subtract the adjusted GST amount from the previous GST amount.
Section 136-35 Recovering amounts previously written off (taxable supplies)
 (1) The amount of an *increasing adjustment that you have under section 21-10, relating to a *taxable supply that is *taxable at less than 1/11 of the price, is worked out under this section and not under section  21-10.
 (2) This is how to work out the amount:
Method statementStep 1. Work out the amount of GST (if any) that was payable on the supply, taking into account any previous *adjustments for the supply. This amount is the previous GST amount.Step 2. Add together:
 (a) the amount or amounts previously written off as bad from the debt to which the increasing adjustment relates; and (b) the amount of the debt that has been *overdue for 12 months or more (other than amounts already written off).
Step 3. Subtract the step 2 amount from the *price of the supply.Step 4. Add to the step 3 amount an amount equal to the amount or amounts, written off or overdue for 12 months or more, that have been recovered.Step 5. Work out the amount of GST (if any), taking into account any previous *adjustments for the supply (but not adjustments relating to bad debts or debts overdue), that would be payable on the supply if the *price of the supply were the step 4 amount. This amount of GST is the adjusted GST amount.Step 6. Subtract the previous GST amount from the adjusted GST amount.
Section 136-40 Bad debts written off (creditable acquisitions)
 (1) The amount of an *increasing adjustment that you have under section  21-15, relating to a *creditable acquisition that is *creditable at less than 1/11 of the consideration, is worked out under this section and not under section  21-15.
 (2) This is how to work out the amount:
Method statementStep 1. Work out the amount of the input tax credit (if any) to which you were entitled for the acquisition, taking into account any previous *adjustments for the acquisition. This amount is the previous credit amount.Step 2. Add together:
 (a) the amount or amounts previously written off as bad from the debt to which the increasing adjustment relates; and (b) the amount of the debt that has been *overdue for 12 months or more (other than amounts already written off).
Step 3. Subtract the step 2 amount from the total amount of the *consideration that you have either provided, or are liable to provide, for the acquisition.Step 4. Work out the amount of the input tax credit (if any), taking into account any previous *adjustments for the acquisition (but not adjustments relating to bad debts or debts overdue), to which you would be entitled for the acquisition if the *consideration for the acquisition were the step 3 amount. This amount of GST is the adjusted credit amount .Step 5. Subtract the adjusted credit amount from the previous credit amount.
Section 136-45 Recovering amounts previously written off (creditable acquisitions)
 (1) The amount of a *decreasing adjustment that you have under section  21-20, relating to a *creditable acquisition that is *creditable at less than 1/11 of the consideration, is worked out under this section and not under section  21-20.
 (2) This is how to work out the amount:
Method statementStep 1. Work out the amount of the input tax credit (if any) to which you were entitled for the acquisition, taking into account any previous *adjustments for the acquisition. This amount is the previous credit amount.Step 2. Add together:
 (a) the amount or amounts previously written off as bad from the debt to which the decreasing adjustment relates; and (b) the amount of the debt that has been *overdue for 12 months or more (other than amounts already written off).
Step 3. Subtract the step 2 amount from the total amount of the *consideration that you have either provided, or are liable to provide, for the acquisition.Step 4. Add to the step 3 amount an amount equal to the amount or amounts, written off or overdue for 12 months or more, that you have paid.Step 5. Work out the amount of the input tax credit (if any), taking into account any previous *adjustments for the acquisition (but not adjustments relating to bad debts or debts overdue), to which you would be entitled for the acquisition if the *consideration for the acquisition were the step 4 amount. This amount of GST is the adjusted credit amount.Step 6. Subtract the previous credit amount from the adjusted credit amount.
Section 136-50 Meanings of taxable at less than 1 / 11 of the price and creditable at less than 1 / 11 of the consideration
 (1) A *taxable supply is taxable at less than 1/11 of the price if the amount of GST payable on the supply is an amount that is less than 1/11 of the *price of the supply.
 (2) A *creditable acquisition is creditable at less than 1/11 of the consideration if the *taxable supply to which it relates is *taxable at less than 1/11 of the price.
Section 137-1 What this Division is about
If you become registered or required to be registered, you may have a decreasing adjustment for stock you have already acquired.
Section 137-5 Adjustments for stock on hand on becoming registered etc.
 (1) You have a decreasing adjustment if:
 (a) you become *registered or *required to be registered; and
 (b) at that time, you hold stock for the purpose of sale or exchange, or for use as raw materials, in *carrying on your *enterprise; and
 (c) you had acquired the stock solely or partly for a *creditable purpose.

Section 138-1 What this Division is about
An entity whose registration has been cancelled may still have acquisitions and importations for which entitlements to input tax credits have arisen. This Division provides for an increasing adjustment to cancel those input tax credits.
Section 138-5 Adjustments for cessation of registration
 (1) You have an increasing adjustment if:
 (a) your *registration is cancelled; and
 (b) immediately before the cancellation takes effect, your assets include anything in respect of which you were, or are, entitled to an input tax credit.
Note: Increasing adjustments increase your net amounts.
 (2) The amount of the adjustment, for each thing referred to in paragraph  (1)(b), is as follows:
where:
"applicable value" is:
 (a) the *GST inclusive market value of the thing immediately before the cancellation takes effect; or
 (b) if you were, or are, entitled to an input tax credit for acquiring the thing--the amount of the *consideration that you provided, or were liable to provide, for your acquisition of the thing, but only if the amount is less than that value; or
 (c) if you were, or are, entitled to an input tax credit for importing the thing--the cost to you of acquiring or producing the thing (plus the *assessed GST paid on its importation), but only if the amount is less than that value.
 (3) However, an *adjustment does not arise under this section in respect of an asset if:
 (a) there were one or more *adjustment periods for your acquisition or importation of the asset; and
 (b) the last of those adjustment periods has ended before the cancellation of your *registration takes effect.
Section 138-10 Attributing adjustments for cessation of registration
 (1) An *adjustment that you have under this Division is attributable to:
 (aa) if you are an *incapacitated entity--your tax period under section 27-39; or
 (a) your concluding tax period under section  27-40; or
 (b) if, because of subsection  151-55(1) or 162-85(1), you do not have a concluding tax period under section 27-40--the tax period to which that subsection applies.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  29-20 (which is about attributing your adjustments).
Section 138-15 Ceasing to be registered--amounts not previously attributed
 (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply, the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition, or an *adjustment that you have, is attributable to a particular tax period, and no other, if:
 (a) during the tax period, your *registration is cancelled; and
 (b) immediately before the cancellation, you were *accounting on a cash basis; and
 (c) the GST on the supply, the input tax credit on the acquisition, or the adjustment, was not attributable, to any extent, to a previous tax period during which you accounted on a cash basis; and
 (d) it would have been attributable to that previous tax period had you not accounted on a cash basis during that period.
For accounting on a cash basis, see Subdivision 29-B.
 (2) This section has effect despite sections 29-5, 29-10 and 29-20 (which are about attributing GST on supplies, input tax credits on acquisitions, and adjustments) and any other provisions of this Chapter.
Section 138-17 Situations to which this Division does not apply
 (1) This Division does not apply to anything included in the assets of an entity whose *registration is cancelled, to the extent that the thing relates to an *enterprise that the entity *carried on before the cancellation, if:
 (a) the cancellation arises as a result of the death of the entity, and the executor or trustee of the deceased estate:
 (i) is registered or is *required to be registered; and
 (ii) continues, immediately after the cancellation, to carry on that enterprise; or
 (b) the cancellation arises as a result of the executor or trustee of a deceased estate ceasing to carry on any enterprise, and one or more beneficiaries of the deceased estate:
 (i) are registered or is *required to be registered; and
 (ii) continue, immediately after the cancellation, to carry on the enterprise that the deceased had carried on.
 (2) Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose) continues to apply to the acquisition or importation of the thing immediately after the cancellation if:
 (a) Subdivision 129-A does not prevent an adjustment arising under that Division for the acquisition or importation; and
 (b) the cancellation occurs during an *adjustment period for the acquisition or importation.
 (3) For the purposes of applying Division  129 to the acquisition or importation after the cancellation:
 (a) the entity *carrying on the *enterprise in question immediately after the cancellation is taken to have made the acquisition or importation at the time it was originally made; and
 (b) the extent (if any) to which the thing was originally acquired or imported for a *creditable purpose is taken to be the extent (if any) to which the entity acquired or imported the thing for a creditable purpose; and
 (c) any *application of the thing since the original acquisition or importation is taken to be an application of the thing by the entity.
Section 138-20 Application of Division 129
  This Division (except subsections  138-17(2) and (3)) does not affect the operation of Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose).
Section 139-1 What this Division is about
Distributions from deceased estates, for private consumption, that are not taxable supplies may involve disposing of assets that were acquired or imported in circumstances giving rise to entitlements to input tax credits. This Division provides for an increasing adjustment to cancel those input tax credits.
Section 139-5 Adjustments for distributions from deceased estates
 (1) You have an increasing adjustment if:
 (a) you are the executor or trustee of a deceased estate; and
 (b) you are *registered or *required to be registered; and
 (c) you supply an asset of the deceased estate to a beneficiary of the deceased estate; and
 (d) the supply is not a *taxable supply and is not a supply that is *GST-free or *input taxed; and
 (e) you were, or are, or the deceased person was, entitled to an input tax credit for the deceased person&#39;s acquisition or importation of the asset.
Note: Increasing adjustments increase your net amounts.
 (2) The amount of the adjustment, for the asset, is as follows:
where:
"applicable value" is:
 (a) the *GST inclusive market value of the asset immediately before it is supplied; or
 (b) if you were, or are, or the deceased person was, entitled to an input tax credit for the deceased person acquiring the thing--the amount of the *consideration that you or the deceased person provided, or was liable to provide, for the acquisition of the thing, but only if the amount is less than that value; or
 (c) if you were, or are, or the deceased person was, entitled to an input tax credit for the deceased person importing the thing--the cost to you or the deceased person of acquiring or producing the thing (plus the *assessed GST paid on its importation), but only if the amount is less than that value.
 (3) However, an *adjustment does not arise under this section in respect of the asset if:
 (a) the asset related to an *enterprise that the deceased person *carried on, and the beneficiary intends to continue to carry on that enterprise; or
 (b) there were one or more *adjustment periods for the deceased person&#39;s acquisition or importation of the asset, and the last of those adjustment periods has ended before the cancellation of your *registration takes effect.
Section 139-10 Attributing adjustments for distributions from deceased estates
 (1) An *adjustment that you have under this Division is attributable to the tax period in which it arises.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  29-20 (which is about attributing your adjustments).
Section 139-15 Application of Division 129
  This Division does not affect the operation of Division  129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose).
Section 141-1 What this Division is about
The holder of a tradex order has an increasing adjustment if goods relating to that order are dealt with contrary to the Tradex Scheme.
Note: GST would not have been payable on importation of the goods under the Tradex Scheme: see section  42-5.
Section 141-5 Adjustments for applying goods contrary to the Tradex Scheme
 (1) You have an increasing adjustment if:
 (a) you import *tradex scheme goods; and
 (b) you are the holder (within the meaning of the Tradex Scheme Act 1999) of the *tradex order relating to the goods; and
 (c) the importation would have been a *taxable importation if the goods had not been covered by item 21A of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 at the time of their entry for home consumption under the Customs Act 1901; and
 (d) any of the circumstances referred to in subsection  21(1) of that Act occur in respect of any of the goods.
However, the increasing adjustment only arises in relation to the first occurrence of such a circumstance following an importation of the goods.
 (2) The amount of the *increasing adjustment is the difference between:
 (a) the amount of GST that would have been payable on the importation if the importation had been a *taxable importation; and
 (b) the amount (if any) of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled for the importation if the importation had been a taxable importation.
Section 141-10 Meaning of tradex scheme goods etc.
 (1) Tradex scheme goods are imported goods that:
 (a) are nominated goods (within the meaning of the Tradex Scheme Act 1999) in relation to a *tradex order; and
 (b) were covered by item  21A in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 at the time of their entry for home consumption under the Customs Act 1901.
 (2) Tradex order has the meaning given by section 4 of the Tradex Scheme Act 1999.
Section 141-15 Attribution of adjustments under this Division
 (1) An adjustment under this Division is attributable to the tax period in which the adjustment arises.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  29-20 (which is about attributing your adjustments).
Section 141-20 Application of Division 129
  This Division does not affect the operation of Division  129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose).
Table of Subdivisions
Section 142-A Excess GST unrelated to adjustments
Section 142-B GST related to cancelled supplies
Section 142-C Passed-on GST
Section 142-1 What this Division is about
Excess GST is not to be refunded if this would give an entity a windfall gain.
Note: Refunding excess GST to a supplier will give it a windfall gain if it has already passed on the excess GST in the price of the supply (and not reimbursed the recipient).
Section 142-5 When this Subdivision applies
 (1) This Subdivision applies if, after disregarding any amounts covered by subsection  (2), your *assessed net amount for a tax period takes into account an amount of GST exceeding that which is payable.
Note: This Subdivision applies whether or not you have paid, or been refunded, the assessed net amount.
Example: Sunny Co mistakenly reports a negative net amount of $4,000 made up of GST of $10,000 less input tax credits of $14,000. In fact, Sunny Co&#39;s GST should have been $8,000 making its negative net amount $6,000. Sunny Co has excess GST of $2,000.
 (2) Disregard the following amounts:
 (a) an amount of GST that was correctly payable and attributable to the tax period, but which later becomes the subject of a *decreasing adjustment;
 (b) an amount of GST that is payable, but is correctly attributable to a different tax period;
 (c) an amount of GST to which section  142-16 (about low value goods) applies.
Section 142-10 Refunding the excess GST
  For the purposes of each *taxation law, so much of the excess from subsection 142-5(1) (the excess GST) as you have *passed on to another entity is taken to have always been:
 (a) payable; and
 (b) on a *taxable supply;
until you reimburse the other entity for the passed-on GST.
Note 1: If you reimburse the passed-on GST so that this section ceases to apply there will be an adjustment event under paragraph  19-10(1)(b) or (c). You will have a decreasing adjustment (see section 19-55) and the other entity may have an increasing adjustment (see section  19-80).
Note 2: Any excess GST you have not passed on will be refunded as described in section  155-75 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.
Note 3: While this section applies, paragraph 11-5(b) (about taxable supplies) is satisfied for the corresponding acquisition by the other entity.
Section 142-15 When section 142 - 10 does not apply
Commissioner satisfied it is inappropriate for that section to apply
 (1) Treat section  142-10 as never having applied to the extent that the Commissioner is satisfied that:
 (a) applying that section would be inconsistent with the principle that excess GST is not to be refunded if this would give an entity a windfall gain; and
 (b) you have requested a decision under this subsection in the *approved form.
Note: Refusing to make the requested decision is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (2) The Commissioner must notify you in writing of any decision relating to you made under subsection  (1).
If there never was a supply
 (3) Treat section  142-10 as never having applied to the extent that:
 (a) you treated the excess GST as payable on a supply, but in fact there never was a supply; and
 (b) you reimburse the other entity for the *passed-on GST.
Note: If you reimburse the passed-on GST, you will be refunded an equivalent amount as described in section  155-75 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.
So far as it relates to your creditable acquisitions
 (4) Section 142-10 does not apply for the purposes of applying subsection  11-15(2) (about creditable purpose) to you.
If the recipient knows you have not paid the excess GST
 (5) Section 142-10 does not apply for the purposes of applying a *taxation law to the other entity if, and while, that other entity knows, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that you have not paid the excess GST to the Commissioner.
Note: Section 142-10 still applies for the purposes of applying taxation laws to you.
Section 142-16 No refund of excess GST relating to supplies treated as non - taxable importations
 (1) This section applies to an amount of GST on a supply (the low value goods GST) that is taken into account in your *assessed net amount for a tax period if:
 (a) you incorrectly treated the low value goods GST as payable on a supply of goods; and
 (b) an importation of the goods was a *taxable importation, but was incorrectly treated as being a *non-taxable importation under section  42-15; and
 (c) the *recipient of the supply is a *consumer of the supply.
 (2) For the purposes of each *taxation law, the low value goods GST is taken to have always been payable on a *taxable supply until:
 (a) to the extent (if any) that you have *passed on the GST to another entity--you reimburse the other entity for the passed on GST; and
 (b) an entity provides to you a declaration or information that indicates that GST has been paid on the *taxable importation.
Section 142-20 Refunding GST relating to cancelled supplies
 (1) This section applies if:
 (a) your *assessed net amount for a tax period takes into account an amount of GST on a supply; and
 (b) you have a *decreasing adjustment attributable to a later tax period as a result of the cancellation of the supply.
 (2) Reduce:
 (a) your *decreasing adjustment; and
 (b) if the *recipient of the supply has a corresponding *increasing adjustment--the recipient&#39;s increasing adjustment;
to the extent that you have *passed on that GST to the recipient, but not reimbursed the recipient for the passed-on GST.
 (3) This section has effect despite sections  19-55 (about decreasing adjustments for supplies) and 19-80 (about increasing adjustments for acquisitions).
Section 142-25 Working out if GST has been passed on
 (1) Some or all of an amount of GST may have been passed on to another entity even if:
 (a) a *tax invoice is not issued to or by that other entity; or
 (b) a tax invoice issued to or by that other entity relates to that GST, but does not contain enough information to enable that GST to be clearly ascertained.
 (2) If:
 (a) you issue a *tax invoice or a notice under section 84-89 to another entity, or another entity issues a *recipient created tax invoice to you; and
 (b) the invoice or notice contains enough information to enable some or all of an amount of GST to be clearly ascertained; and
 (c) in a case where you must pay the *assessed net amount for a tax period to which the invoice or notice relates--you have paid that assessed net amount to the Commissioner;
the invoice or notice is prima facie evidence of that part of that GST having *passed on to that other entity.
Note: The special rules in this Part mainly modify the operation of Part 2-5, but they may affect other Parts of Chapter  2 in minor ways.
Section 144-1 What this Division is about
Taxi operators are required to be registered, regardless of turnover.
Section 144-5 Requirement to register
 (1) You are required to be registered if, in *carrying on your enterprise, you supply *taxi travel.
 (2) It does not matter whether:
 (a) your *GST turnover meets the *registration turnover threshold; or
 (b) in *carrying on your enterprise, you make other supplies besides supplies of *taxi travel.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  23-5 (which is about who is required to be registered).
Section 146-1 What this Division is about
Non-residents may elect to be limited registration entities. Limited registration entities are not entitled to input tax credits for acquisitions and importations, and must have quarterly tax periods.
Note: The Commissioner may approve simpler approved forms for limited registration entities: see subsection  388-50(3) in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.
Section 146-5 Limited registration entities
 (1) You are a limited registration entity for a tax period applying to you if an election under subsection (2) is in effect for you during the period.
Electing to be a limited registration entity
 (2) You may, by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form, make an election under this subsection if you are a *non-resident who:
 (a) makes, or intends to make, one or more supplies that are:
 (i) *inbound intangible consumer supplies; or
 (ii) *offshore supplies of low value goods that were, or would be, *connected with the indirect tax zone, solely because of Subdivision  84-C; or
 (b) is, or intends to become, a *redeliverer of *offshore supplies of low value goods.
When an election is in effect
 (3) The election:
 (a) takes effect from the start of the tax period you nominate in the election; and
 (b) if your *registration is cancelled and the date of effect of the cancellation occurs after the start of that tax period--ceases to have effect on the date of effect of the cancellation; and
 (c) if paragraph (b) does not apply and, under subsection  (5), you revoke the election--ceases to have effect at the start of your first tax period to start after the revocation.
 (4) However, the election never takes effect if your *registration is cancelled and the date of effect of the cancellation occurs on or before the start of the tax period you nominate in the election.
Revoking an election
 (5) You may, by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form, revoke an election under subsection (2).
 (6) However, subsection  (5) does not apply if you have been notified that the Commissioner has decided to cancel your *registration (whether or not the cancellation has already taken effect).
Section 146-10 Limited registration entities cannot make creditable acquisitions
 (1) An acquisition made by a *limited registration entity is not a *creditable acquisition if an election under subsection  146-5(2) is in effect for the entity when the acquisition is made.
 (2) However, subsection  (1) does not apply, and is taken never to have applied, to the acquisition if you revoke the election under subsection 146-5(5) during:
 (a) the *financial year in which the acquisition is made; or
 (b) the next financial year.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  11-5 (which is about what is a creditable acquisition).
Section 146-15 Limited registration entities cannot make creditable importations
 (1) An importation made by a *limited registration entity is not a *creditable importation if an election under subsection  146-5(2) is in effect for the entity when the importation is made.
 (2) However, subsection  (1) does not apply, and is taken never to have applied, to the importation if you revoke the election under subsection 146-5(5) during:
 (a) the *financial year in which the importation is made; or
 (b) the next financial year.
 (3) This section has effect despite section  15-5 (which is about what is a creditable importation).
Section 146-20 Entries in the Australian Business Register
 (1) Subsection 25-10(2) does not apply if:
 (a) you become *registered; and
 (b) on the date your registration takes or took effect, you are a *limited registration entity.
Note: Under subsection 25-10(2), the Australian Business Registrar would otherwise be required to enter that date in the Australian Business Register.
 (2) However, if:
 (a) you cease to be a *limited registration entity at a time when you are *registered; and
 (b) because of subsection  (1) of this section, subsection 25-10(2) did not apply to your registration;
subsection 25-10(2) is taken to apply from the time you cease to be a limited registration entity.
 (3) Subsection 25-60(2) does not apply if:
 (a) your *registration is cancelled; and
 (b) because of subsection  (1) of this section, the date on which your registration took effect was not entered in the *Australian Business Register; and
 (c) immediately before the cancellation took effect, you were a *limited registration entity.
Note: Under subsection 25-60(2), the Australian Business Registrar would otherwise be required to enter that date in the Australian Business Register.
Section 146-25 Limited registration entities have only quarterly tax periods
 (1) If you are a *limited registration entity, you cannot make an election under section 27-10, and the Commissioner cannot determine your tax periods under section  27-15 or 27-37.
Note: Sections 27-10 and 27-15 provide for each individual month to be a tax period. Section  27-37 provides for 12 complete tax periods in each year.
 (2) An election by you under section  27-10 or a determination under section 27-15 or 27-37 in relation to you is taken not to be in force at any time during which you are a *limited registration entity.
 (3) This section has effect despite sections  27-10, 27-15 and 27-37 (which are about one month tax periods).
Section 149-1 What this Division is about

 (3) The Commissioner must *register the government entity whether or not the Commissioner is satisfied that it is *carrying on an *enterprise or intending to carry on an enterprise.
 (4) This section has effect despite section  23-10 (which is about who may be registered) and modifies the effect of section 25-5 (which is about when the Commissioner must register an entity).
Section 149-10 Government entities are not required to be registered
 (1) A *government entity is not *required to be registered even if:

Section 151-A Electing to have annual tax periods
Section 151-B Consequences of electing to have annual tax periods
Section 151-1 What this Division is about
In some cases, you may elect to have annual tax periods. You will then lodge GST returns, and pay amounts of GST or receive refunds of GST, on an annual basis (which better matches your obligation to lodge an income tax return).
Section 151-5 Eligibility to make an annual tax period election
 (1) You are eligible to make an *annual tax period election if:
 (a) you are not *required to be registered; and
 (b) you have not made any election under section  162-15 to pay GST by instalments (other than such an election that is no longer in effect).
 (2) However, you are not eligible to make an *annual tax period election if the only reason you are not *required to be registered is because you disregarded supplies under paragraph  188-15(3)(b) or 188-20(3)(b) (which are about supplies of rights or options offshore).
Section 151-10 Making an annual tax period election
 (1) You may, by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form, make an *annual tax period election if you are eligible under section  151-5.
 (2) Your election takes effect from:
 (a) the start of the earliest tax period for which, on the day on which you make your election, your *GST return is not yet due (taking into account any further period the Commissioner allows under paragraph  31-8(1)(b) or 31-10(1)(b)); or
 (b) the start of such other tax period as the Commissioner allows, in accordance with a request you make in the *approved form.
Note: Refusing a request to allow your election to take effect from the start of another tax period is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
Section 151-15 Annual tax period elections by representative members of GST groups
 (1) A *representative member of a *GST group cannot make an *annual tax period election unless each *member of the GST group is eligible under section 151-5.
 (2) If the *representative member makes such an election, the *annual tax period applying to the representative member also applies to each member.
Section 151-20 When you must make your annual tax period election
 (1) You must make your *annual tax period election:
 (a) if the tax periods applying to you are *quarterly tax periods--on or before 28 October in the *financial year to which it relates; or

 (2) However:
 (a) if:
 (i) during the *financial year but after 28 October in that financial year, you became eligible under section 151-5 to make an *annual tax period election; and
 (ii) this subsection had not applied to you before; and
 (iii) your *current GST lodgment record is not more than 6 months; or
 (b) if the financial year started on 1  July 2004 and the Commissioner determines in writing that this paragraph applies;
you must make your election on or before the first day, after becoming eligible under section 151-5 or after the Commissioner&#39;s determination, on which you would, but for this Division, be required to give a *GST return to the Commissioner.
 (3) The Commissioner may, in accordance with a request you make in the *approved form, allow you to make your election on a specified day occurring after the day provided for under subsection (1) or (2).
Note: Refusing a request to be allowed to make an election on a specified day under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
Section 151-25 Duration of an annual tax period election
General rule
 (1) Your election ceases to have effect if:
 (a) you revoke it by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form; or

Your election also ceases to have effect at the end of your tax period under subsection 27-39(1), at the end of your concluding tax period under section  27-40, or at the end of a tax period applying to you to which subsection 151-55(1) applies.
Revocation

Disallowance
 (3) The Commissioner may disallow your election if, and only if, the Commissioner is satisfied that you have failed to comply with one or more of your obligations under a *taxation law.
Note: Disallowing your election is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
 (4) A disallowance of your election is taken to have had effect:
 (a) if the Commissioner notifies you of the disallowance during the *financial year in which your election first took effect--from the start of the tax period in which it first took effect; or
 (b) if the Commissioner notifies you of the disallowance on or before 28  October during a later financial year--from the start of that later financial year; or

Section 151-40 Annual tax periods
 (1) While an *annual tax period election that you have made has effect, each *financial year is a tax period that applies to you.
 (2) However, if your *annual tax period election takes effect on a day that is not the start of a *financial year, the period from when your annual tax period election takes effect until the end of the financial year in which it takes effect is a tax period that applies to you.
 (3) A tax period under this section is an annual tax period.
 (4) This section has effect despite sections  27-5, 27-10 and 27-30 (which are about tax periods).
Section 151-45 When GST returns for annual tax periods must be given
 (1) You must give your *GST return for an *annual tax period to the Commissioner:
 (a) if you are required under section  161 of the *ITAA 1936 to lodge a return in relation to a year of income corresponding to, or ending during, an annual tax period applying to you--within:
 (i) the period, specified in the instrument made under that section, for you to lodge as required under that section; or
 (ii) such further time as the Commissioner has permitted for you to lodge as required under that section; or
 (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--on or before the 28  February following the end of the annual tax period.
Note: Section 388-55 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 allows the Commissioner to defer the time for giving the GST return.
 (2) This section has effect despite sections  31-8 and 31-10 (which are about when GST returns must be given).
Section 151-50 When payments of assessed net amounts for annual tax periods must be made
 (1) If the *assessed net amount for an *annual tax period applying to you is greater than zero, you must pay the assessed net amount to the Commissioner on or before the day on which, under section  151-45, you are required to give to the Commissioner your *GST return for the annual tax period.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  33-5 (which is about when payments of assessed net amounts must be made).
Section 151-55 An entity&#39;s concluding annual tax period
 (1) If any of the following occurs:
 (a) an entity who is an individual dies;
 (b) an entity ceases to *carry on any *enterprise;
 (c) an entity&#39;s *registration is cancelled;
during an *annual tax period applying to the entity, the annual tax period is not affected by the death, cessation or cancellation.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  27-40 (which is about an entity&#39;s concluding tax period).
 (3) However, this section does not affect the application of:
 (a) section 27-39; or
 (b) if an entity for any reason ceases to exist--section  27-40.
Section 151-60 The effect of incapacitation or cessation
 (1) If an entity becomes an *incapacitated entity, or the entity for any reason ceases to exist, the entity must give the *GST return, for the *annual tax period that ends as a result, to the Commissioner:

 (b) within such further period as the Commissioner allows.
 (2) If the *assessed net amount for the *annual tax period is greater than zero, the entity must pay the assessed net amount to the Commissioner on or before the 21st day of the month following the end of the annual tax period.

This Division sets out the rules for holding and issuing tax invoices and adjustment notes when your supplies or acquisitions are made through an agent, or when insurance is supplied through an insurance broker. It also allows in some cases a supply or acquisition made through, or facilitated by, an entity on your behalf to be treated as 2 separate supplies or acquisitions.
Section 153-5 Attributing the input tax credits for your creditable acquisitions
 (1) If:
 (a) you are entitled to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition made through an agent; and
 (b) neither you nor your agent holds a *tax invoice for the acquisition when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the input tax credit on the acquisition would otherwise be attributable;
then:
 (c) the input tax credit (including any part of the input tax credit) is not attributable to that tax period; and
 (d) the input tax credit (or the part of the input tax credit) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you or your agent holds that tax invoice.
 (2) This section has effect despite subsection  29-10(3) (which is about the requirement to hold a tax invoice).
Section 153-10 Attributing your adjustments
 (1) If:
 (a) you have a *decreasing adjustment relating to a supply made by you through an agent or made to you through an agent; and
 (b) neither you nor your agent holds an *adjustment note or *third party adjustment note for the adjustment when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the adjustment would otherwise be attributable;
then:
 (c) the adjustment (including any part of the adjustment) is not attributable to that tax period; and
 (d) the adjustment (or the part of the adjustment) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you or your agent holds that adjustment note or third party adjustment note.
 (2) This section has effect despite subsections  29-20(3) (which is about the requirement to hold an adjustment note) and 134-15(1) (which is about the requirement to hold a third party adjustment note).
Section 153-15 Tax invoices
 (1) If you make a *taxable supply through an agent, an obligation to issue a *tax invoice relating to the supply:
 (a) arises whether the *recipient makes a request for a tax invoice to you or the agent; and
 (b) is complied with if either you or the agent gives the recipient a tax invoice within 28 days after the request.
 (2) However, you and the agent must not both issue separate *tax invoices relating to the supply.
Note: If Subdivision 153-B is to apply to the supply, there will be an arrangement under which only your agent can issue the tax invoice: see paragraph  153-50(1)(d).
 (3) This section has effect despite section  29-70 (which is about tax invoices).
Section 153-20 Adjustment notes
 (1) If you have a *decreasing adjustment relating to a supply made by you through an agent or made to you through an agent, an obligation under subsection 29-75(2) to issue an *adjustment note for the adjustment, or an obligation under subsection 134-20(2) to issue a *third party adjustment note for the adjustment:
 (a) arises whether the *recipient makes a request for an adjustment note or a third party adjustment note to you or the agent; and
 (b) is complied with if either you or your agent gives the recipient an adjustment note or a third party adjustment note within 28 days after the request.
 (2) However, you and the agent must not both issue separate *adjustment notes or *third party adjustment notes for the adjustment.
 (3) This section has effect despite sections  29-75 (which is about adjustment notes) and 134-20 (which is about third party adjustment notes).
Section 153-25 Insurance supplied through insurance brokers
 (1) If an insurer supplies an *insurance policy through an *insurance broker acting on behalf of the *recipient of the supply, this Subdivision has effect as if the supply were made through the insurance broker as an agent of the insurer.
 (2) This section does not affect the application of this Subdivision in relation to the acquisition of the *insurance policy through the insurance broker as an agent of the *recipient.
Section 153-50 Arrangements under which intermediaries are treated as suppliers or acquirers
 (1) An entity (the principal) may, in writing, enter into an arrangement with another entity (the intermediary) under which:
 (a) the intermediary will, on the principal&#39;s behalf, do any or all of the following:
 (i) make supplies to third parties;
 (ii) facilitate supplies to third parties (including by issuing *invoices relating to, or receiving *consideration for, such supplies);
 (iii) make acquisitions from third parties;
 (iv) facilitate acquisitions from third parties (including by providing consideration for such acquisitions); and
 (b) the kinds of supplies or acquisitions, or the kinds of supplies and acquisitions, to which the arrangement applies are specified; and
 (c) for the purposes of the GST law:
 (i) the intermediary will be treated as making the supplies to the third parties, or acquisitions from the third parties, or both; and
 (ii) the principal will be treated as making corresponding supplies to the intermediary, or corresponding acquisitions from the intermediary, or both; and
 (d) in the case of supplies to third parties:
 (i) the intermediary will issue to the third parties, in the intermediary&#39;s own name, all the *tax invoices and *adjustment notes relating to those supplies; and
 (ii) the principal will not issue to the third parties any tax invoices and adjustment notes relating to those supplies; and
 (e) the arrangement ceases to have effect if the principal or the intermediary, or both of them, cease to be *registered.
 (2) For the purposes of subsection  (1), an entity can be an intermediary whether or not the entity is the agent of the principal.
Section 153-55 The effect of these arrangements on supplies
 (1) A *taxable supply that the principal makes to a third party through the intermediary is taken to be a supply that is a taxable supply made by the intermediary to the third party, and not by the principal, if:
 (a) the supply is of a kind to which the arrangement applies; and
 (b) the supply is made in accordance with the arrangement; and
 (c) both the principal and the intermediary are *registered.
 (2) In addition, the principal is taken to make a supply that is a *taxable supply to the intermediary. This supply is taken:
 (a) to be a supply of the same thing as is supplied in the taxable supply (the intermediary&#39;s supply) that the intermediary is taken to make; and
 (b) to have a *value equal to 10/11 of the amount that is payable to the principal by the intermediary in respect of the intermediary&#39;s supply.
The intermediary is taken to make a corresponding *creditable acquisition from the principal.
 (3) If the principal pays, or is liable to pay, an amount, as a commission or similar payment, to the intermediary for the intermediary&#39;s supply to the third party:
 (a) for the purpose of paragraph  (2)(b), the amount payable by the intermediary to the principal is taken to be reduced by the amount the principal pays, or is liable to pay, to the intermediary; and
 (b) the supply by the intermediary to the principal, to which the principal&#39;s payment or liability relates, is not a *taxable supply.
 (4) However, this section no longer applies, and is taken never to have applied, if the principal issues to the third party, in the principal&#39;s own name, any *tax invoice or *adjustment note relating to the supply.
 (4A) Without limiting subsection  (4), this section does not apply in relation to a supply to which section 84-55 or section 84-81 applies.
Note: These sections treat an operator of an electronic distribution platform, or a goods redeliverer, as having made the supply.
 (5) This section has effect despite section  9-5 (which is about what are taxable supplies), section 9-75 (which is about the value of taxable supplies) and section  11-5 (which is about what are creditable acquisitions).
Section 153-60 The effect of these arrangements on acquisitions
 (1) An acquisition that the principal makes from a third party through the intermediary is taken to be a *creditable acquisition made by the intermediary from the third party, and not by the principal, if:
 (a) the acquisition is of a kind to which the arrangement applies; and
 (b) the acquisition is made in accordance with the arrangement; and
 (c) both the principal and the intermediary are *registered.
 (2) In addition, the intermediary is taken to make a supply that is a *taxable supply to the principal. This supply is taken:
 (a) to be a supply of the same thing as is acquired in the *creditable acquisition (the intermediary&#39;s acquisition) that the intermediary is taken to make; and
 (b) to have a *value equal to 10/11 of the amount that is payable to the intermediary by the principal in respect of the intermediary&#39;s acquisition.
The principal is taken to make a corresponding acquisition from the intermediary, and the acquisition is taken to be a creditable acquisition if, apart from this section, the principal&#39;s acquisition from the third party would have been a creditable acquisition.
 (3) If the principal pays, or is liable to pay, an amount, as a commission or similar payment, to the intermediary for the intermediary&#39;s acquisition from the third party:
 (a) for the purpose of paragraph  (2)(b), the amount payable by the principal to the intermediary is taken to be increased by the amount the principal pays, or is liable to pay, to the intermediary; and
 (b) the supply by the intermediary to the principal, to which the principal&#39;s payment or liability relates, is not a *taxable supply.
 (3A) This section does not apply in relation to an acquisition if section  84-55 applies to the supply to which the acquisition relates.
Note: Under section 84-55, an inbound intangible consumer supply, or an offshore supply of low value goods, made through an electronic distribution platform (or a supply that is taken to be such a supply because of section  84-60) is treated as having been made by the operator of the platform.
 (4) This section has effect despite section  11-5 (which is about what are creditable acquisitions), section 11-10 (which is about what are acquisitions), section  9-5 (which is about what are taxable supplies) and section 9-75 (which is about the value of taxable supplies).
Section 153-65 Determinations that supplies or acquisitions are taken to be under these arrangements
 (1) The Commissioner may determine in writing that:
 (a) supplies of a specified kind to third parties that any entity (the intermediary) makes or facilitates (including by issuing *invoices relating to, or receiving *consideration for, such supplies) on behalf of any other entity (the principal); or
 (b) acquisitions of a specified kind from third parties that any entity (the intermediary) makes or facilitates (including by providing consideration for such acquisitions) on behalf of any other entity (the principal);
are taken to be supplies or acquisitions that are of a kind to which an arrangement of a kind referred to in section 153-50 applies, and that are made in accordance with that arrangement.
 (2) The determination has effect accordingly, unless either the intermediary or the principal notifies the other in writing, or both notify each other in writing, that:
 (a) any supplies to third parties that the intermediary makes or facilitates (including by issuing *invoices relating to, or receiving *consideration for, such supplies) on the principal&#39;s behalf are not supplies to which such an arrangement applies; and
 (b) any acquisitions from third parties that the intermediary makes or facilitates (including by providing consideration for such acquisitions) on the principal&#39;s behalf are not acquisitions to which such an arrangement applies.
Section 156-1 What this Division is about
Supplies and acquisitions made for a period or on a progressive basis are treated as separate supplies or acquisitions for some purposes, in particular the attribution rules.
Section 156-5 Attributing the GST on progressive or periodic supplies
 (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply that is made:
 (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and
 (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;
is attributable, in accordance with section 29-5, as if each progressive or periodic component of the supply were a separate supply.
 (2) If the progressive or periodic components of such a supply are not readily identifiable, the components correspond to the proportion of the total *consideration for the supply that the separate amounts of consideration represent.
Section 156-10 Attributing the input tax credits on progressive or periodic acquisitions
 (1) The input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition that is made:
 (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and
 (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;
is attributable, in accordance with section 29-10, as if each progressive or periodic component of the acquisition were a separate acquisition.
 (2) If the progressive or periodic components of such an acquisition are not readily identifiable, the components correspond to the proportion of the total *consideration for the acquisition that the separate amounts of consideration represent.
Section 156-15 Progressive or periodic supplies partly connected with the indirect tax zone
 (1) If:
 (a) a *taxable supply is made for a period or on a progressive basis; and
 (b) the supply is made for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis; and
 (c) the whole of a progressive or periodic component of the supply would not be *connected with the indirect tax zone if it were a separate supply;
that component is treated as if it were a separate supply that is not connected with the indirect tax zone.
 (2) This section has effect despite section  9-25 (which is about when supplies are connected with the indirect tax zone) and Division 96.
Section 156-17 Application of Division 58 to progressive or periodic supplies and acquisitions
 (1) A supply that is made:
 (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and
 (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;
is treated, for the purposes of Division 58 (which is about representatives of incapacitated entities), as if each progressive or periodic component of the supply were a separate supply.
 (2) An acquisition that is made:
 (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and
 (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;
is treated, for the purposes of Division 58 (which is about representatives of incapacitated entities), as if each progressive or periodic component of the acquisition were a separate acquisition.
Section 156-20 Application of Division 129 to progressive or periodic acquisitions
  An acquisition that is made:
 (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and
 (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;
is treated, for the purposes of Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose), as if each progressive or periodic component of the acquisition were a separate acquisition.
Section 156-22 Leases etc. treated as being on a progressive or periodic basis
  For the purposes of this Division, a supply or acquisition by way of lease, hire or similar arrangement is to be treated as a supply or acquisition that is made on a progressive or periodic basis, for the period of the lease, hire or arrangement.
Section 156-23 Certain supplies or acquisitions under hire purchase agreements treated as not on progressive or periodic basis
  For the purposes of this Division, a supply or acquisition of goods or credit under a *hire purchase agreement is treated as not being a supply or acquisition made on a progressive or periodic basis.

  This Division (other than sections  156-15 and 156-17) does not apply if you *account on a cash basis.
Section 157-1 What this Division is about
The choice available to an endorsed charity, gift-deductible entity or government school to account on a cash basis is not restricted as it is for other entities, but other restrictions may apply.
Section 157-5 Charities etc. choosing to account on a cash basis
 (1) An *endorsed charity, a *gift-deductible entity or a *government school may choose to *account on a cash basis, with effect from the first day of the tax period that the endorsed charity or entity chooses.
 (3) This section does not apply in relation to a *gift-deductible entity endorsed as a deductible gift recipient (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) under section  30-120 of the ITAA 1997, unless the entity is:
 (a) an *endorsed charity; or

Section 157-10 Charities etc. ceasing to account on a cash basis
 (1) Paragraphs 29-50(1)(a) and (ab) and subsection  29-50(3) do not apply in relation to any *endorsed charity, any *gift-deductible entity or any *government school.
 (3) This section does not apply in relation to a *gift-deductible entity endorsed as a deductible gift recipient (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) under section  30-120 of the ITAA 1997, unless the entity is:

 (b) a *government school; or
 (c) a fund, authority or institution of a kind referred to in paragraph  30-125(1)(b) of the ITAA 1997.
Note: This subsection excludes from this section certain (but not all) gift-deductible entities that are only endorsed for the operation of a fund, authority or institution.
Section 158-1 What this Division is about
If you account on a cash basis, you are treated as if you do not account on a cash basis for any acquisition made under a hire purchase agreement.
Section 158-5 Treat as not accounting on a cash basis
 (1) This section applies if you *account on a cash basis.
 (2) This Act and the regulations apply in relation to:
 (a) an acquisition you make under a *hire purchase agreement; or
 (b) an input tax credit to which you are entitled, or an *adjustment you have, under subsection 58-10(1) for an acquisition made under a hire purchase agreement;
as if you do not *account on a cash basis.
Section 159-1 What this Division is about
This Division tells you to which tax periods to attribute any supplies and acquisitions that are affected by a change in your accounting basis, and how to treat bad debts if your accounting basis changes.
Section 159-5 Ceasing to account on a cash basis--amounts not previously attributed
 (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply, the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition, or an *adjustment that you have, is attributable to a particular tax period (the transition tax period), and not to any other tax period, if:
 (a) at the start of the transition tax period, you cease to *account on a cash basis; and
 (b) the GST on the supply, the input tax credit on the acquisition, or the adjustment, was not attributable, to any extent, to a previous tax period during which you accounted on a cash basis; and
 (c) it would have been attributable to that previous tax period had you not accounted on a cash basis during that period.
For accounting on a cash basis, see Subdivision 29-B.
Example: In tax period A in the following diagram, you issue an invoice for a supply that you made, but you receive no payment for the supply until tax period D. However, you cease to account on a cash basis at the start of tax period C (which is therefore the transition tax period).
 Under section 29-5, the supply was not attributable to tax period A (because at the time you were accounting on a cash basis), but it would have been attributable to that period if you had not been accounting on a cash basis (because you issued the invoice in that period). Therefore the supply is attributable to tax period C (the transition tax period).
 (2) This section has effect despite sections  29-5, 29-10 and 29-20 (which are about attributing GST on supplies, input tax credits on acquisitions, and adjustments) and any other provisions of this Chapter.
Section 159-10 Ceasing to account on a cash basis--amounts partly attributed
 (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply, the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition, or an *adjustment that you have, is attributable to a particular tax period (the transition tax period), and not to any other tax period, if:
 (a) at the start of the transition tax period, you cease to *account on a cash basis; and
 (b) the GST on the supply, the input tax credit on the acquisition, or the adjustment, was only to some extent attributable to a previous tax period during which you accounted on a cash basis; and
 (c) it would have been attributable solely to that previous tax period had you not accounted on a cash basis during that period.
 (2) However, the GST on the supply, the input tax credit on the acquisition, or the adjustment, is attributable to the transition tax period only to the extent that it has not been previously attributed to one or more of those previous tax periods.
For accounting on a cash basis, see Subdivision 29-B.
Example: Take the example in section 159-5 as changed in the following diagram so that you receive part of the payment for the supply in tax period A. The transition tax period is still tax period C.
 Under section 29-5, the supply was to some extent attributable to tax period A, but it would have been attributable only to that tax period if you had not been accounting on a cash basis. Therefore the supply is attributable to tax period C (the transition tax period), but only to the extent that it is not attributable to tax period A.
 (3) This section has effect despite sections  29-5, 29-10 and 29-20 (which are about attributing GST on supplies, input tax credits on acquisitions, and adjustments) and any other provisions of this Chapter.
Section 159-15 Ceasing to account on a cash basis--bad debts
 (1) If:
 (a) the GST payable by you on a *taxable supply or the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition is attributable to a particular tax period (the transition tax period) under section  159-5 or 159-10; and
 (b) before the start of the transition tax period, the whole or part of a debt relating to the *consideration for the supply or acquisition is written off as bad;
then:
 (c) the amount written off, and any part of that amount recovered before the start of the transition tax period, is to be treated, for the purposes of Division  21, as if at all relevant times you were not *accounting on a cash basis; and
 (d) any adjustment arising under Division  21 as a result is attributable to the transition tax period.
 (2) This section has effect despite subsections  21-5(2) and 21-15(2) (which preclude adjustments for bad debts when accounting on a cash basis) and section  29-20 (which is about attributing adjustments).
Section 159-20 Starting to account on a cash basis
 (1) If, at the start of a tax period, you start to *account on a cash basis, then:
 (a) the GST payable by you on a *taxable supply that you made; or
 (b) the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition; or
 (c) an *adjustment that you have;
that was attributable to one or more previous tax periods remains attributable to those periods, and not to any other tax period.
 (2) This section has effect despite sections  29-5, 29-10 and 29-20 (which are about attributing GST on supplies, input tax credits on acquisitions, and adjustments) and any other provisions of this Chapter.
Section 159-25 Starting to account on a cash basis--bad debts
 (1) If:
 (a) the GST payable by you on a *taxable supply, or the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition, was attributable to a tax period during which you were not *accounting on a cash basis; and
 (b) at a time when you are accounting on a cash basis, the whole or part of a debt relating to the *consideration for the supply or acquisition is written off as bad;
the amount written off, and any part of that amount that is recovered, is to be treated, for the purposes of Division 21, as if at all relevant times you were not accounting on a cash basis.
 (2) This section has effect despite subsections  21-5(2) and 21-15(2) (which preclude adjustments for bad debts when accounting on a cash basis).
Section 159-30 Entities ceasing to exist or coming into existence
  This Division does not apply in relation to an entity ceasing to *account on a cash basis as it ceases to exist, or in relation to an entity starting to account on a cash basis as it comes into existence.
Note: The special rules in this Part mainly modify the operation of Part 2-7, but they may affect other Parts of Chapter  2 in minor ways.

 (b) the start of such other tax period as the Commissioner allows, in accordance with a request you make in the *approved form.
Note: Refusing a request to allow your election to take effect from the start of another tax period is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision  110-F in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).
Section 162-20 Elections by representative members of GST groups
 (1) A *representative member of a *GST group cannot elect to pay GST by instalments unless each *member of the GST group is eligible under section 162-5.

 (b) finishes at the end of the day before which you must, under section  162-110, pay to the Commissioner your *assessed net amount for the *instalment tax period that includes that GST instalment quarter.
Section 162-195 Reduction in penalties if notified instalment amount is less than 25% of annual GST liability
 (1) This section reduces your *GST instalment shortfall, for a *GST instalment quarter of an *instalment tax period applying to you, if:
 (a) you are liable to pay a penalty under section  162-175 or 162-180 for a *GST instalment quarter of an *instalment tax period applying to you; and
 (b) for that or any other GST instalment quarter of an *instalment tax period:
 (i) you have a *notified instalment amount that is less than 25% of your *annual GST liability for the instalment tax period; or
 (ii) you do not have a notified instalment amount, but the Commissioner is satisfied that, if you had such a notified instalment amount, it would be less than 25% of your annual GST liability for the instalment tax period.
 (2) The *GST instalment shortfall is reduced by the amount worked out as follows:
where:
"notified and other amounts" is the sum of:
 (a) the *notified instalment amount, or, if you do not have a notified instalment amount for the *GST instalment quarter, the amount that the Commissioner is satisfied would have otherwise been that notified instalment amount; and
 (b) for each of the earlier GST instalment quarters (if any) of the *instalment tax period in question:
 (i) the notified instalment amount; or
 (ii) if you do not have a notified instalment amount for the *GST instalment quarter--the amount that the Commissioner is satisfied would have otherwise been that notified instalment amount; and
 (c) if the instalment tax period is only part of a *financial year--your *early net amounts for the financial year (subtracting any of those amounts that are less than zero).
 (3) If, because of the reduction, your *GST instalment shortfall for the *GST instalment quarter is zero or less than zero, you are not liable to pay a penalty under section  162-175 or 162-180 (as the case requires) in relation to the GST instalment quarter.
 (4) If both this section and section  162-200 apply to a particular *GST instalment shortfall, apply this section to the shortfall before applying section  162-200.
Section 162-200 Reduction in penalties if GST instalment shortfall is made up in a later instalment
 (1) This section reduces your *GST instalment shortfall, for a *GST instalment quarter of an *instalment tax period applying to you, if:
 (a) you pay to the Commissioner a *GST instalment for a later GST instalment quarter of the instalment tax period; and
 (b) that GST instalment exceeds 25% of your *annual GST liability for the instalment tax period.
The amount of that excess is called the top up.
 (2) The *GST instalment shortfall is reduced by applying so much of the top up as does not exceed the GST instalment shortfall.
 (3) However, if some of the top up has already been applied (under any other application or applications of this section) to reduce a *GST instalment shortfall for a different *GST instalment quarter of the *instalment tax period, the GST instalment shortfall is reduced by applying so much of the top up as has not already been applied, and does not exceed the GST instalment shortfall.
 (4) The reduction under subsection  (2) has effect for each day in the period that:
 (a) started at the beginning of the day on which you paid the *GST instalment for the later *GST instalment quarter; and
 (b) finishes at the end of the day before which you must, under section  162-110, pay to the Commissioner your *assessed net amount for the *instalment tax period.
Section 162-205 This Subdivision does not create a liability for general interest charge
  For the avoidance of doubt, this Subdivision does not have the effect of making you liable to pay the *general interest charge.
Table of Subdivisions
Section 165-A Application of this Division
Section 165-B Commissioner may negate effects of schemes for GST benefits
Section 165-1 What this Division is about
The object of this Division is to deter schemes to give entities benefits by reducing GST, increasing refunds or altering the timing of payment of GST or refunds.If the dominant purpose or principal effect of a scheme is to give an entity such a benefit, the Commissioner may negate the benefit an entity gets from the scheme by declaring how much GST or refund would have been payable, and when it would have been payable, apart from the scheme.This Division is aimed at artificial or contrived schemes. It is not, for example, intended to apply to:&bull;  an exporter electing to have monthly tax periods in order to bring forward the entitlement to input tax credits; or&bull;  a supplier of child care applying to be approved under the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 (this would make the supplies of child care GST-free); or&bull;  a supplier choosing under section  9-25 of the Wine Tax Act to use the average wholesale price method for working out the taxable value of retail sales of grape wine; or&bull;  a bank having its car fleet serviced earlier than usual, and before 1  July 2000, so that the servicing does not, at least initially, bear the GST.
Section 165-5 When does this Division operate?
General rule
 (1) This Division operates if:
 (a) an entity (the avoider) gets or got a *GST benefit from a *scheme; and
 (b) the GST benefit is not attributable to the making, by any entity, of a choice, election, application or agreement that is expressly provided for by the *GST law, the *wine tax law or the *luxury car tax law; and
 (c) taking account of the matters described in section  165-15, it is reasonable to conclude that either:
 (i) an entity that (whether alone or with others) entered into or carried out the scheme, or part of the scheme, did so with the sole or dominant purpose of that entity or another entity getting a *GST benefit from the scheme; or
 (ii) the principal effect of the scheme, or of part of the scheme, is that the avoider gets the GST benefit from the scheme directly or indirectly; and
 (d) the scheme:
 (i) is a scheme that has been or is entered into on or after 2  December 1998; or
 (ii) is a scheme that has been or is carried out or commenced on or after that day (other than a scheme that was entered into before that day).
Territorial application
 (2) It does not matter whether the *scheme, or any part of the scheme, was entered into or carried out inside or outside Australia.

 &iuml;&#130;&middot; the headings to the sections and subsections of this Act;
 &iuml;&#130;&middot; the headings for groups of sections of this Act (group headings);
 &iuml;&#130;&middot; the notes and examples (however described) that follow provisions of this Act.
 (2) The asterisks used to identify defined terms form part of this Act. However, if a term is not identified by an asterisk, disregard that fact in deciding whether or not to apply to that term a definition or other interpretation provision.
Section 182-5 What does not form part of this Act
  These do not form part of this Act:
 &iuml;&#130;&middot; footnotes and endnotes;
 &iuml;&#130;&middot; Tables of Subdivisions.
Section 182-10 Explanatory sections, and their role in interpreting this Act
 (1) An explanatory section is:
 (a) any section that is the first section in a Division and that has as its heading &quot;What this Division is about&quot;; or
 (b) any section in Chapter  1 (other than sections 1-1 and 1-2); or
 (c) any section in Division  5 or 37; or
 (d) any section that is the last section in a Division or Subdivision of Chapter  2 and that has a checklist of special rules in Chapter 4; or
 (e) any section that a note states to be an explanatory section.
 (2) Explanatory sections form part of this Act, but they are not operative provisions. In interpreting an operative provision, an explanatory section may only be considered:
 (a) in determining the purpose or object underlying the provision; or
 (b) to confirm that the provision&#39;s meaning is the ordinary meaning conveyed by its text, taking into account its context in this Act and the purpose or object underlying the provision; or
 (c) in determining the provision&#39;s meaning if the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or
 (d) in determining the provision&#39;s meaning if the ordinary meaning conveyed by its text, taking into account its context in this Act and the purpose or object underlying the provision, leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.
Section 182-15 Schedules 1, 2 and 3
  The second columns of the tables in Schedules  1, 2 and 3 are not operative. In interpreting an item in those tables, or any other operative provision, those columns may only be considered for a purpose for which an *explanatory section may be considered under subsection 182-10(2).
Section 184-1 Entities
 (1) Entity means any of the following:
 (a) an individual;
 (b) a body corporate;
 (c) a corporation sole;
 (d) a body politic;
 (e) a *partnership;
 (f) any other unincorporated association or body of persons;
 (g) a trust;
 (h) a *superannuation fund.
Note: The term entity is used in a number of different but related senses. It covers all kinds of legal persons. It also covers groups of legal persons, and other things, that in practice are treated as having a separate identity in the same way as a legal person does.
 (1A) Paragraph (1)(f) does not include a *non-entity joint venture.
 (2) The trustee of a trust or of a *superannuation fund is taken to be an entity consisting of the person who is the trustee, or the persons who are the trustees, at any given time.
Note 1: This is because a right or obligation cannot be conferred or imposed on an entity that is not a legal person.
Note 2: The entity that is the trustee of a trust or fund does not change merely because of a change in the person who is the trustee of the trust or fund, or persons who are the trustees of the trust or fund.
 (3) A legal person can have a number of different capacities in which the person does things. In each of those capacities, the person is taken to be a different entity.
Example: In addition to his or her personal capacity, an individual may be:
&iuml;&#130;&middot; sole trustee of one or more trusts; and
&iuml;&#130;&middot; one of a number of trustees of a further trust.
 In his or her personal capacity, he or she is one entity. As trustee of each trust, he or she is a different entity. The trustees of the further trust are a different entity again, of which the individual is a member.
 (4) If a provision refers to an entity of a particular kind, it refers to the entity in its capacity as that kind of entity, not to that entity in any other capacity.
Example: A provision that refers to a company does not cover a company in a capacity as trustee, unless it also refers to a trustee.
Note: For GST purposes, non-profit sub-entities are treated as entities (see Division  63), and government entities can be treated as entities (see Division 149).
Section 184-5 Supplies etc. by partnerships and other unincorporated bodies
 (1) For the avoidance of doubt, a supply, acquisition or importation made by or on behalf of a partner of a *partnership in his or her capacity as a partner:
 (a) is taken to be a supply, acquisition or importation made by the partnership; and
 (b) is not taken to be a supply, acquisition or importation made by that partner or any other partner of the partnership.
Note: Section 444-30 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 deals with the liability of partners for the obligations imposed on a partnership under the GST law.
 (2) For the avoidance of doubt, a supply, acquisition or importation made by or on behalf of one or more members of the committee of management of an unincorporated association or body of persons (other than a *partnership), in their capacity as members of that committee:
 (a) is taken to be a supply, acquisition or importation made by the body; and
 (b) is not taken to be a supply, acquisition or importation made by any members of the association or body.
Note: Section 444-5 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 deals with the liability of members of committees of management for the obligations imposed on an unincorporated association or body of persons under the GST law.
Section 188-1 What this Division is about
In some important respects, the way that this Act applies to you depends on your GST turnover. There are several turnover thresholds, and whether your GST turnover meets a particular turnover threshold, or whether it does not exceed a particular turnover threshold , can determine how this Act applies to you.
Section 188-5 Explanation of the turnover thresholds
  This table specifies the turnover thresholds and indicates how they affect the operation of this Act.
Turnover thresholdsItemThis turnover threshold ...Is relevant to working out:1Registration turnover thresholdwhether you are required to be registered (see section 23-5).2Tax period turnover thresholdwhether tax periods must be monthly (see section 27-15).3Cash accounting turnover thresholdwhether you can elect to account on a cash basis (see section 29-40)4Electronic lodgment turnover thresholdwhether you must lodge GST returns electronically (see section 31-25);whether you must pay amounts of GST electronically (see section 33-10).4AASmall enterprise turnover thresholdwhether you can choose to apply a simplified accounting method as a small enterprise entity (see section 123-7)4AAnnual apportionment turnover thresholdwhether you can make an annual apportionment election (see subsection 131-5(2))5Instalment turnover thresholdwhether you can elect to pay GST by instalments (see subsection 162-5(2))
Note 1: The provisions referred to in the table indicate if the issue in relation to the turnover threshold in question is whether the threshold is met, or whether the threshold is not exceeded.
Note 2: Items 3, 4A and 5 of the table apply to you only if you do not carry on a business.
