          Principal Act, and
          (c) in the case of all residential land owned by the
          foreign person at midnight on 31 December in the years 2022
          and 2023--4% of that taxable value as assessed under the
          Principal Act, and
          (d) in the case of all residential land owned by the
          foreign person at midnight on 31 December in any other
          year, commencing with 2024--5% of that taxable value as
          assessed under the Principal Act.
     (3) Surcharge land tax is payable in addition to any land tax payable
     in respect of the residential land under the other provisions of this
     Act, and is so payable even if no land tax is payable under those
     other provisions.
     (4) The Principal Act applies to surcharge land tax in respect of
     residential land owned by a foreign person subject to the following--
          (a) surcharge land tax is payable as if the residential
          land were the only land owned by the foreign person,
          (b) if the residential land is also owned by a person who
          is not a foreign person, the taxable value of the land is
          to be reduced to the proportionate value of the interest in
          the land of the foreign person,
          (c) if the foreign person is a joint owner of the
          residential land, the person is to be individually (and not
          jointly) assessed and is liable in respect of the value of
          the person's proportionate interest in the land as if the
          person were the owner of a part of the land in proportion
          to the person's interest (and accordingly section 27 (2)-
          (4) of the Principal Act does not apply),
          (d) if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the
          residential land is used for purposes other than
          residential purposes, the taxable value of the land is to
          be reduced by the apportionment factor determined in
          accordance with section 104ZB of the Duties Act 1997 in
          relation to the land,
          (e) if the foreign person is the trustee of a fixed trust
          (within the meaning of section 3A of the Principal Act) in
          relation to the residential land, the person is not liable
          to surcharge land tax,
          (f) the provisions of the Principal Act relating to the
          persons who are taken to be owners of the residential land
          apply to surcharge land tax, except that section 23 of the
          Principal Act does not operate to make a mortgagee in
          possession an owner of the land unless the mortgagor is a
          foreign person,
          (g) the person is exempt from liability to pay surcharge
          land tax in respect of the land for a land tax year because
          the land is the principal place of residence of the foreign
          person (and accordingly sections 9C and 9D of the Principal
          Act operate to reduce the land value of the land if it is
          the principal place of residence of the person) only if the
          person is eligible for the exemption under section 5B,
          (h) the tax thresholds under Division 4A of Part 7 of the
          Principal Act do not apply to surcharge land tax,
          (i) any other modification prescribed by the regulations
          under the Principal Act applies to surcharge land tax.
     (5) If a foreign person defaults in the payment of surcharge land tax
     then, without releasing the foreign person from his or her liability,
     the following provisions apply as long as the default continues--
          (a) if the foreign person is a joint owner of the land
          concerned--any other joint owner (whether or not a foreign
          person) is, on being served with a notice by the Chief
          Commissioner requiring payment of the unpaid surcharge land
          tax, responsible for its payment and the unpaid tax may be
          recovered from that other joint owner as if he or she were
          the defaulting taxpayer,
          (b) if the foreign person is a beneficiary of a trust
          relating to the land concerned--the trustee (whether or not
          a foreign person) is, on being served with a notice by the
          Chief Commissioner requiring payment of the unpaid
          surcharge land tax, responsible for its payment and the
          unpaid tax may be recovered from that trustee as if he or
          she were the defaulting taxpayer,
          (c) all payments made under this subsection by that other
          joint owner or that trustee are taken to be made on behalf
          of the defaulting taxpayer,
          (d) that other joint owner or that trustee may recover from
          the foreign person any amount paid by that other joint
          owner or that trustee under this subsection.
Section 5B Surcharge land tax--residence requirement applying to principal place of residence exemption
Section 5B Surcharge land tax--residence requirement applying to principal place of
residence exemption
     (1) A person is eligible for an exemption from liability to pay
     surcharge land tax in respect of residential land for a land tax year
     because the land is the principal place of residence of the person
     only if--
          (a) the person is a permanent resident at midnight on 31
          December of the previous year, and
          (b) the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that, during the
          land tax year, the person intends to use and occupy the
          land as the principal place of residence of the person in
          accordance with the residence requirement, and
          (c) the person lodges a declaration with a land tax return
          required to be furnished under section 12 of the Principal
          Act for the land tax year to the effect that the person has
          that intention.
     (2) The person must use and occupy the land as the person's principal
     place of residence for a continuous period of 200 days in the land
     tax year. This requirement is referred to as
     "the residence requirement".
     (2A) A person does not use and occupy land as the person's principal
     place of residence during a period of the person's physical absence
     from Australia.
     (2B) The Chief Commissioner may, in exceptional circumstances, waive
     the requirement in subsection (2A) in relation to a person's brief
     physical absence from Australia.
     (3) If the residence requirement is not complied with by the person,
     surcharge land tax liability is to be assessed or reassessed as if
     the person's exemption from liability to pay surcharge land tax for
     the land tax year had never applied.
     (4) The failure of the person to comply with the residence
     requirement is taken to be a tax default for the purposes of Part 5
     of the Taxation Administration Act 1996.
     (5) Any interest that is payable on the tax default in accordance
     with Part 5 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 accrues on the
     amount of surcharge land tax assessable to the person for the period
     commencing on the last day allowed for furnishing the land tax return
     for the land tax year and ending on the day when the assessment or
     reassessment referred to in subsection (3) is made.
Section 5BA Surcharge land tax--residence requirement applying to principal place of residence exemption for retirement visa holders
Section 5BA Surcharge land tax--residence requirement applying to principal place of
residence exemption for retirement visa holders
     (1) Section 5B applies to a retirement visa holder in the same way as
     it applies to a permanent resident, subject to any modifications
     prescribed by the regulations.
     (2) However, in the application of that section to the liability of a
     retirement visa holder to pay surcharge land tax in respect of
     residential land for a land tax year, the residence requirement is
     satisfied if the person used and occupied the land as the person's
     principal place of residence for a continuous period of 200 days in
     the previous land tax year.

          or after the taxing date) for the purpose of its use for
          new home construction and sold by the corporation after the
          taxing date and after the issue of a subdivision
          certificate (as referred to in the Environmental Planning
          and Assessment Act 1979, section 6.4) for the subdivision,
          or
          (c) the land has been used by the corporation or a related
          body corporate, before or after the taxing date, wholly or
          predominantly for commercial or industrial purposes.

     by the person in respect of the land for a land tax year.
     (4) A foreign person is exempt from liability to pay surcharge land
     tax in respect of land for a land tax year if the person is approved

     (5) The approval of a foreign person as an exempt person under this
     section is subject to the following provisions--
          (a) an approval may be given for one or more land tax years
          and can be given for a land tax year before or after the
          end of the land tax year,
          (b) an approval may be given subject to conditions and the
          approval operates subject to any such conditions,
          (c) the conditions of an approval may be varied by the
          Chief Commissioner at any time by notice to the person,
          (d) an approval can be revoked by the Chief Commissioner at
          any time by notice to the person,
          (e) the revocation of an approval can be backdated to
          extend to a tax year in respect of which the exemption
          conferred by the approval has already been applied, in
          which case surcharge land tax is payable and is to be
          assessed or reassessed as if the approval had never applied
          in respect of that tax year.
     (6) Surcharge land tax may be refunded under this section only if an
     application for the refund is made--
          (a) within 12 months after the entitling event, and
          (b) no later than 10 years after completion of the transfer

Section 5D Surcharge land tax--discretionary trusts
     (1) The trustee of a discretionary trust is taken to be a foreign
     person in that capacity for the purposes of section 5A if the trust
     does not prevent a foreign person from being a beneficiary of the
     trust.
     (2) If a discretionary trust prevents a foreign person from being a
     beneficiary of the trust, the trustee is not in that capacity a
     foreign person for the purposes of section 5A.
     (3) A discretionary trust is considered to prevent a foreign person
     from being a beneficiary of the trust if (and only if) both of the
     following requirements are satisfied--
          (a) no potential beneficiary of the trust is a foreign
          person (the
          "no foreign beneficiary requirement"),
          (b) the terms of the trust are not capable of amendment in
          a manner that would result in there being a potential
          beneficiary of the trust who is a foreign person (the
          "no amendment requirement").
               Note : Under the transitional arrangements for
               this section in Schedule 2 to the Principal Act,
               the no amendment requirement does not apply to a
               trust that satisfies the no foreign beneficiary
               requirement immediately before the commencement
               of this section.
     (4) A person is a
     "potential beneficiary" of a discretionary trust if the exercise or
     failure to exercise a discretion under the terms of the trust can
     result in any property of the trust being distributed to or applied
     for the benefit of the person.
          Note : A potential beneficiary is not limited to persons
          named in the trust instrument and extends to the members of
          any class of persons to whom or for whose benefit trust
          property can be distributed or applied pursuant to the
          discretions of the trust.
     (5) For the removal of doubt, a person is not a potential beneficiary
     of a discretionary trust if the terms of the trust prevent any
     property of the trust from being distributed to or applied for the
     benefit of the person.
     (6) In this section,
     "property" includes money, and a reference to the distribution or
     application of property includes a reference to the payment of money.
Section 6 Land tax liability in respect of flood liable land
     (1) In this section--
     "council", in relation to any land, means the council of the area,
     within the meaning of the Local Government Act 1993, in which the
     land is situated.
     "flood liable land" means land which is unoccupied and which has been
     determined, by the council, to be (or which is, in the opinion of the
     Chief Commissioner) unsuitable for the erection of a building because
     it is liable to flooding.
     (2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act or the
     provisions of any other Act, where a person is the owner of 2 or more
     parcels of land, one or more of which is flood liable land, the
     amount of land tax payable by that person shall, in respect only of
     such land as is flood liable land, be--
          (a) calculated separately in respect of each parcel of that
          land that is not exempt from taxation, and
          (b) so calculated in the case of each such parcel as if it
          were the only land owned by that person.
     (3) This section does not apply to surcharge land tax under section
     5A.
