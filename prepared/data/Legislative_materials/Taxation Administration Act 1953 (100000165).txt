Amounts covered by this Division

 (1) This Division sets out how the Commissioner must treat the following kinds of amount:
 (a) a payment the Commissioner receives in respect of a current or anticipated tax debt or tax debts of an entity;
 (b) a credit (including an excess non -RBA credit) that an entity is entitled to under a taxation law;
 (c) an RBA surplus of an entity.
 (2) The Commissioner must treat each such amount using the method set out in section  8AAZLA or 8AAZLB (but not both).
Note: In either case, section 8AAZLC has some additional rules that apply to RBA surpluses and to certain excess non -RBA credits.
 (3) However, the Commissioner does not have to treat an amount using either of those methods if doing so would require the Commissioner to apply the amount against a tax debt:
 (a) that is due but not yet payable; or
 (b) in respect of which the taxpayer has complied with an arrangement under section  255-15 to pay the debt by instalments; or
 (c) in respect of which the Commissioner has agreed to defer recovery under section  255-5.
 (4) Furthermore, the Commissioner does not have to treat an amount using either of those methods if:
 (a) doing so would require the Commissioner to apply the amount against a tax debt; and
 (b) the tax debt is a penalty that is due and payable under section  269-20 in Schedule 1 (penalties for directors of non-complying companies).

TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT 1953

Method 1--allocating the amount first to an RBA

 (1) The Commissioner may, in the manner he or she determines, allocate the amount to an RBA of the entity or, if the entity is a member of an RBA group, to an RBA of another member of the group.
 (2) The Commissioner must then also apply the amount against the following kinds of debts (if there are any):
 (a) tax debts that have been allocated to that RBA;
 (b) general interest charge on such tax debts.
 (3) To the extent that the amount is not applied under subsection  (2), it gives rise to an excess non-RBA credit in favour of the entity that:
 (a) is equal to the part of the amount that is not applied; and
 (b) relates to the RBA to which the amount was allocated.

TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT 1953
- SECT 8AAZLB
Method 2--applying the amount first against a non - RBA tax debt

 (1) The Commissioner may, in the manner he or she determines, apply the amount against a non -RBA tax debt of the entity or, if the entity is a member of an RBA group, against a non-RBA tax debt of another member of the group.
 (2) If the non-RBA tax debt is:
 (a) a tax debt that has been allocated to an RBA; or
 (b) general interest charge on such a tax debt;
the Commissioner must then also allocate the amount to that RBA.
 (3) To the extent that the amount is not applied under subsection  (1), it gives rise to an excess non-RBA credit in favour of the entity that is equal to the part of the amount that is not applied.
 (4) The excess non-RBA credit relates to the RBA (if any) that the Commissioner determines and the balance of that RBA is adjusted in the entity&#39;s favour by the amount of that credit.
Separate RBAs for one entity
 (5) If the non-RBA tax debt mentioned in subsection  (1) has been allocated to 2 or more RBAs, the Commissioner must allocate the amount applied between those RBAs in the proportions in which the tax debt was allocated.

 (a) allocated to an RBA; or
 (b) applied against a non-RBA tax debt;
the related RBA is adjusted in the Commissioner&#39;s favour by the same amount.

Voluntary payments only to be refunded on request

Section 14ZZF
Giving documents to the ART

 (1) Section 23 (decision -maker must give Tribunal reasons and documents--general rule) of the ART Act does not apply in relation to an application for review of a reviewable objection decision.

 (b) the notice of the taxation decision concerned;
 (c) the taxation objection concerned;
 (d) the notice of the objection decision;
 (e) every other document that is:
 (i) in the Commissioner&#39;s possession or under the Commissioner&#39;s control; and

 (f) a list of the documents (if any) being given under paragraph  (e).
 (3) Section 25 (decision -maker must give Tribunal additional documents within 28 days--general rule) of the ART Act does not apply in relation to the ART&#39;s review of a reviewable objection decision.
 (4) Instead, if:
 (a) at any time during the ART&#39;s review of a reviewable objection decision a document that is necessary to the review comes into the possession or under the control of the decision -maker; and
 (b) the document has not been given to the ART for the purposes of the review;
the decision-maker must give a copy of the document to the ART within 28 days after the day on which the document came into the possession or under the control of the decision -maker.
 (5) In addition to subsection  (4), if, at any time during the ART&#39;s review of a reviewable objection decision, the ART is satisfied that documents that may be relevant to the review are in the possession or under the control of the decision -maker of the reviewable objection decision, the Tribunal may require the decision-maker to give a list of those documents to the Tribunal within a specified period.
 (6) To avoid doubt, the ART&#39;s power in subsection  (5) of this section is in addition to the ART&#39;s power in section 26 (decision-maker must give Tribunal additional documents on request--general rule) of the ART Act.
 (7) For the purposes of the ART Act:

TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT 1953
Section 14ZZH
Limitation on orders staying or affecting reviewable objection decisions relating to small business taxation assessment decisions

 (1) This section applies if:
 (a) a party to a proceeding for review of a reviewable objection decision that relates to a small business taxation assessment decision applies for:
 (i) an order staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the decision; or
 (ii) an order varying or revoking such an order; and
 (b) the party requesting the order is not the Commissioner of Taxation.
 (2) Despite the ART Act, the ART must not make the order unless the party satisfies the ART that, when considered in the context of both the particular circumstances of the decision under review and the overall taxation system, the application for review and the request for making the order are not frivolous, vexatious, misconceived, lacking in substance or otherwise intended to unduly impede, prejudice or restrict the proper administration or operation of a taxation law.
Note 1: The kind of orders that the ART may make include the following:
        (a) an order directing the Commissioner not to sue in a court to recover a specified amount relating to the reviewable objection decision (see subsection  255-5(2) of Schedule 1 to this Act);
        (b) an order directing the Commissioner to offer or accept payment of a liability relating to the reviewable objection decision by instalments under a specified arrangement (see section  255-15 of Schedule 1 to this Act);
        (c) an order directing the Commissioner not to issue one or more written notices to specified third parties who owe or may later owe money to the applicant as a means of recovering a liability relating to the reviewable objection decision (see section  260-5 of Schedule 1 to this Act).
Note 2: However, an order that would materially and permanently alter the decision under review would not be an order staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of such a decision for the purpose of securing the effectiveness of the hearing and determination of the application for review. For example:
        (a) an order directing the Commissioner to defer the time at which a tax liability becomes due and payable; or
        (b) an order directing the Commissioner to remit the imposition of interest charges on unpaid liabilities that are due and payable.

To help taxpayers meet their annual income tax liability, they are required to pay amounts of their income at regular intervals as it is earned during the year. The system for collecting these amounts is called &quot;Pay as you go&quot;.Amounts collected under this system also go towards meeting liability for Medicare levy and liability to repay debts under certain income -contingent loan schemes.
Section 12-55 (about voluntary agreements) covers a payment only if no other provision requires the payer to withhold an amount from the payment.
12-7  Division does not apply to alienated personal services payments

 Rules for all rulings
357-50  Scope of Division
  This Division applies to *public rulings, *private rulings and *oral rulings.
Note: Section 362-70 modifies how this Subdivision applies to rulings by Industry Innovation and Science Australia.
357-55  The provisions that are relevant for rulings
  Provisions of Acts and regulations of which the Commissioner has the general administration are relevant for rulings if the provisions are about any of the following:
 (a) *tax;
 (b) *Medicare levy;
 (c) fringe benefits tax;
 (d) *franking tax;
 (e) *withholding tax;
 (f) *mining withholding tax;
 (fa) *petroleum resource rent tax;
 (fb) *indirect tax;
 (fc) *excise duty;
 (fd) levy under the Major Bank Levy Act 2017;
 (fe) *Laminaria and Corallina decommissioning levy;
 (ff) *build to rent development misuse tax;
 (fg) *Australian IIR/UTPR tax;
 (fh) *Australian DMT tax;
 (g) the administration or collection of those taxes, levies and duties;
 (h) a grant or benefit mentioned in section  8 of the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000, or the administration or payment of such a grant or benefit;
 (i) a *net fuel amount, or the administration of a net fuel amount;
 (ia) an *assessed net fuel amount, or the collection or payment of an assessed net fuel amount;
 (j) a *net amount, or the administration of a net amount;
 (ja) an *assessed net amount, or the collection or payment of an assessed net amount;
 (k) a *wine tax credit, or the administration or payment of a wine tax credit.
357-60  When rulings are binding on the Commissioner
 (1) Subject to subsection  (5), a ruling binds the Commissioner in relation to you (whether or not you are aware of the ruling) if:
 (a) the ruling applies to you; and
 (b) you rely on the ruling by acting (or omitting to act) in accordance with the ruling.
Example 1: A public ruling is expressed to apply to a class of entities in relation to a particular scheme. Tim is a member of that class of entities and he is one of a number of taxpayers who enter into that scheme. The ruling applies to Tim.
 Tim relies on the ruling by lodging an income tax return that is in accordance with the ruling.
 Under the ruling, Tim&#39;s deductions in relation to the scheme are worked out to be a particular amount. Because Tim has relied on the ruling, the Commissioner must use that amount in making Tim&#39;s assessment (unless Tim stops relying on the ruling or the law is more favourable to him: see sections  357-65 and 357 -70).
Example 2: Cecelia applies for, and obtains, a private ruling that, when she makes a payment in specified circumstances, she would not have to withhold an amount under a relevant provision. Cecelia makes the payment in the circumstances specified in the ruling, so the ruling applies to her.
 Cecelia relies on the ruling by not withholding an amount from the payment. The Commissioner must not apply the provision in relation to Cecelia in a way that is inconsistent with the ruling (unless Cecelia stops relying on the ruling or the law is more favourable to her: see sections  357-65 and 357-70).
Example 3: Cathie obtains a private ruling that a type of supply she makes is GST-free. She relies on the ruling by:
        (a) giving her customers invoices that show no GST payable on the supplies; and
        (b) lodging her GST return on the basis that the supplies are GST -free.
 The Commissioner must administer the GST law in relation to Cathie on the basis that the supplies to which the ruling relates are GST -free. This does not apply if Cathie stops relying on the ruling, such as by issuing tax invoices that show GST payable on the supplies: see paragraph (1)(b).
Note 1: A ruling about the amount of tax payable that binds the Commissioner provides protection in relation to that amount. There is no shortfall interest charge or tax shortfall penalty payable in respect of that amount as there can be no shortfall in tax payable.
Note 2: A ruling about the operation of a provision would stop applying to you if the provision is repealed, or is amended to have a different effect. However, if the provision is re -enacted and expresses the same ideas as the old provision, the ruling would still apply: see section 357-85.
 (2) You may rely on the ruling at any time unless prevented from doing so by a time limit imposed by a *taxation law. It is not necessary to do so at the first opportunity.
GST rulings
 (3) The *GST payable on a *supply or importation is the amount worked out in accordance with a ruling (if any) that:
 (a) relates to the GST payable on the supply or importation; and
 (b) binds the Commissioner in relation to the supplier or importer.
Note: The ruling will stop affecting the GST payable if the supplier or importer stops relying on the ruling: see paragraph  (1)(b).
 (4) Subsection (3) does not apply for the purposes of an objection to the ruling under section  359-60.
Indirect tax rulings
 (5) An *indirect tax or excise ruling (except to the extent that the ruling relates to an *excise law) binds the Commissioner in relation to:
 (a) an entity (the representative entity) that is:
 (i) the *representative member of a *GST group; or
 (ii) the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture; or
 (iii) the *representative of an *incapacitated entity; and
 (b) an entity (the member entity) that is:
 (i) a *member of the GST group; or
 (ii) a *participant in the GST joint venture; or
 (iii) the incapacitated entity;
if, and only if, both the representative entity and the member entity rely on the ruling by acting (or omitting to act) in accordance with the ruling.
 (6) Subsection (5) applies if:
 (a) the ruling applies to the member entity; and
 (b) the ruling relates to what would be:
 (i) a liability of the member entity to *indirect tax; or
 (ii) an entitlement of the member entity to a credit (other than a *fuel tax credit) under an *indirect tax law; or
 (iii) an *increasing adjustment, a *decreasing adjustment, or a luxury car tax adjustment (within the meaning of the *Luxury Car Tax Act), that the member entity has;
  if the rules in the indirect tax law relating to *GST groups, *GST joint ventures or *incapacitated entities did not apply; and
 (c) because of those rules:
 (i) if that indirect tax were payable, it would be payable by the representative entity; or
 (ii) if there was an entitlement to that credit, it would be an entitlement of the representative entity; or
 (iii) if any entity had that adjustment, it would be an adjustment that the representative entity had.
357-65  Stopping relying on a ruling
 (1) You can stop relying on a ruling. You do this by acting (or omitting to act) in a way that is not in accordance with the ruling.
Note: There is no penalty for a shortfall resulting from failing to follow a ruling. However, there are penalties for shortfalls resulting from failing to take reasonable care, and from taking a position about a large income tax item that is not reasonably arguable: see Division  284.
 (2) You may stop relying on a ruling at any time unless prevented from doing so by a time limit imposed by a *taxation law.
 (3) Having stopped relying on a ruling, you may rely on the ruling again unless prevented from doing so by a time limit imposed by a *taxation law.
357-70  Commissioner may apply the law if more favourable than the ruling
 (1) The Commissioner may apply a relevant provision to you in the way it would apply if you had not relied on a ruling if:
 (a) doing so would produce a more favourable result for you; and
 (b) the Commissioner is not prevented from doing so by a time limit imposed by a *taxation law.
 (2) The Commissioner does not have a duty to consider whether to apply subsection  (1) to you, whether he or she is requested to do so by you or by any other entity.
357-75  Inconsistent rulings
 (1) The rules in this table have effect if:
 (a) a ruling and a later ruling both apply to you; and
 (b) the 2 rulings are inconsistent.
However, the rules in the table only apply to the extent of the inconsistency, and do not apply to *indirect tax or excise rulings.
 
Inconsistent rulings (other than indirect tax or excise rulings)ItemIf the earlier ruling is:And the later inconsistent ruling is:The result is:1A *public rulingAny rulingYou may rely on either ruling.2A *private ruling or an *oral rulingA private ruling or an oral rulingIf you informed the Commissioner about the existence of the earlier ruling when you applied for the later ruling, the earlier ruling is taken not to have been made.Otherwise, the later ruling is taken not to have been made.3A *private ruling or an *oral rulingA *public rulingThe earlier ruling is taken not to have been made if, when the later ruling is made:(a) the income year or other period to which the rulings relate has not begun; and(b) the *scheme to which the rulings relate has not begun to be carried out.Otherwise, you may rely on either ruling.
 (1A) If:
 (a) 2 inconsistent *indirect tax or excise rulings apply to you; and
 (b) the rulings are both *public rulings;
then, to the extent of the inconsistency, you may rely on either of the rulings.
 (1B) If:
 (a) 2 inconsistent *indirect tax or excise rulings apply to you; and
 (b) at least one of the rulings is not a *public ruling;
then, to the extent of the inconsistency:
 (c) the later ruling is taken to apply from the later of:
 (i) the time it is made; and
 (ii) the time (if any) specified in the ruling as being the time from which it begins to apply; and
 (d) the earlier ruling is taken to cease to apply at that later time.
 (2) If 3 or more rulings apply to you and the rulings are inconsistent, apply the rules in this section to each combination of 2 rulings in the order in which they were made.
357-80  Contracts for schemes
  For the purposes of this Part, if a contract requiring a *scheme has been entered into, the scheme is taken to have begun to be carried out.
357-85  Effect on ruling if relevant provision re -enacted
  If:
 (a) the Commissioner makes a ruling about a relevant provision (the old provision); and
 (b) that provision is re -enacted or remade (with or without modifications, and whether or not the old provision is repealed);
the ruling is taken also to be a ruling about that provision as re-enacted or remade (the new provision), but only so far as the new provision expresses the same ideas as the old provision.
Note 1: Section 357-55 specifies the relevant provisions.
Note 2: Ideas in taxation provisions are not necessarily different just because different forms of words are used: see section  15AC of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and section 1-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
357-90  Validity of ruling not affected by formal defect
  The validity of a ruling is not affected merely because a provision of this Part relating to the form of the ruling or the procedure for making it has not been complied with.

 (1) If the Commissioner considers that the correctness of a *private ruling or an *oral ruling would depend on which assumptions were made about a future event or other matter, the Commissioner may:
 (a) decline to make the ruling; or
 (b) make such of the assumptions as the Commissioner considers to be most appropriate.
 (2) Before making the ruling, the Commissioner must:
 (a) tell the applicant which assumptions (if any) the Commissioner proposes to make; and
 (b) give the applicant a reasonable opportunity to respond.
Note: The Commissioner should make a private ruling within 60 days. However, if the Commissioner tells the applicant about assumptions the Commissioner proposes to make under this section, that period is extended: see subsection  359-50(2).
357-115  Additional information provided by applicant
  In considering an application for a *private ruling or an *oral ruling, the Commissioner may take into account additional information provided by the applicant after the application was made (whether in response to a request under section  357-105 or otherwise).

 (3) You, your *agent or your *legal personal representative may withdraw the application at any time before the ruling is made. The Commissioner must confirm the withdrawal in writing.
359-15  Private rulings to be given to applicants
  The Commissioner makes a *private ruling by recording the ruling in writing and giving a copy of it to the applicant. The copy may be given electronically.
359-20  Private rulings must contain certain details
 (1) A *private ruling must state that it is a private ruling.
 (2) A *private ruling must identify the entity to whom it applies and specify the relevant *scheme and the relevant provision to which it relates.

 (1) A *private ruling may specify the time from which it begins to apply and the time at which it ceases to apply.
 (2) The specified start time, or end time, may be before, when, or after the *private ruling is made and may be determined by reference to a specified event.
 (3) A *private ruling that does not specify a start time applies from the time when it is made.
 (4) A *private ruling, other than an *indirect tax or excise ruling, that does not specify an end time ceases to apply at the end of the income year or other accounting period in which it started to apply.
Note: A private ruling that:
        (a) is an indirect tax or excise ruling; and
        (b) does not specify an end time;
 continues to apply until it is overridden by a later indirect tax or excise ruling: see subsection  357-75(1B).
359-30  Ruling for trustee of a trust
  A *private ruling given to or for the trustee of a trust and relating to the affairs of the trust also applies to:
 (a) if the ruling is not an *indirect tax or excise ruling--the beneficiaries of the trust; and
 (b) in any case--another trustee who is appointed to replace a trustee.
359-35  Dealing with applications
 (1) The Commissioner must comply with an application for a *private ruling and make the ruling. However, this obligation is subject to subsections (2) and (3).
 (2) The Commissioner may decline to make a *private ruling if:
 (a) the Commissioner considers that making the ruling would prejudice or unduly restrict the administration of a *taxation law; or
 (b) the matter sought to be ruled on is already being, or has been, considered by the Commissioner for you; or
 (c) both:

359-45  Related rulings
  If the Commissioner is making a *private ruling (the first ruling) you sought on the way in which, in the Commissioner&#39;s opinion, a relevant provision applies or would apply to you, the Commissioner may:
 (a) make the first ruling a ruling on the way in which another relevant provision applies or would apply to you; or
 (b) make an additional private ruling on the way in which:
 (i) another relevant provision applies or would apply; or
 (ii) a relevant provision applies or would apply to you in relation to a *scheme related to the scheme to which the first ruling applies.
Note: Section 357-55 specifies the relevant provisions.
359-50  Delays in making private rulings

 (b) has not otherwise declined to make the ruling by the end of that period.
 (4) The applicant must lodge with the objection a draft *private ruling.
359-55  Revised private rulings
 (1) The Commissioner may make a revised *private ruling that applies to you if:
 (a) the Commissioner had previously made a private ruling that applies to you; and
 (b) if the ruling is not an *indirect tax or excise ruling--when the Commissioner makes the revised private ruling:
 (i) the *scheme to which the earlier ruling relates has not begun to be carried out; and
 (ii) if the earlier ruling relates to an income year or other accounting period--that year or period has not begun.
Note: Your private ruling may be affected by a later inconsistent ruling: see section  357-75.
 (2) The Commissioner must give you a copy of the revised *private ruling. The copy may be given electronically.
 (3) The Commissioner may make the revised *private ruling whether or not there is an application for the revised ruling.
 (4) When the revised *private ruling is made, the ruling in its initial form stops applying to you.
 (5) However, if:
 (a) the *private ruling is an *indirect tax or excise ruling; and
 (b) the revised private ruling specifies the time from which the revision begins to apply (being a time after the time the revision is made);
the ruling in its initial form stops applying to you at the time so specified.
359-60  Objections, reviews and appeals relating to private rulings
 (1) You may object against a *private ruling that applies to you in the manner set out in Part IVC if you are dissatisfied with it.

 (b) the ruling relates to *withholding tax or *mining withholding tax that has become due and payable; or
 (c) all of the following subparagraphs apply:

 (ii) the Commissioner has made a decision about the excise duty, or other amount, payable in relation to those goods;
 (iii) the decision is reviewable under an excise law.
359-65  Commissioner may consider new information on objection
 (1) In deciding whether to allow (wholly or in part), or to disallow, an objection under Part  IVC against a *private ruling, the Commissioner may consider any additional information that the Commissioner did not consider when making the ruling.
 (2) For information you do not have, the Commissioner must tell you what the information is and give you a reasonable opportunity to respond before allowing or disallowing the objection.
 (3) However, if the Commissioner considers that the additional information is such that the *scheme to which the application related is materially different from the scheme to which the ruling relates:
 (a) the Commissioner must request the applicant to make an application for another *private ruling; and
 (b) the objection is taken not to have been made.
359-70  Successful objection decision alters ruling
  A *private ruling has effect as altered by an objection decision (within the meaning of Part IVC) made by the Commissioner if:
 (a) the Commissioner made the decision allowing, wholly or in part, a taxation objection (within the meaning of that Part) against the ruling; and
 (b) the period in which an appeal against, or an application for the review of, the decision may be made has ended without such an appeal or application being made.

Subdivision 396-C--Common Reporting Standard
 Guide to Subdivision 396-C
396-100  What this Subdivision is about
Australian Financial Institutions must give the Commissioner certain information about accounts of foreign residents. This obligation is based on the Common Reporting Standard.Note 1: This obligation will assist the Australian Government to exchange information with other jurisdictions in accordance with international agreements, such as the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, done at Strasbourg on 25  January 1988. In 2015, the text of the Convention was available on the OECD&#39;s website (http://www.oecd.org).Note 2: The purpose of the Common Reporting Standard is to reduce international tax evasion. It sets out due diligence procedures for financial institutions to apply to identify account holders that are foreign tax residents, and provides for financial institutions to report information with respect to such account holders.This Subdivision also creates record-keeping obligations in relation to the requirement to give the Commissioner information.This Subdivision also requires the Commissioner to report on certain Reportable Accounts that are maintained by Australian Reporting Financial Institutions.
