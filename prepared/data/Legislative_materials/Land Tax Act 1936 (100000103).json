      "text": "(1) Subject to subsection (1a), land tax for land with a taxable value falling within a threshold set by this section is calculated in accordance with the table in Schedule 1 Part 2 clause 2 for the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 financial years and in accordance with the table in Schedule 1 Part 2 clause 3 for the 2022/2023 financial year and for each subsequent financial year. (1a) If land with a taxable value exceeding $25 000 is owned by a person as trustee of a trust, land tax for the land is calculated in accordance with the table in Schedule 1 Part 3 clause 4 for the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 financial years and in accordance with the table in Schedule 1 Part 3 clause 5 for the 2022/2023 financial year and for each subsequent financial year. (1b) Subsection (1a) does not apply to-- (a) land subject to a fixed trust if a written notice of the beneficial interests in the land is in force under section 12; or (b) land subject to a unit trust scheme if a written notice of the unitholdings in the scheme is in force under section 13; or (c) land subject to a discretionary trust if-- (i) the land is pre-existing trust land (within the meaning of section 13A); and (ii) a written notice of a designated beneficiary of the trust is in force under section 13A; or (d) land subject to an excluded trust; or (e) land subject to a public unit trust scheme. Note-- Other provisions of this Part provide for assessment of land tax in the above cases in accordance with subsection (1) at the rates set out in Schedule 1 Part 2. (1c) Subsection (1a) does not apply to land that is owned by a corporation if the corporation is grouped with 1 or more related corporations under Division 6 and land tax is assessed in accordance with Section 13J. (2) For the 2020/2021 financial year, the thresholds will be as follows: Threshold Amount Threshold A $450 000 Threshold B $550 000 (the \"unadjusted 2010/2011 amount\") adjusted in accordance with subsection (2a) Threshold C $800 000 (the \"unadjusted 2010/2011 amount\") adjusted in accordance with subsection (2a) Threshold D $1 350 000 (2a) An amount described as an \"unadjusted 2010/2011 amount\" in the table in subsection (2) is to be adjusted according to the following formula (to take into account increases in the site value of land occurring since the thresholds were last set in relation to the 2010/2011 financial year): where-- \"Threshold\"\"2020\" represents the adjusted threshold for the 2020/2021 financial year \"Threshold\"\"1\" represents the unadjusted 2010/2011 amount \"Index value2020 = Index value2019 x (1 + average percentage change in site values for the 2020/2021 financial year) where \"Index value2019 is the Index value for the 2019/2020 financial year determined in accordance with this section as in force immediately before the commencement of this subsection, \"Index value\"\"2020\" is the Index value for the 2020/2021 financial year and the average percentage change in site values for that financial year is determined under subsection (4). (3) Subject to this section, for each financial year after the 2020/2021 financial year (\"year x\"), thresholds A, B and C will be adjusted to take into account increases in the site value of land according to the following formula: where-- \"Threshold\"\"year x\" represents each of the thresholds for the relevant financial year (\"year x\") \"Threshold\"\"1\" represents each of the relevant thresholds set out in subsection (2) for the 2020/2021 financial year \"Index value\"\"year x = Index valueyear x-1 x (1 + Avg percentage change in site valuesyear x) where \"Index value\"\"year x\" is the Index value for the relevant financial year (\"year x\") and the average percentage change in site values for that financial year is determined under subsection (4), and with the Index value for the 2020/2021 financial year being 1. (3a) Subject to this section, for each financial year after the 2020/2021 financial year, threshold D will be adjusted in accordance with the following table: Financial year Threshold D amount 2021/2022 $1 350 000 2022/2023 $2 000 000 2023/2024 and each subsequent financial year $2 000 000 adjusted in accordance with subsection (3b) (3b) Subject to this section, for the 2023/2024 financial year and each subsequent financial year (\"year x\"), threshold D will be adjusted to take into account increases in the site value of land according to the following formula: where-- \"Threshold D\"\"year x\" represents threshold D for the relevant financial year (\"year x\") \"Index value\"\"year x = Index valueyear x-1 x (1 + Avg percentage change in site valuesyear x) where \"Index"

(4) For the purposes of subsections (2a), (3) and (3b), the average percentage change in site values for a particular financial year will be determined by the Valuer-General after the application of the following principles: (a) in determining the average percentage change in site values for the financial year, the Valuer-General will take into account changes in the site value of land according to valuations applying under the Valuation of Land Act 1971 with respect to a period of 12 months expiring on a date to be determined by the Valuer-General, being a date that falls on or before Section 30 June in the financial year immediately preceding the relevant financial year; (b) the average percentage change in site values must take into account changes in the site value of residential land and changes in the site value of other land (as identified by the Valuer-General), with the averaging being undertaken in accordance with a method determined to be appropriate by the Valuer-General after taking into account the provisions of this Act and the Valuation of Land Act 1971; (c) for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b)-- (i) vacant land zoned for residential purposes will be treated as residential land and vacant land zoned for any other purpose (other than primary production) will be treated as other land; and (ii) land used for primary production must be excluded. (4a) If, after applying subsection (4) to determine the Index value for the 2020/2021 financial year under subsection (2a), the result would be an Index value for that year that would be less than or equal to the Index value that applied for the 2019/2020 financial year or a preceding financial year, the adjusted thresholds for the 2020/2021 financial year will be taken to be the thresholds that applied for the 2019/2020 financial year. (5) If, after applying subsection (4) to determine the Index value for a particular financial year (\"year x\") under subsection (3) or (3b), the result would be an Index value for year x that would be less than or equal to an Index value that has applied for-- (a) if the Index value is determined under subsection (3)--the 2020/2021 financial year or a subsequent financial year occurring before year x; or (b) if the Index value is determined under subsection (3b)--the 2022/2023 financial year or a subsequent financial year occurring before year x, the thresholds for year x will remain unchanged (so as to be equal to the year x-1 amounts). (6) On or before Section 30 June in each year (commencing in 2011), the Valuer-General must publish by notice in the Gazette-- (a) the average percentage change in site values for the ensuing financial year (\"year x\"); and (b) the Index value for the ensuing financial year (\"year x). (7) The Commissioner must, on or after the publication of a notice under subsection (6) with respect to a financial year (the ensuing financial year under subsection (6)), by notice in the Gazette, publish the thresholds that will apply with respect to that financial year (being a notice that may be published before, on or after 1 July in that financial year). (8) For the purposes of subsection (7), the thresholds will be rounded to the nearest $1 000 (with an amount of $500 rounded up). (9) A notice under subsection (7) will have effect according to its terms (and be conclusive in all respects for the purposes of this section)."

(2) For the avoidance of doubt, a trust may only have 1 person who is the designated beneficiary for the purposes of this section (and may only substitute the designated beneficiary by notice lodged under subsection (5)). (3) A notice takes effect, at the option of the trustee (which must be specified in the notice), for the tax year in which the notice is lodged or for the previous or following year, and remains in force until it is withdrawn by the trustee or until the designated beneficiary notifies the Commissioner, in writing, that they no longer consent to being the designated beneficiary (in which case the notice is deemed to have been withdrawn by the trustee). (4) A designated beneficiary may be substituted-- (a) if the designated beneficiary dies or becomes incapacitated; or (b) if the Commissioner is satisfied that, because of a marriage, de facto relationship or domestic relationship that has broken down irretrievably, the designated beneficiary will no longer be a beneficiary of the trust; or (c) in circumstances prescribed by the regulations. (5) If the designated beneficiary may be substituted in accordance with subsection (4), a trustee of the trust may lodge with the Commissioner a written notice-- (a) advising the Commissioner of the grounds on which the designated beneficiary may be substituted; and (b) specifying the name of another beneficiary of the trust who is to be taken to be the designated beneficiary for the purposes of this section in place of the beneficiary named in the original notice. (6) If a written notice is lodged under subsection (5)-- (a) subject to subsection (13), the beneficiary of the trust specified in the notice becomes the designated beneficiary of the trust; and (b) the notice under subsection (1) is taken to have been varied accordingly. (7) A notice under this section must be in the form, and contain the information, determined by the Commissioner. (8) Despite subsection (1), if a trustee withdraws a notice that is in force under this section in respect of a discretionary trust, the trustee cannot lodge another notice under this section in respect of that discretionary trust. (9) If a notice is in force under this section for a discretionary trust, the following provisions apply: (a) the designated beneficiary of the trust is deemed, for the purposes of this Act (other than a residential land exemption), to be the owner (but not to the exclusion of the trustee) of land that was subject to the trust at the prescribed time (\"pre-existing trust land\") and is liable for land tax on that land accordingly, together with any other land owned by the beneficiary, assessed in accordance with section 8A(1) at the rates set out in Schedule 1 Part 2; (b) however, if any pre-existing trust land-- (i) constitutes the principal place of residence of the designated beneficiary; and (ii) would, if it were owned by a natural person, be wholly or partially exempted from land tax under a residential land exemption, the designated beneficiary is deemed to be the owner of the land for the purposes of the residential land exemptions; (c) the trustee for the trust is to be assessed for land tax on the whole of the land subject to the trust as if the land were the only land owned by the trustee-- (i) in the case of pre-existing trust land--in accordance with section 8A(1) at the rates set out in Schedule 1 Part 2; or (ii) in the case of land that became subject to the trust after the prescribed time (\"subsequent trust land\")--in accordance with section 8A(1a) at the rates set out in Schedule 1 Part 3; or (iii) in the case where land subject to the trust consists of both pre-existing trust land and subsequent trust land--in accordance with the following formula: Where-- \"L\" is the land tax assessed for the trustee \"R\"\"1\" is the applicable rate of land tax set out in Schedule 1 Part 2 \"R\"\"2\" is the applicable rate of land tax set out in Schedule 1 Part 3 \"T\" is the total taxable value of all taxable land subject to the trust \"A\" is the total taxable value of the pre-existing trust land subject to the trust \"B\" is the total taxable value"

(13) Subject to subsection (14), a beneficiary of a trust may be the designated beneficiary of the trust for the purposes of this section only if the beneficiary-- (a) is a natural person; and (b) was a beneficiary of the trust at the prescribed time; and (c) is over 18 years of age; and (d) has verified by statutory declaration that the beneficiary consents to being the designated beneficiary of the trust. (14) Where no beneficiaries of a trust are over 18 years of age, a notice under this section may specify that the trustee is to be taken to be the designated beneficiary (as if the trustee were a beneficiary of the trust) but only if the trustee is a natural person.
