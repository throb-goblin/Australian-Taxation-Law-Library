references to the HomeBuilder scheme) subject to the following:
             (a)         Part 2 Divisions 1, 2 and 3 do not apply to a HomeBuilder grant and

in respect of a transaction if the Commissioner is satisfied that the
transaction--

affecting, eligibility or entitlement to the grant; or
             (b)         replaces a previous transaction, entered into before

Australia will be taken not to be an interested person for the purposes of
Section 15).
         (2)         A person

Commissioner--
                   (i)         that he or she has not entered into a contract with a person to sell

                   (ii)         that he or she
has no intention to enter into a contract for the sale of the new home before

sell the new home with a person who is entitled to make an application under
subsection (1)(a) (the "purchaser") and, under the terms of the
contract, he or she is entitled to apply for the housing construction grant
rather than the purchaser.
         (3)         If--
             (a)         a housing construction grant is paid in the case of an application

the sale of the new home to another person (the "purchaser");

subsection (1),
then--
             (d)         a housing
construction grant may be paid to the purchaser if the Commissioner is
satisfied--
                   (i)         that the contract between the first grant recipient and the purchaser
constitutes a genuine sale of the new home; and
                   (ii)         that no agreement exists between the first grant recipient and the
purchaser that the first grant recipient is entitled to apply for the housing
construction grant rather than the purchaser; and
             (e)         the
Commissioner may, by written notice, require the first grant recipient to repay
the amount of the housing construction grant that has been paid to him or
her.
         (4)         If, in a case
where subsection (2)(a) has applied, and the Commissioner issues a notice
under subsection (3)(e), the first grant recipient must also pay to the
Commissioner, at the time of repayment of the amount of the housing construction
grant paid to the first grant recipient, an additional amount equal to the
amount of the grant unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the first grant
recipient genuinely changed his or her intention about not entering into a
contract of a kind referred to in subsection (2)(a)(ii) due to
extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances occurring after the housing
construction grant was paid to the first grant recipient.
         (5)         An amount payable under subsection (3)(e) or (4) (or both)
must be paid to the Commissioner within a period (of at least 14 days)

despite section 7(5) (and whether or not an amount is recovered under
subsection (3)(e)); and
             (b)         to avoid doubt, the Commissioner may, in deciding whether a contract
constitutes a genuine sale of the new home, take into account the matters
referred to in section 18BAB(5), (6) and (7).

         (3)         If a deceased
applicant for a first home owner grant had not, by the date of death, complied

reverse an earlier decision on an application) the Commissioner must give the
applicant notice of the decision.
         (2)         If the decision is to authorise the payment of a first home owner

(whichever is the later).
         (4)         If the Treasurer is satisfied that an objector has a reasonable excuse
for failing to lodge an objection within the 60-day period, the Treasurer may

grant has been paid under this Act or a corresponding law was eligible for the
grant; or
             (d)         whether a condition on which a first home owner grant has been paid

knowing that the answer is false or misleading.
Maximum penalty: $5 000.
Section 37 Self incrimination
         (1)         If a person is required to answer a question or to produce a document
in the course of an authorised investigation, it is not an excuse for
non-compliance that the answer to the question or the contents of the document
might tend to incriminate the person or to make the person liable to a
penalty.
         (2)         However, if the person answers the question or produces the document
after objecting to the requirement to do so on grounds of self-incrimination,
evidence of the answer to the question or the production or contents of the

of a penalty other than proceedings under this Act.

make a false or misleading statement in or in connection with an application for
a first home owner grant.
Maximum penalty: $5 000.

         (1)         The Commissioner may, by written notice, require an applicant (or
former applicant) for a first home owner grant to repay an amount paid on the
application if--
             (a)         the amount was paid in error; or
             (b)         the Commissioner reverses the decision under which the amount was paid
for any other reason.
         (2)         If, as a result of
the making of a false or misleading statement by an applicant, an amount is paid
by way of a first home owner grant, the Commissioner may, by the notice in which
repayment is required or a separate notice, impose a penalty not exceeding the
amount the applicant is required to repay.
         (3)         If an applicant (or
former applicant) for a first home owner grant fails to make a repayment
required under this section or the conditions of the grant, the Commissioner
may, by written notice, impose a penalty not exceeding the amount the applicant
is required to repay.
         (4)         If an amount is paid in error on an application for a first home owner
grant to a third party, the Commissioner may, by written notice, require the

Section 40 Power to recover amount paid in error etc
         (1)         This section applies to the following amounts:

owner grant is required to repay under the conditions of the grant or by
requirement of the Commissioner under this Act;
             (b)         the amount of a penalty imposed on an applicant (or former applicant)
for a first home owner grant;
             (c)         an amount a third party is required to repay by requirement of the
Commissioner under this Act;
             (d)         an amount that a person is required to pay under
section 12A(3)(e) or (4).
         (2)         The liability arising from a requirement to pay (or repay) an amount
to which this section applies is, if the requirement attaches to 2 or more
persons, joint and several.
         (3)         If an applicant who is liable to pay an amount to which this section
applies has, in relation to a home for which the first home owner grant was
sought, an interest in the land on which the home was built or was to be built,
the liability is a first charge on the applicant's interest in that
land.
         (4)         The Commissioner may recover an amount to which this section applies
as a debt due to the Crown.
         (5)         The Commissioner may enter into an arrangement (which may include
provision for the payment of interest) for payment of a liability outstanding
under this section by instalments.
         (6)         The Commissioner may, on application by an applicant (or former
applicant) for a first home owner grant, or on his or her own initiative, write
off the whole or part of a liability to pay an amount to which this section
applies if satisfied that action, or further action, to recover the amount
outstanding is impracticable or unwarranted (but the Commissioner is under no
obligation to consider whether to act under this subsection unless or until such
an application is made or it otherwise appears necessary for him or her to do
so).
Section 40A Extensions of time
         (1)         If the Commissioner is authorised to extend a time limit, or to
shorten a minimum period, under this Act, the Commissioner may, if to do so is
consistent with the provisions of this Act, extend the time limit or shorten the
period even if it has already expired.
         (2)         This section applies to any time limit, whether it expired before or
after the commencement of this section.

penalty.
         (3)         A copy of a notice issued by the Commissioner requiring the payment or
repayment of a specified amount is admissible in legal proceedings as
evidence--
             (a)         that the requirement was made; and

omission in the performance, or purported performance, of functions under this
Act.
