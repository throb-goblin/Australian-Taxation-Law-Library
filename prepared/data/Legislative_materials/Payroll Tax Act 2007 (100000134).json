Note : Section 66A provides an exemption for wages paid or payable for services performed wholly in one or more other countries for a continuous period of more than 6 months. (2) The question of whether wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during the month in which the wages are paid or payable, subject to this section. (3) Any wages paid or payable by an employer in respect of an employee in a particular month are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during that month. Note : For example, if wages paid in a month are paid to an employee for services performed over several months, the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid. The services performed in previous months are disregarded. (The services performed in previous months will be relevant to the question of whether wages paid in those previous months are taxable in this jurisdiction.) (4) If no services are performed by an employee in respect of an employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable to or in relation to the employee-- (a) the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during the most recent prior month in which the employee performed services in respect of the employer, and (b) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during that most recent prior month. (5) If no services were performed by an employee in respect of an employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable to or in relation to the employee or in any prior month-- (a) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable, and (b) the services are taken to have been performed at a place or places where it may be reasonably expected that the services of the employee in respect of the employer will be performed. (6) All amounts of wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer in respect of the same employee are to be aggregated for the purposes of determining whether they are taxable in this jurisdiction (as if they were paid or payable for all services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable, or the most recent prior month, as the case requires).

(1A) To avoid doubt, a variation, agreed on or after 1 July 2024, of a Jobs Plus agreement entered into before that date must not be regarded as the entry into a new Jobs Plus agreement, unless the variation results in an increase in the number of positions that are entitled to a wages exemption under this section. (2) Without limiting the matters that may be specified by a Jobs Plus agreement, the agreement must specify-- (a) the kinds of wages that are exempt wages under this section, and (b) the grounds on which, or the circumstances in which, the relevant Minister may revoke an exemption under this section, and (c) for an agreement with an employer whose registered business address is outside the metropolitan area--that the exemption cannot be revoked merely because the employer has only created between 20 and 29 new jobs (inclusive). (3) Subject to this section, wages are exempt wages if-- (a) they are paid or payable by an employer who enters into a Jobs Plus agreement, and (a1) they are paid or payable to a person in relation to a period-- (i) before 1 October 2028, and (ii) within the first 4 years of the exemption applying to wages for the person's position, and (b) they are wages of a kind that is specified by the agreement to be exempt wages under this section. (4) The relevant Minister may, by written notice issued to an employer who enters into a Jobs Plus agreement, revoke the exemption under this section on the grounds, or in the circumstances, specified by the agreement. (5) The effect of the revocation is as follows-- (a) the wages referred to in subsection (3) are taken never to have been exempt wages under this section, (b) the employer is liable to pay payroll tax on the wages even if the relevant Minister revokes the exemption under this section after the employer relies on the exemption as the reason for not paying payroll tax on the wages, (c) the Chief Commissioner must assess or reassess the employer's liability to pay payroll tax on the wages accordingly. (6) For the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1996, section 9(3)(c), the Chief Commissioner is authorised to make a reassessment under this section until 1 July 2033. (7) An employer who enters into a Jobs Plus agreement cannot lodge an objection with the Chief Commissioner under the Taxation Administration Act 1996, Part 10, Division 1 to an assessment or reassessment under this section on the grounds that the relevant Minister has revoked an exemption under this section. (8) Without limiting the Taxation Administration Act 1996, section 82 (b)(i), a Jobs Plus administrator may disclose to another Jobs Plus administrator information in relation to a Jobs Plus agreement, including personal information within the meaning of the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 and confidential information-- (a) to assist a Jobs Plus administrator to exercise a function under this section, including to assist the relevant Minister to give effect to the agreement, or (b) in connection with the administration of a taxation law. (9) The relevant Minister may delegate a function of the relevant Minister under this section to another Jobs Plus administrator, subject to the following-- (a) the relevant Minister cannot delegate a function to a tax officer, (b) the relevant Minister cannot delegate a function under subsection (1)(a) or (4) to any person other than the Chief Executive Officer of Investment NSW, (c) the relevant Minister cannot delegate this power of delegation. (10) The State, or a Jobs Plus administrator, does not incur civil liability in connection with the exercise of a function under this section. (11) The relevant Minister must, until 1 July 2029, cause to be tabled in each House of Parliament an annual report containing the following for each financial year-- (a) the total number of employers who entered into Jobs Plus agreements, (b) the total number of new jobs the employers agreed to create, as specified by the agreements, (c) the total number of new jobs in fact created by the employers, whether created in that financial year or an earlier financial year, (d) the total amount of payroll tax from which the employers were exempt under this section, whether in relation to that financial year or an earlier financial year.

Corporations A and B form\n          part of a chain of corporations, and corporation B is\n          linked to corporation A. Accordingly, an entity that has a\n          direct interest in corporation A also has an indirect\n          interest in corporation B,\n          (b) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation\n          C. In this case, corporations A, B and C form part of a\n          chain of corporations. Both corporations B and C are linked\n          to corporation A. The entity that has a direct interest in\n          corporation A has an indirect interest in both corporations\n          B and C,\n          (c) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation\n          D. There are now 2 chains of corporations, one consisting\n          of A, B and C, and one consisting of A, B and D.\n          Corporations B, C and D are all linked to corporation A and\n          an entity that has a direct interest in corporation A would\n          have an indirect interest in corporations B, C and D. An\n          entity that has a direct interest in corporation B would\n          have an indirect interest in corporations C and D. However,\n          an entity that has a direct interest in corporation C only\n          would not have an indirect interest in corporation D, as\n          corporation D is not linked to corporation C.\n     (4) The value of the indirect interest of an entity in a corporation\n     (an\n     \"indirectly controlled corporation\") that is linked to a directly\n     controlled corporation is calculated by multiplying together the\n     following--\n          (a) the value of the direct interest of the entity in the\n          directly controlled corporation,\n          (b) the value of each direct interest that forms a link in\n          the chain of corporations by which the indirectly\n          controlled corporation is linked to the directly controlled\n          corporation.\n     (5) The following are examples of how subsection (4) works (the\n     examples are cumulative)--\n          (a) an entity has a direct interest (with a value of 80%)\n          in corporation A. Corporation A has a direct interest (with\n          a value of 70%) in corporation B. The value of the indirect\n          interest of the entity in corporation B is 80% × 70% (that\n          is, 56%). Accordingly, in this example the entity has a\n          controlling interest (within the meaning of section 73\n          (Groups arising from tracing of interests in corporations))\n          in corporation B,\n          (b) corporation B also has a direct interest (with a value\n          of 40%) in corporation C. The value of the indirect\n          interest of the entity in corporation C is 80% × 70% × 40%\n          (that is, 22.4%). Accordingly, in this example the entity\n          does not have a controlling interest in corporation C.\n     (6) It is possible for an entity to have more than one indirect\n     interest in a corporation. This may occur if the corporation is\n     linked to more than one corporation in which the entity has a direct\n     interest, or if the corporation is linked to only one corporation in\n     which the entity has a direct interest but is linked through more\n     than one chain of corporations. In that case, the entity has an\n     aggregate interest in the corporation (see section 78 (Aggregation of\n     interests))."

    relevant 12-week period by means of a motor vehicle\n          provided or maintained by the person,\n               Note : Clause 15 defines the relevant 12-week\n               period.\n          (b) the specific purpose for which each such business\n          journey was taken,\n          (c) the distance travelled by the person during the\n          relevant 12-week period in the course of

travelled by each such vehicle during the\n          relevant 12-week period, calculated on the basis of the\n          odometer readings referred to in paragraph (d),\n          (f) the distance

during the\n          financial year, calculated on the basis of the odometer\n          readings referred to in paragraph (g),\n          (i) the distance travelled by the person in the course of\n

which odometer details are recorded in accordance\n     with subclause (1), an employer is not required to calculate the\n     relevant percentage, or record the details referred to in subclause\n     (1) (a)-(f), for the person but is required to record the other\n     details referred to in that subclause.\n     (3) Accordingly, for the next succeeding 4 financial years after the\n     first financial year in which odometer details are recorded in\n     accordance with subclause (1), the number of business kilometres\n     travelled during the financial year is to be calculated (as referred\n     to in subclause (1) (i)) on the basis of the relevant percentage\n     calculated for the first financial year.\n     (4) Despite subclauses (2) and (3), an employer is required to\n

for\n          any other reason.\n     (5) In a situation referred to in subclause (4), the new record for\n     the financial year replaces the relevant percentage details\n     previously recorded and subclauses (2) and (3) apply in relation to\n     the new record for the financial year as if it were the first\n     financial year in which odometer details were recorded.\n     (6) An employer who has adopted and employed the method of recording\n     referred to in subclauses (2) and (3) for a person for 4 successive\n     financial years must, in the next succeeding financial year, make a\n     fresh recording of all the details specified in subclause (1) if the\n     employer intends to continue to use the same method of recording for\n     the person. Subclauses (2) and (3) then apply in relation to the new\n     record for the financial year as if it were the first financial year\n     in which odometer details were recorded.\n     (7) If the odometer of a motor vehicle is replaced or recalibrated\n     during any period for which its readings are relevant for the\n     purposes of this clause, the odometer readings immediately before and\n     after the replacement or recalibration are to be recorded."
