     formula:
     (2) Where the percentage calculated for a year in accordance with
     this clause is smaller than 0.1 per cent, or is nil, there shall be
     deemed to be no adjustment percentage for that year.
     (3) Where pursuant to subclause (2), but not otherwise, there is
     deemed to be no adjustment percentage for a year, then, for the
     purposes of calculating the adjustment percentage for the next year:

          (b) the amounts or numbers shown for the relevant quarter
          or reference period of the last year for which there was an

          the later amount or number shall be disregarded, or
          (b) if the Minister so directs--regard shall, after the
          direction is given, be had to the later and not to the
          earlier amount or number so published,
     for the purposes of this Schedule.
     (5) Notwithstanding subclause (4), if at any time after the
     commencement of this Schedule the Australian Statistician changes the
     reference base in connection with any amounts or numbers included in
     any document published by the Australian Statistician and referred to
     in subclause (1), then, for the purposes of the application of this
     clause after the change takes place, regard shall, unless the
     Minister otherwise directs, be had to amounts or numbers published in
     terms of the new reference base instead of the former reference base.
     (6) Where a percentage that is to be calculated in accordance with
     this clause is or includes a fraction of one-tenth of 1 per cent:
          (a) if that fraction is less than one-half of one-tenth of
          1 per cent--that fraction shall be disregarded, and
          (b) if that fraction is not less than one-half of one-tenth
          of 1 per cent--that fraction shall be treated as one-tenth
          of 1 per cent.
     (7) The Governor may, by order published in the Gazette before the
     operative date for a particular year, specify an annual percentage
     change for the purposes of the formula in subclause (1) for that
     year. That percentage is taken to be the annual percentage change
     ascertained in accordance with this Schedule.
     (8) An order may be made under subclause (7) only if the Minister
     certifies to the Governor that:
          (a) the Minister considers the order to be necessary
          because information referred to in subclause (1) is not
          available or for any other reason, and
          (b) the percentage to be specified in the order was
          calculated in accordance with estimates made having regard
          to, and by reference to, such relevant information as was
          reasonably available.
3 Governor may specify a different percentage
     (1) Subject to this clause, the Governor may, by regulation:
          (a) specify a percentage for a year, by way of increase or
          reduction as specified therein, which shall for the
          purposes of this Schedule be deemed to be the adjustment
          percentage for that year, by way of increase or reduction
          as so specified, instead of any adjustment percentage
          calculated for that year in accordance with clause 2, or
          (b) declare that there shall be no adjustment percentage
          for a year, in which case there shall for the purposes of
          this Schedule be deemed to be no such percentage.
     (2) A regulation made for the purposes of subclause (1) (a) shall not
     have effect in respect of the adjustment percentage for a year if the
     application of the percentage specified in the regulation would
     result in the prescribed rate being greater than the prescribed rate
     that would be applicable from the operative date in the following
     year had this clause never been in force.
     (3) A regulation made for the purposes of subclause (1) shall not
     have effect in respect of the adjustment percentage for a year unless
     it is published in the Gazette before the operative date in the
     following year.
4 Adjustment of prescribed rate
     (1) Subject to this Schedule, where there is an adjustment percentage
     for a year, the prescribed rate (as adjusted by the previous
     operation, if any, of this subclause) is hereby adjusted, on and from
     the operative date in the following year, by that percentage.
