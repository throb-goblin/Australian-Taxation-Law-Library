Only surchargeable contributions calculated for a period after 7.30 pm on 20  August 1996 are subject to surcharge.(c) For a defined benefits superannuation scheme, the surcharge is payable on an amount calculated to be the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year.(d) If, after the assessment of surcharge, the member&#39;s adjusted taxable income is found to be different from the amount that was previously calculated or the surchargeable contributions are found to be different from the amount on which the assessment was based, the Commissioner may amend the assessment.(e) The member is liable to pay the surcharge on the member&#39;s surchargeable contributions for a financial year, but the surcharge is not payable before benefits become payable.(f) If liability for surcharge is increased as a result of an amendment of an assessment, interest is payable on the additional surcharge.(g) A member may object against an assessment of surcharge in the way set out in Part  IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 for objecting against assessments of income tax.(h) A late payment penalty applies if surcharge is not paid on time."

Work out the amount that would have been the taxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 83 component of the eligible termination payment if the amount of the excessive component of the eligible termination payment had been nil.Step 2. Work out the taxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 83 component of the eligible termination payment.Step 3. Subtract the result of step 2 from the result of step 1.Step 4. Divide the result of step 3 by 0.85.Step 5. Subtract the result of step 3 from the result of step 4.Step 6. Add the result of step 5 to the excessive component of the eligible termination payment.Step 7. Identify the amount of the surchargeable contributions (apart from subsection (9)) of the member reported for the financial year by the entity that paid the eligible termination payment.Step 8. Identify the lesser of the results of steps 6 and 7 (or either result if they are the same)."

Account to be debited for surcharge (3) The Commissioner is to debit the account for surcharge assessed to be payable on the member&#39;s surchargeable contributions. Interest to be debited (4) If the member&#39;s account is in debit at the end of a financial year, the Commissioner is to debit the account for interest on the amount by which the account is in debit, calculated at the Treasury bond rate for the last day of the financial year for bonds with a 10 year term. Rate of interest (5) The Treasury bond rate for the last day of a financial year for bonds with a 10 year term is: (a) if any Treasury bonds with that term were issued on that day--the annual yield on those bonds; or (b) otherwise--the annual yield on Treasury bonds with that term, as published by the Reserve Bank of Australia for that day. Payment to be made when benefit becomes payable (6) Subject to subsection (6AA), when a superannuation benefit (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) becomes payable by a superannuation provider for the benefit of a member whose surcharge debt account is in debit, the member is liable to pay to the Commissioner the lesser of: (a) the amount by which the account is in debit; or (b) the total of the following amounts: (i) 15% of the employer -financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the member that accrued between 20 August 1996 and 1 July 2003; (ii) 14.5% of the employer -financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the member that accrued in the 2003-2004 financial year; (iii) 12.5% of the employer -financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the member that accrued in the 2004-2005 financial year. (6AA) If: (a) a payment split applies to a splittable payment in respect of an interest that a person has as a member; and (b) the splittable payment becomes payable in circumstances where the member&#39;s surcharge account is in debit; then the member is liable to pay to the Commissioner the lesser of: (c) the amount by which the account is in debit; and (d) the total of the following amounts: (i) 15% of the employer -financed component of any part of the benefits that would have been payable to the member but for the payment split and that accrued between 20 August 1996 and 1 July 2003; (ii) 14.5% of the employer -financed component of any part of the benefits that would have been payable to the member but for the payment split and that accrued in the 2003-2004 financial year; (iii) 12.5% of the employer -financed component of any part of the benefits that would have been payable to the member but for the payment split and that accrued in the 2004-2005 financial year. Payment to be made if fund ceases to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund (6A) If a superannuation fund ceases to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund at a time when a member&#39;s surcharge debt account is in debit, the member is liable to pay to the Commissioner the lesser of: (a) the amount by which the account is in debit; or (b) the total of the following amounts: (i) 15% of the employer -financed component of any part of the value of the age retirement benefits of the member when the fund ceased to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund that accrued between 20 August 1996 and 1 July 2003; (ii) 14.5% of the employer -financed component of any part of the value of the age retirement benefits of the member when the fund ceased to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund that accrued in the 2003 -2004 financial year; (iii) 12.5% of the employer -financed component of any part of the value of the age retirement benefits of the member when the fund ceased to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund that accrued in the 2004 -2005 financial year.
