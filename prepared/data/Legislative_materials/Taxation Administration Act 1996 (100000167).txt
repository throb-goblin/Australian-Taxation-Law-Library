         (2)         The assessment must be served on the taxpayer concerned.

amount to which it relates is affected by failure to serve the assessment on the
taxpayer.

a tax does not constitute the making of an assessment of tax
liability.

nature.

as a result of a tax avoidance scheme is the amount of tax, or the amount of
additional tax, that would have been payable by the person, or that is

carries out for the sole or dominant purpose of enabling liability for tax to be
avoided or reduced.

         (2)         It does not matter that the scheme is entered into, made or carried
out wholly or partly outside South Australia.

         (3)         In determining the sole or dominant purpose for which a scheme is
entered into, made or carried out, any purpose relating to avoiding, reducing or
postponing a liability for foreign tax is to be disregarded.

         (4)         In this section--

Section 40D
40D--Matters
relevant to whether scheme is tax avoidance scheme

The following matters are taken into account in determining whether a
scheme is a tax avoidance scheme, and whether it is of an artificial, blatant or
contrived nature:

             (a)         the way in which the scheme was entered into, made or carried
out;

             (b)         the form and substance of the scheme, including--

                   (i)         the legal rights and obligations involved in the scheme; and

                   (ii)         the economic and commercial substance of the scheme;

             (c)         when the scheme was entered into or made and the length of the period
during which the scheme was carried out;

             (d)         the purpose of the relevant taxation law or any provision of the
relevant taxation law (whether or not that purpose is expressly
stated);

             (e)         the effect that the relevant taxation law would have in relation to
the scheme apart from this Part;

             (f)         any change in any person's financial position, or other circumstances,
that has resulted, will result, or may reasonably be expected to result, from
the scheme;

             (g)         the nature of any connection, whether of a business, family or other
nature, between the person whose liability for duty is avoided or reduced as a
result of the scheme and any other person whose financial position or other
circumstances have changed, will change, or may reasonably be expected to
change, as a result of the scheme;

             (h)         the circumstances surrounding the scheme.

TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT 1996

Section 40E
40E--Liability
to pay avoidance tax

         (1)         A liability to pay an amount of tax avoided by a person as a result of
a tax avoidance scheme is taken to arise on the date the amount of tax avoided
would have been payable if the tax avoidance scheme had not been entered into or
made.

         (2)         Accordingly, a tax default is taken to have occurred on the date the
amount of tax avoided would have been payable if the tax avoidance scheme had
not been entered into or made.

         (3)         The tax default will be taken to be a deliberate tax default under
Part 5.

         (4)         This section applies only if the Commissioner issues a notice of
assessment, or reassessment, of liability for tax on the basis that a scheme is
a tax avoidance scheme of an artificial, blatant or contrived nature.

TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT 1996

Section 40F
40F--Reasons
for decision to be given

A notice of assessment, or reassessment, of liability for tax that is
issued by the Commissioner on the basis that a scheme is a tax avoidance scheme
of an artificial, blatant or contrived nature is to be accompanied by a
statement of the Commissioner's reasons for making the assessment or
reassessment.

40G--Innocent
participants

         (1)         A person is liable under this Part to pay an amount of tax avoided by
the person as a result of a tax avoidance scheme whether or not the person
entered into, made or carried out the relevant tax avoidance scheme.

         (2)         However, a person is not liable to pay an amount of tax avoided by the
person as a result of a tax avoidance scheme if the Commissioner is satisfied
that it would be unfair to impose a liability for tax in the circumstances of
the particular case.

to pay the tax or the power of the Commissioner to recover it.

TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT 1996

Section 105
105--Public
officer of corporation

         (1)         The Commissioner
may, by written notice served on a corporation, require the corporation to
appoint, within a period specified in the notice, a natural person whose
principal place of residence is in this jurisdiction as a public officer of the
corporation for the purposes of the taxation laws, and to keep the office of
public officer constantly filled by such a person.

         (2)         An appointment of a public officer is not duly made until written
notice of the appointment, specifying the name and residential address of the
officer, has been lodged with the Commissioner.

         (3)         If--

             (a)         the Commissioner has required a corporation to appoint a public
officer; and

             (b)         the corporation--

                   (i)         does not make such an appointment as required; or

                   (ii)         does not keep the office of public officer constantly filled as
required,

the Commissioner may appoint a person as the public officer of the
corporation by written notice served on the person and the
corporation.

         (4)         Service of a document on the public officer of the corporation is
sufficient service on the corporation for the purposes of a taxation law, and,
if at any time the corporation does not have a public officer as required under
this section, then service on a person acting or appearing to act in the
business of the corporation is sufficient.

         (5)         The public officer is answerable for the discharge of all obligations
imposed on the corporation under a taxation law, and, in case of default, is
liable to the same penalties.

         (6)         Everything that the public officer is required to do and does in his
or her representative capacity is to be taken to have been done by the
corporation, but the absence or non-appointment of a public officer does not
excuse the corporation from the necessity of complying, or from a penalty for
failure to comply, with a provision of a taxation law and the corporation is
liable to comply with the taxation laws as if there were no requirement to
appoint a public officer.

         (7)         A document served on or requirement made of the public officer is to
be taken to have been served on or made of the corporation.

         (8)         Any criminal or civil proceedings brought under a taxation law against
the public officer are to be taken to have been brought against the corporation,
and the corporation is liable jointly with the public officer for any penalty
imposed on the public officer, or for compliance with any order made against the
public officer.

         (9)         A decision under subsection (1) is a non-reviewable
decision.

             (b)         by leaving it at the last address of the person known to the
Commissioner (including, in the case of a corporation, the registered address or
a business address of the corporation); or

             (c)         by post addressed to the person at the last address of the person
known to the Commissioner (including, in the case of a corporation, the
registered address or a business address of the corporation); or

             (d)         by a means indicated by the person as being an available means of
service (such as by facsimile transmission or by delivering it, addressed to the
person, to the facilities of a document exchange); or

             (e)         by any means provided for the service of the document by another Act
or law.

         (2)         If a person (the "agent") has actual or ostensible
authority to accept service of a document on behalf of another, the Commissioner
may, for the purposes of a taxation law, serve the document on the agent as if
the agent were that other person.

         (3)         Service of a document on a member of a partnership, or on a member of
the committee of management of an unincorporated association or other body of
persons, is to be taken, for the purposes of a taxation law, to constitute
service of the document on each member of the partnership, or on each member of
the association or other body of persons, as the case may be.
