(3) To the extent to which any such provision takes effect from a date that is earlier than the date of its publication in the Gazette, the provision does not operate so as-- (a) to affect, in a manner prejudicial to any person (other than the State or an authority of the State), the rights of that person existing before the date of its publication, or (b) to impose liabilities on any person (other than the State or an authority of the State) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of its publication. Section 2 Provision consequent on enactment of State Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2010 The amendments made to section 5 and Schedule 1 by the State Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2010 do not affect any motor vehicle tax that was or is payable in relation to the registration or renewal of registration of a motor vehicle if that registration or renewal was required before 1 July 2010. Accordingly, any such motor vehicle tax is payable in accordance with this Act as in force before the commencement of those amendments. Section 3 Provision consequent on enactment of Road Transport Legislation Amendment Act 2021 An exemption from the payment of motor vehicle tax granted by the Minister under section 17 before the commencement of the Road Transport Legislation Amendment Act 2021 continues in force as if it were a declaration by the Minister under the Road Transport Act 2013, section 19 until-- (a) it is rescinded, revoked or repealed under the Road Transport Act 2013, section 19(2), or (b) if the exemption is expressed to operate for a fixed period of time, the expiry of the period.

(3) To the extent to which any such provision takes effect from a date that is earlier than the date of its publication in the Gazette, the provision does not operate so as-- (a) to affect, in a manner prejudicial to any person (other than the State or an authority of the State), the rights of that person existing before the date of its publication, or (b) to impose liabilities on any person (other than the State or an authority of the State) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of its publication. Section 2 Provision consequent on enactment of State Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2010 The amendments made to section 5 and Schedule 1 by the State Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2010 do not affect any motor vehicle tax that was or is payable in relation to the registration or renewal of registration of a motor vehicle if that registration or renewal was required before 1 July 2010. Accordingly, any such motor vehicle tax is payable in accordance with this Act as in force before the commencement of those amendments. Section 3 Provision consequent on enactment of Road Transport Legislation Amendment Act 2021 An exemption from the payment of motor vehicle tax granted by the Minister under section 17 before the commencement of the Road Transport Legislation Amendment Act 2021 continues in force as if it were a declaration by the Minister under the Road Transport Act 2013, section 19 until-- (a) it is rescinded, revoked or repealed under the Road Transport Act 2013, section 19(2), or (b) if the exemption is expressed to operate for a fixed period of time, the expiry of the period.

(3) To the extent to which any such provision takes effect from a date that is earlier than the date of its publication in the Gazette, the provision does not operate so as-- (a) to affect, in a manner prejudicial to any person (other than the State or an authority of the State), the rights of that person existing before the date of its publication, or (b) to impose liabilities on any person (other than the State or an authority of the State) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of its publication. Section 2 Provision consequent on enactment of State Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2010 The amendments made to section 5 and Schedule 1 by the State Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2010 do not affect any motor vehicle tax that was or is payable in relation to the registration or renewal of registration of a motor vehicle if that registration or renewal was required before 1 July 2010. Accordingly, any such motor vehicle tax is payable in accordance with this Act as in force before the commencement of those amendments. Section 3 Provision consequent on enactment of Road Transport Legislation Amendment Act 2021 An exemption from the payment of motor vehicle tax granted by the Minister under section 17 before the commencement of the Road Transport Legislation Amendment Act 2021 continues in force as if it were a declaration by the Minister under the Road Transport Act 2013, section 19 until-- (a) it is rescinded, revoked or repealed under the Road Transport Act 2013, section 19(2), or (b) if the exemption is expressed to operate for a fixed period of time, the expiry of the period.
