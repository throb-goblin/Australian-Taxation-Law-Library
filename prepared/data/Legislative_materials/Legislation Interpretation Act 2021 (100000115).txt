best achieving purpose or object

         (1)         In interpreting a provision of an Act or a legislative instrument, the
interpretation that best achieves the purpose or object of the Act or the
instrument (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act
or instrument) is to be preferred to any other interpretation.

         (2)         This section
does not operate to create or extend any criminal liability.

LEGISLATION INTERPRETATION ACT 2021

Section 15
15--Interpretation
so as not to exceed legislative power

         (1)         An Act or a legislative instrument is to be interpreted as operating
to the full extent of, but so as not to exceed, the legislative power of the
State.

         (2)         A legislative instrument made under an Act is to be interpreted as
operating to the full extent of, but so as not to exceed, the power to make the
instrument conferred by the Act.

         (3)         If a provision of an Act or a legislative instrument would, but for
this section, be interpreted as being in excess of power, the provision is valid
to the extent to which it is not in excess of power.

LEGISLATION INTERPRETATION ACT 2021

Section 16
16--Use
of extrinsic material in interpretation 

         (1)         In the
interpretation of a provision of an Act or a legislative instrument, if any
material not forming part of the Act or instrument is capable of assisting in
the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to
that material--

             (a)         to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning
conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the
Act or instrument and the purpose or object underlying the Act or instrument
and, in the case of a legislative instrument, the purpose or object underlying
the Act under which the instrument was made); or

             (b)         to determine the meaning of the provision--

                   (i)         if the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or

                   (ii)         if the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking
into account its context in the Act or instrument and the purpose or object
underlying the Act or instrument and, in the case of a legislative instrument,
the purpose or object underlying the Act under which the instrument was made)
leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.

         (2)         Without limiting the effect of subsection (1), the material that
may be considered in accordance with that subsection in the interpretation of a
provision includes the following:

             (a)         all matters not forming part of the Act or instrument that are set out
in the document containing the text of the Act or instrument as printed or
published by the Government Printer or as published under the Legislation
Revision and Publication Act 2002;

             (b)         any relevant report of a Royal Commission, Law Reform Commission,
committee of inquiry or other similar body that was laid before either House of
the Parliament before the provision was enacted or made;

             (c)         any relevant report of a committee of the Parliament or of either
House of the Parliament before the provision was enacted or made;

             (d)         any treaty or other international agreement that is referred to in the
Act;

             (e)         any explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill for the Act, or any
other relevant document, that was laid before, or furnished to the members of,
either House of the Parliament by a Minister or other member of Parliament
introducing the Bill before the provision was enacted or made;

             (f)         the speech made to a House of Parliament by a Minister or other member
of Parliament on the occasion of the moving by that Minister or member of a
motion that the Bill for the Act be read a second time in that House;

             (g)         any document (whether or not a document to which a preceding paragraph
applies) that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document for the purposes
of this section;

             (h)         any relevant material in the Minutes of Proceedings or the Votes and
Proceedings of either House of Parliament or in any official record of debates
in Parliament or either House of Parliament.

         (3)         In determining whether consideration should be given to any material,
or in considering the weight to be given to any material, regard must be had, in
addition to any other relevant matters, to--

             (a)         the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning
conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the
Act or instrument and the purpose or object underlying the Act or instrument
and, in the case of a legislative instrument, the purpose or object underlying
the Act under which the instrument was made); and

             (b)         the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without
compensating advantage.

of presumption that re-enactment etc constitutes Parliamentary approval of prior

22--Determining
whether Act or instrument binds Crown

         (1)         Subject to subsection (2), an Act passed, or a legislative
instrument made, after 20 June 1990 will, unless the contrary
intention appears (either expressly or by implication), be taken to bind the
Crown, but not so as to impose any criminal liability on the Crown.

         (2)         If an Act
passed, or a legislative instrument made, after 20 June 1990 amends an
Act passed, or a legislative instrument made, before that date, the question
whether the amendment binds the Crown will be determined in accordance with
subsection (3).

         (3)         An Act passed, or a
legislative instrument made, on or before 20 June 1990 will only be
taken to bind the Crown if the Act or instrument expressly, or by necessary
implication, binds the Crown.

         (4)         If an Act or a legislative instrument, or a provision of an Act or a
legislative instrument, (whether passed or made before or after
20 June 1990) binds the Crown but not so as to impose any criminal
liability on the Crown, the Crown's immunity from criminal liability extends
(unless the contrary intention is expressed) to an agent of the Crown in respect
of an act within the scope of the agent's obligations.

         (5)         If an Act or a legislative instrument, or a provision of an Act or a
legislative instrument, (whether passed or made before or after
20 June 1990) does not bind the Crown, the Crown's immunity extends
(unless the contrary intention is expressed) to an agent of the Crown in respect
of an act within the scope of the agent's obligations.

         (6)         For the purposes of this section--

             (a)         a reference to the Crown extends not only to the Crown in right of
this State but also (so far as the legislative power of the State permits) to
the Crown in any other capacity; and

             (b)         a reference to an agent of the Crown extends to an instrumentality,
officer or employee of the Crown or a contractor or other person who carries out
functions on behalf of the Crown; and

             (c)         an agent acts within the scope of the agent's obligations if the act
is reasonably required for carrying out of obligations or functions imposed on,
or assigned to, the agent.

entity.

         (2)         If the Act provides for the non-government entity to nominate a panel
of persons from which the Governor or Minister is to select a person for
appointment, the Act will be taken to provide that the panel--

             (b)         must, as far as practicable, be comprised of equal numbers of women
and men.

         (3)         If the Act does not provide for the non-government entity to nominate

of not less than twice the number of members of the body to be appointed on the
nomination of the entity plus 1; and

a person or body to delegate a function.

         (2)         A delegation may be made subject to conditions or limitations
specified by the delegator and may be revoked at any time by the
delegator.

         (3)         Unless the Act or the legislative instrument expressly provides to the
contrary, a delegation of the power of delegation cannot be made (and any
purported delegation of all of the functions of the delegator will be read as if
the delegation referred to all of the functions of the delegator other than the
power of delegation).

         (4)         If a function, when
exercised by a delegator, is dependent on the delegator's opinion, belief or
state of mind in relation to a matter, the function, when exercised by a
delegate, is dependent on the delegate's opinion, belief or state of mind in
relation to that matter.

         (5)         A function that has been delegated, when exercised by a delegate, will
be taken to have been exercised by the delegator.

         (6)         A function that has been delegated may, despite the delegation, be
exercised by the delegator.

         (7)         The delegator may delegate the function to a person or body by name or
by reference to the title of an office held by a person or body. 

         (8)         A delegation made to the holder of a particular office will be taken
to be made to the person for the time being holding or performing the duties of
the office.

         (9)         A delegation of all the functions of a person or body under an Act or
a legislative instrument, or a provision of an Act or a legislative instrument,
includes any additional function given to the delegator under the Act,
instrument or provision by an amendment made to it after the delegation has
taken effect.

         (10)         If a function of a person or body under an Act or a legislative
instrument is delegated and, after the delegation has taken effect, the scope of
that function is altered by an amendment made to the Act or the instrument, the
delegation is of the function as so altered.

         (11)         A delegation made by, or to, the holder of a particular office does
not cease to have effect merely because the person who held the office when the
function was delegated ceases to do so.

         (12)         The validity of a delegation is not affected by a grammatical error,
spelling error, error of punctuation, formatting error or other minor error if
the scope and meaning of the delegation is readily apparent despite the
error.
