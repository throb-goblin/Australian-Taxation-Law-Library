The assistance agencies give the matching agency the basic data about\npersons that is held by those agencies for the purposes of personal\nassistance.\n  2. The matching agency checks the validity of the TFN data given under\nparagraph 1 by using any algorithm given to it for the purposes of this Act by\nthe tax agency.\n  3. Where the check identifies TFN data that is invalid, the matching agency\nchecks that data using any personal identity data given to it for the purposes\nof this Act by the Australian Electoral Office or the Health Insurance\nCommission, not being data relating to a person's use of Medicare or the\nPharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\n  4. Where either of the checks identifies TFN data that appears to be\nincorrect, the matching agency gives particulars of the data to the source\nagency that gave it.\n                               STEP 2\n  5. The matching agency extracts from data given to it in Step 1 the TFN\ndata, and any identification numbers for the purposes of personal assistance,\nof assisted persons.\n  6. The matching agency gives the tax agency the data extracted under\nparagraph 5.\n                               STEP 3\n  7. The tax agency uses tax data and data given to it under Step 2 to find\nout the following available and current data in respect of each person who has\na tax file number:\n  (a)  tax file number;\n  (b)  personal identity data;\n  (c)  declared income;\n  (d)  spouse rebate.\n  8. The tax agency gives the matching agency the data found out under\nparagraph 7 and any identification numbers for the purposes of personal\nassistance of the person.\n                                STEP 4\n  9. The matching agency carries out identity matching by matching the\npersonal identity data given under paragraph 8 with the family identity data\ngiven to it.\n  10. Where the matching shows a discrepancy in the family identity data or\npersonal identity data of a person, the matching agency matches that data with\nthe personal identity data referred to in paragraph 3.\n  11. Where, after matching under paragraph 10, there is an unresolved\ndiscrepancy in data given to the matching agency by a source agency, the\nmatching agency gives the source agency particulars of the discrepancy.\n                            STEP 5\n  12. The matching agency carries out payment matching by matching family\nidentity data given by assistance agencies in Step 1 to find out if personal\nassistance is being, or has been, given to, or is being claimed by, persons\nwho might not be entitled to it.\n  13. Where the matching of family identity data given by assistance agencies\nin Step 1 cannot identify a person for the purposes of paragraph 12, the\nmatching agency matches TFN data given to it inStep 1 with the data being\nmatched under that paragraph.\n  14. The matching agency carries out income matching of persons by using any\nidentification number for the purposes of personal assistance of a person to\nmatch:\n  (a)  income data of the person given to it by assistance agencies (other\nthan the Department of Community Services and Health); and\n  (b)  except where the matching agency has, under paragraph 11, given\nparticulars of a discrepancy in data about the person to a source agency, the\ntax income data of the person given to the matching agency in earlier steps;\nto find out if there are any inconsistencies in the income data of the person.\n                              STEP 6\n  15. The matching agency gives to each source agency the results of matching\nunder earlier steps that are of concern to that other agency and have not been\ngiven to the other agency in an earlier step, being results that indicate:\n  (a)  in the case of an assistance agency - that personal assistance is\nbeing, or has been, given to, or is being claimed by, persons who might not be\nentitled to it; or\n  (b)  in the case of the tax agency - that a person might be evading, or\nmight have evaded, tax.\n  16. Information exchanged in paragraph 15 must not include the return of TFN\ndata from the matching agency to an assistance agency.\nDATA-MATCHING PROGRAM (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) ACT 1990 No. 20 of 1991"

DATA-MATCHING PROGRAM (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) ACT 1990 No. 20 of 1991 - SCHEDULE SCHEDULE Section 12 DATA-MATCHING PROGRAM (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) GUIDELINES Scope of Operation Section 1. These Guidelines apply to, and only to, the matching program referred to in the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act Section 1990 (\"the Act\"). Definitions Section 2.1 Any term used in these Guidelines has: (i) where it is defined in the Act, that meaning; or (ii) where it is not defined in the Act but is defined in the Privacy Act 1988, that meaning. Section 2.2 In addition the following terms used in these Guidelines have the following meanings: (a) \"Program\" refers to the data-matching program as defined in the Act; (b) \"Discrepancy\" refers to a result of the program which warrants further action by any relevant data agency for the purposes of giving effect to the program; (c) \"action\" refers to the actions set out in section 10 of the Act. Basis of Program Section 3.1 A program protocol must be prepared by the matching agency in consultation with the source agencies before 1 April 1991 and must - (i) identify the matching agency and the source agencies; (ii) in the case of each data agency, set out the legal basis for any collection, use or disclosure of personal information involved in the program; (iii) outline the objectives of the program, the procedures to be employed, the nature and frequency of the matching covered by the program, and the justifications for the program; (iv) explain what methods other than data-matching were available and why they were rejected; (v) detail any cost/benefit analysis or other measures of effectiveness which were taken into account in deciding to initiate the program; (vi) outline the technical controls proposed to ensure data quality, integrity and security in the conduct of the program; (vii) provide an explanation for any use of identification numbers and, in particular, the tax file numbers; (viii) outline the nature of the action proposed to be taken in relation to the results of the program including the pro formas of any letters to be used by source agencies when providing notice under section 11 of the Act; (ix) indicate what form of notice, if any, of the proposed activities in relation to their personal information has been given or is intended to be given to affected individuals; and (x) specify any time-limits on the conduct of the program. The Program Protocol must be filed with the Privacy Commissioner and available for public inspection unless the Privacy Commissioner is satisfied that to do so would be or would be likely to be contrary to the public interest (e.g. by prejudicing the integrity of legitimate investigative methods). Section 3.2 Agencies must comply with the Program Protocol. Section 3.3 Source agencies must take all reasonable steps to ensure that their clients are informed that a Program Protocol which outlines the nature and purposes of the data-matching program is available from the Privacy Commissioner. Technical Standards in relation to data quality, integrity and security Section 4.1 Technical Standards Report: Detailed technical standards must be established by the matching agency to govern the conduct of the program. They should deal with the following matters: (i) integrity of data supplied by source agencies, referring in particular to: key terms and their definition, relevance, timeliness and completeness; (ii) matching techniques, referring in particular to: the matching algorithm, any use of identification numbers especially tax file numbers, the nature of the matters being sought to be identified by the matching process, the relevant data definitions and the procedure for recognising matches; (iii) controls being employed to ensure the continued integrity of the program including the procedures that have been established to confirm the validity of matching results; (iv) security features included within the program to minimise and audit access to personal information. Section 4.2 These matters should be dealt with in a Technical Standards Report to be held by the matching agency and copies held by the source agencies. A draft Report must be finalised before 1 April Section 1991 and the final report before 1 July 1991, taking account of initial experience of the operation of the program. Any subsequent variations to the technical standards should be the subject of a Variation Report appended to the original Report.

Any subsequent variations to the technical standards should be the subject of a Variation Report appended to the original Report. Section 4.3 The Privacy Commissioner has the power to require that the content of the draft and final Technical Standards Reports be varied. Non-compliance with the variations will be taken as a breach of the Guidelines and be subject to investigation in accordance with section 13 of the Act. Section 4.4 Agencies must comply with the Technical Standards Report. Safeguards for individuals affected by the results of programs Fairness Section 5.1 The source agencies must establish reasonable procedures for confirming the validity of results before relying on them as a basis for administrative action against an individual, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that such results are not likely to be in error. In forming that view, regard is to be had to the consistency in content and context of data being matched. Section 5.2 Where such confirmation procedures do not take the form of checking the results against the source data but instead involve direct communication with the affected individual, the source agency shall notify the affected individual that no check has been made against the records which formed the basis for the data supplied for the program. The notification must include (either in the letter or by way of an attachment) an explanation of the procedures that are involved in the examination of a discrepancy as well as the rights of complaint under the Privacy Act 1988. Section 5.3 If there is a dispute as to the accuracy of the data or the proposed action which the source agency does not concede, it must inform the individual of the rights of complaint conferred by the Privacy Act 1988. Any further action taken by the agency must, unless otherwise provided by law, not interfere with an individual's opportunity to exercise any rights of appeal or review. Section 5.4 Wherever data supplied by a person prior to 1 January 1991, is to be used, or is likely to be used, in a data-matching program, the person who has supplied the data shall be notified in writing either before the data is first used or as soon as practicable thereafter that the data is likely to be used for this purpose. Record Controls Section 6.1 No Discrepancy: Personal information used in a matching cycle that does not lead to a discrepancy must be destroyed by the matching agency as soon as is practicable after the beginning of Step 5 in the cycle. In any case, destruction of the information must not occur later than 24 hours after the beginning of Step 5 of the cycle unless additional time is required because of a computer malfunction or industrial action. Section 6.2 Discrepancy: In cases where a discrepancy occurs as a result of Steps 1, 4 and 5 in a data-matching cycle, the results must be supplied to the relevant source agency within 7 days of completion of the relevant step. Source agencies must deal with the results in accordance with section 10 of the Act. If, during the period referred to in that section or at any later time, a decision not to take further action is made, wherever practicable the information must be destroyed within 14 days. Section 6.3 On final completion of the action commenced in accordance with section 10 (1) of the Act, all information which gave rise to such action is to be destroyed. For the purposes of this guideline \"final completion of the action\" means: (i) in the situation where, at the expiration of twelve months from the commencement of action in accordance with section 10 (1), the case is under the control of the Australian Federal Police and is proceeding to the satisfaction of the source agency - when all investigation action, legal proceedings and repayment of debts due to the Commonwealth is finalised; (ii) in the situation where, at the expiration of twelve months from the commencement of action in accordance with section 10 (1), the case is under the control of the Director of Public Prosecutions and is proceeding to the satisfaction of the source agency - when all legal proceedings and repayment of debts due to the Commonwealth are finalised; (iii) in the situation"
