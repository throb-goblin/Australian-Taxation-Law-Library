(2) Trustees or personal representatives may appoint any person to act as their agent or attorney for the purpose of selling, converting, collecting, getting in, and executing and perfecting assurances of, or managing or cultivating, or otherwise administering any property, real or personal, moveable or immoveable, subject to the trust or forming part of the testator's or intestate's estate, in any place outside Victoria or executing or exercising any discretion or trust or power vested in them in relation to any such property, with such ancillary powers, and with and subject to such provisions and restrictions as they think fit, including a power to appoint substitutes, and shall not, by reason only of their having made such appointment, be responsible for any loss arising thereby. S. 28(3) amended by No. 11/2001 s. 3(Sch. item 81.3). (3) Without prejudice to such general power of appointing agents as aforesaid&#8212; S. 28(3)(a) amended by No. 18/2005 s. 18(Sch. 1 item 109.2). (a) a trustee may appoint a legal practitioner or a banker to be his agent to receive and give a discharge for any money or valuable consideration or property receivable by the trustee under the trust, by permitting the legal practitioner or banker to have the custody of, and to produce, a deed or instrument under the Transfer of Land Act 1958, having in the body thereof or endorsed thereon a receipt for such money or valuable consideration or property, the deed or instrument being executed, or the endorsed receipt being signed, by the person entitled to give a receipt for that consideration[5]; S. 28(3)(b) amended by No. 18/2005 s. 18(Sch. 1 item 109.2). (b) a trustee shall not be chargeable with breach of trust by reason only of his having made or concurred in making any such appointment; and the production of any such deed or instrument by the legal practitioner or banker shall have the same statutory validity and effect as if the person appointing the legal practitioner or banker had not been a trustee; S. 28(3)(c) amended by No. 18/2005 s. 18(Sch. 1 item 109.2). (c) a trustee may appoint a legal practitioner or a banker to be his agent to receive and give a discharge for any money payable to the trustee under or by virtue of a policy of insurance, by permitting the legal practitioner or banker to have the custody of and to produce the policy of insurance with a receipt signed by the trustee, and a trustee shall not be chargeable with a breach of trust by reason only of his having made or concurred in making any such appointment. In this subsection \"instrument\" includes a discharge of mortgage and \"banker\" means a person acting in his official capacity as general manager or manager of any company solely or chiefly engaged in the ordinary business of banking or as the manager conducting for such company the business of any branch of an authorised deposit-taking institution. S. 28(4) amended by No. 18/2005 s. 18(Sch. 1 item 109.2). (4) Nothing in the last preceding subsection shall exempt a trustee from any liability which he would have incurred if this Act or any corresponding previous enactment had not been passed, in case he permits any such money, valuable consideration or property to remain in the hands or under the control of the legal practitioner or banker for a period longer than is reasonably necessary to enable the legal practitioner or banker (as the case may be) to pay or transfer the same to the trustee. S. 28(5) inserted by No. 9/2002 s. 3(Sch. item 14.2).

(a) If any such person&#8212; (i) attains the age of eighteen years, or marries under that age, and his interest in such income during his minority or until his marriage is a vested interest; or (ii) on attaining the age of eighteen years or on marriage under that age becomes entitled to the property from which such income arose in fee-simple, absolute or determinable, or absolutely, or for an entailed interest&#8212; the trustees shall hold the accumulations in trust for such person absolutely, but without prejudice to any provision with respect thereto contained in any settlement by him made under any statutory powers during his minority, and so that the receipt of such person after marriage, and though still a minor, shall be a good discharge; and (b) In any other case the trustees shall, notwithstanding that such person had a vested interest in such income, hold the accumulations as an accretion to the capital of the property from which such accumulations arose, and as one fund with such capital for all purposes, and so that if such property is settled land, such accumulations shall be held upon the same trusts as if the same were capital money arising therefrom&#8212; but the trustees may, at any time during the minority of such person if his interest so long continues, apply those accumulations, or any part thereof, as if they were income arising in the then current year.
