COMMONWEALTH PLACES (MIRROR TAXES ADMINISTRATION) ACT 1998
- LONG TITLE
An Act to provide for the administration and operation of State taxing laws
that are applied as Commonwealth laws in relation to Commonwealth places; and
for related purposes.
Section 1 Name of Act
This Act is the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes Administration) Act 1998.
Section 2 Commencement
     (1) This Act commences on a day or days to be appointed by
     proclamation, except as provided by subsection (2).
     (2) When an arrangement has been made with the Commonwealth under
     section 5, section 7 is deemed to have come into operation on 6
     October 1997.
     Note : The operation of this Act and the Commonwealth Act will depend
     on the making of an arrangement under section 5 of this Act and
     section 9 of the Commonwealth Act. As soon as the arrangement is
     made, the State taxing laws are taken to have always applied in
     relation to Commonwealth places in the State, but not so as to impose
     any liability for tax for things that happened before 6 October 1997.

     "in relation to", when used in relation to a Commonwealth place or a
     place that was a Commonwealth place, means in, or in relation to, the

Section 5 Arrangements with Commonwealth
     (1) The Governor may make an arrangement with the Governor-General of
     the Commonwealth in relation to the exercise or performance of a
     power, duty or function (not being a power, duty or function
     involving the exercise of judicial power) by a State authority under
     an applied law.
     (2) The Governor may arrange with the Governor-General for the

Section 7 Modified operation of State taxing laws
     (1) If, in relation to a State taxing law, there is a corresponding
     applied law, the State taxing law is to be read and construed with
     any modifications that are necessary or convenient:
          (a) for the purpose of enabling the effective operation of
          the State taxing law in conjunction with the corresponding
          applied law, or
          (b) for the purpose of enabling the State taxing law to
          operate so that a taxpayer has a combined liability under:
               (i) the State taxing law, and
               (ii) the corresponding applied law,
          that is as nearly as possible the same as the taxpayer's
          liability would be under the State taxing law alone if the
          Commonwealth places in the State were not Commonwealth
          places.
     (2) Regulations may prescribe particular modifications that are to
     have effect under subsection (1).
     (3) Modifications prescribed under subsection (2):
          (a) may be expressed to take effect from a day that is
          earlier than the day on which the regulations are published
          in the Gazette (but not earlier than 6 October 1997), and
          (b) may deal with the circumstances in which the
          modifications apply, and with matters of a transitional or
          savings nature.
Section 8 Continuation of proceedings if place found not to be a Commonwealth place
If:
     (a) proceedings have been commenced in a court under a law as an
     applied law, and
     (b) the court is satisfied that the State taxing law that corresponds
     to that law is not excluded by section 52 (i) of the Commonwealth
     Constitution,
then the proceedings must be continued as though they had been commenced under
the State taxing law.
Section 9 Objection not allowable on ground of duplicate proceedings
In any proceedings under a State taxing law, an objection must not be allowed
merely on the ground that proceedings have been commenced, or are pending,
under a corresponding applied law.
Section 10 Proceedings on certain appeals
     (1) This section applies to an appeal from a judgment, decree, order
     or sentence of a court in proceedings under a law as an applied law.
     (2) If the court is satisfied that the State taxing law that
     corresponds to that law is not excluded by section 52 (i) of the
     Commonwealth Constitution, then the court must deal with the appeal
     as though:
          (a) the proceedings in relation to which the appeal was
          brought had been brought under the State taxing law, and
          (b) the judgment, decree, order or sentence had been given
          or made in proceedings brought under the State taxing law.
Section 11 Certificates about ownership of land
     (1) In proceedings under a State taxing law (or purporting to be
     under a State taxing law) in which any question arises as to whether
     a place is a Commonwealth place, a certificate in writing given by an
     authorised person about any of the following matters relating to land
     is evidence of the matters stated in the certificate:
          (a) the ownership of the land, or of an estate or interest
          in the land, on a date or during a period specified in the
          certificate,
          (b) the existence and ownership of a right in respect of
          the land, on a date or during a period specified in the
          certificate.
     (2) A document that purports to be a certificate referred to in
     subsection (1) is to be regarded as being such a certificate, and to
     have been duly given, unless the contrary is proved.
     (3) In this section:
     "authorised person" has the same meaning as it has in section 16 of
     the Commonwealth Act.
Section 12 Validation of things purportedly done under an applied law
If:
     (a) something purports to have been done under a law as an applied
     law, and
     (b) the State taxing law that corresponds to that law is not excluded
     by section 52 (i) of the Commonwealth Constitution,

law.

          expressly that it was intended to apply in relation to that
          place from that time.
