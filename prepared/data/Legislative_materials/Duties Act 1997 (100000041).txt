               (i) an agreement for the sale or transfer of

               (v) a vesting of dutiable property by or as a

               (vi) the enlargement of a term in land into a fee
               simple under section 134 of the Conveyancing Act
               1919,
               (vii) a vesting of land in New South Wales by, or
               expressly authorised by, statute law of this or

               other than an excluded transaction.
          Note : There are other provisions in this Act that deem
          certain transactions to be a transfer of dutiable property
          under this Chapter, for example--
               (a) section 9A, which provides for certain
               circumstances in which a transfer of a
               partnership interest is taken to occur, and
               (b) section 9B, which provides for certain
               circumstances in which a transfer of an option to
               purchase land is taken to occur, and
               (c) section 9C, which provides for circumstances
               in which a novation of an agreement for the lease
               of land in New South Wales is taken to be a
               transfer of dutiable property, and
               (d) Part 2 of Chapter 3, which treats a transfer
               or assignment of an option to purchase dutiable
               property as a transfer of the dutiable property
               in certain circumstances.
     (2) Such a transfer or transaction is a
     "dutiable transaction" for the purposes of this Act.
     (2A) Despite subsection (1)(b)(ix), an excluded transaction that
     results in a change in beneficial ownership of dutiable property is a
     dutiable transaction if it is part of a scheme or arrangement that,
     in the Chief Commissioner's opinion, was made with a collateral
     purpose of reducing the duty otherwise chargeable under this Chapter.
     (3) In this Chapter--

     "beneficial ownership" includes ownership of dutiable property by a

     "declaration of trust" means any declaration (other than by a will or
     testamentary instrument) that any identified property vested or to be
     vested in the person making the declaration is or is to be held in
     trust for the person or persons, or the purpose or purposes,
     mentioned in the declaration although the beneficial owner of the
     property, or the person entitled to appoint the property, may not
     have joined in or assented to the declaration.

     "excluded transaction" means the following--
          (a) the purchase, gift, allotment or issue of a unit in a
          unit trust scheme,
          (b) the cancellation, redemption or surrender of a unit in
          a unit trust scheme,
          (c) the abrogation or alteration of a right relating to a
          unit in a unit trust scheme,
          (d) the payment of an account owing for a unit in a unit
          trust scheme,
          (e) the grant, renewal or variation of a lease for no
          consideration,
          (f) the grant of an easement for no consideration,

          (i) a change in a trustee's right of indemnity,
          (j) the creation of an interest in dutiable property by
          statute,
          (k) a transaction of a kind prescribed by the regulations,
          (l) a combination of the transactions referred to in
          paragraphs (a)-(k).

     "lease" means a lease of land in New South Wales or an agreement for
     a lease of land in New South Wales.

     "premium", in respect of a lease entered into pursuant to an option,
     includes an amount paid or payable for the grant of the option.

     "transfer" includes an assignment, an exchange and a buy-back of
     shares in accordance with Division 2 of Part 2J.1 of the Corporations
     Act 2001 of the Commonwealth.

8AA Imposition of duty on acknowledgment of trust
     (1) This Chapter also charges duty on the making of a statement that-
     -
          (a) purports to be a declaration of trust over dutiable
          property, but
          (b) merely has the effect of acknowledging that identified
          property vested, or to be vested, in the person making the
          statement is already held, or to be held, in trust for a
          person or purpose mentioned in the statement.
     (2) For the purpose of charging the duty--
          (a) the making of the statement is taken to be a
          declaration of trust over dutiable property and,
          accordingly, is a dutiable transaction, and
          (b) the property vested, or to be vested, in the person
          making the statement is taken to be the property
          transferred, and
          (c) the person making the statement is taken to be the
          transferee, and
          (d) the transfer is taken to occur when the statement is
          made.

8A Vesting of land in New South Wales by statute law
     (1) Without limiting section 8 (1) (b) (vii), land in New South Wales
     is vested under statute law if the law vests the land in an entity
     that the law states is the successor in law of, continuation of or
     same entity as, the entity in which the land was previously vested.
     (2) However, land in New South Wales is not vested under statute law

     (3) The merger of a corporation (
     "company A") with and into another corporation (

     South Wales of company A in company B by statute law.
     (4) A merger of corporations (the
     "merging corporations") in circumstances where another corporation (
     "company C") results as a consequence of the merger is taken to be a
     vesting of the land in New South Wales of the merging corporations in
     company C by statute law.
     (5) A merger of corporations (the
     "merging corporations") with and into each other in circumstances
     where each of the merging corporations continues in existence is
     taken to be a vesting in the merging corporations, jointly, of 50%
     (in value) of the land in New South Wales of the merging corporations
     by statute law.
     (6) A division of a corporation (the
     "dividing corporation") in circumstances where the dividing
     corporation does not continue in existence and 2 or more other
     corporations (the
     "new corporations") result as a consequence of the division is taken
     to be a vesting in each new corporation by statute law of the land in
     New South Wales of the dividing corporation that is held by the new
     corporation as a result of the division.
     (7) A division of a corporation (the
     "dividing corporation") in circumstances where the dividing
     corporation continues in existence and 1 or more other corporations
     (the
     "new corporations") result as a consequence of the division is taken
     to be a vesting in each new corporation by statute law of the land in
     New South Wales of the dividing corporation that is held by the new

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 9A
Transfer of partnership interest occurring on change in partnership
arrangements
 
 
9A Transfer of partnership interest occurring on change in partnership
arrangements
     (1) A transfer of a partnership interest is taken to occur when a
     change in partnership arrangements occurs.
     (2) A change in partnership arrangements occurs if--
          (a) a partner in an existing partnership retires so that a
          new partnership is formed (with or without the admission of
          new partners), or
          (b) a new partner is admitted to an existing partnership so
          that a new partnership is formed.
     (3) A new partnership is formed when a partner in an existing
     partnership retires, unless the partnership is wound up on that
     retirement (sometimes referred to as a general dissolution of the
     partnership).
     (4) A new partnership is formed whenever a new partner is admitted to
     an existing partnership.
     (5) For the purposes of this Act--
          (a) if a change in partnership arrangements occurs because
          of the retirement of a partner in an existing partnership,
          the retiring partner's partnership interest is taken to be
          transferred to the partners in the new partnership (
          "a retirement transfer"), and
          (b) if a change in partnership arrangements occurs because
          of the admission of a new partner to an existing
          partnership, the new partner's partnership interest is
          taken to be transferred to the partners in the new
          partnership (
          "an admission transfer").
     (6) If a change in partnership arrangements results in both one or
     more retirement transfers and one or more admission transfers, duty
     is chargeable only on--
          (a) the retirement transfer or retirement transfers, if the
          dutiable value of the retirement transfer or retirement
          transfers exceeds the dutiable value of the admission
          transfer or admission transfers, or
          (b) the admission transfer or admission transfers, if the
          dutiable value of the admission transfer or admission
          transfers exceeds the dutiable value of the retirement
          transfer or retirement transfers.
     (7) This section does not affect liability for duty on a transfer of
     a partnership interest that occurs otherwise than because of a change
     in partnership arrangements.
          Note : For example, a transfer of a partnership interest
          from one partner to another partner in an existing
          partnership will also be dutiable under this Chapter.
     (7A) To avoid doubt, a transfer of a partnership interest that is
     taken to occur under this section is a transfer of dutiable property
     and a reference in this Act to a transfer of dutiable property or a
     dutiable transaction includes a reference to such a transfer.
     (8) In this section,
     "retirement" of a partner includes retirement as a consequence of the
     death of a partner.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 9B

          (b) another person is nominated as purchaser or transferee
          of the land the subject of the option on or before the
          exercise of the option, or
          (c) the option holder agrees to a novation of the option,
          or otherwise relinquishes rights under the option, so that
          another person obtains a right to exercise the option or to
          purchase the land.
     (2) For the purposes of this Act, in a case referred to in subsection
     (1) (a) or (b)--
          (a) the option is taken to be transferred when the
          nomination is made (and a reference in this Act to the time
          at which a transfer occurs includes a reference to such a
          time), and
          (b) the person nominated is taken to be the transferee of
          the option (and a reference in this Act to a transferee
          includes a reference to such a person).
     (3) For the purposes of this Act, in a case referred to in subsection
     (1) (c)--
          (a) the option is taken to be transferred when the option
          holder agrees to the novation or otherwise relinquishes
          rights under the option (and a reference in this Act to the
          time at which a transfer occurs includes a reference to
          such a time), and
          (b) the person who obtains a right to exercise the option

          respect of a transfer of dutiable property that is made in
          partial conformity with an agreement for the sale or

          been paid and declares the same trusts as were declared
          under the superseded declaration of trust, and
          (b) the beneficiary under the declaration of trust is the
          same as under the superseded declaration of trust, and
          (c) the dutiable property subject to the declaration of
          trust--
               (i) is wholly or substantially the same as the
               property that was the subject of the superseded
               declaration of trust at the time of the
               declaration of the superseded declaration of
               trust, or
               (ii) represents the proceeds of re-investment of
               property that was the subject of the superseded

               declaration of the superseded declaration of
               trust, or
               (iii) is property to which both subparagraphs (i)
               and (ii) apply.
     (7) A dutiable transaction in respect of marketable securities that
     confer a land use entitlement is taken to be a dutiable transaction
     in respect of the land use entitlement only. If duty has been paid on
     the dutiable transaction in accordance with a law of another
     Australian jurisdiction, the duty charged by this Chapter on the
     dutiable transaction is to be reduced by the amount of the duty so
     paid.
     (8) Despite subsection (1), if a single dutiable transaction is
     effected by more than one electronic registry instrument it is
     sufficient that one of those instruments is duly stamped with the
     duty chargeable on the dutiable transaction.

     has made improvements to the land, the unencumbered value of the land
     is to be determined as if those improvements had not been made.
     (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to improvements made to the land
     for or on behalf of the transferee by the transferor.

24 Interests, agreements and arrangements that reduce the dutiable value
     (1) In determining the dutiable value of dutiable property under this
     Part, any interest, agreement or arrangement (other than an
     encumbrance) granted or made in respect of the dutiable property that
     has the effect of reducing the dutiable value is to be disregarded,
     subject to subsection (2).
     (2) An interest, agreement or arrangement is not to be disregarded if
     the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that it was not granted or made
     as a part of an arrangement or scheme with a collateral purpose of
     reducing the duty otherwise payable on the dutiable transaction.
     (3) In considering whether or not he or she is satisfied for the
     purposes of subsection (2), the Chief Commissioner may have regard
     to--

          before the dutiable transaction, and
          (b) whether the interest, agreement or arrangement has been

          arrangement other than to reduce duty, and
          (d) any other matters the Chief Commissioner considers
          relevant.

25 Aggregation of dutiable transactions
     (1) Dutiable transactions relating to separate items of dutiable
     property, or separate parts of, or interests in, dutiable property
     are to be aggregated and treated as a single dutiable transaction if-
     -
          (ab) the transferor is the same or the transferors are
          associated persons, and
          (b) the transferee is the same or the transferees are
          associated persons, and
          (c) the dutiable transactions together form, evidence, give
          effect to or arise from what is, substantially, one
          arrangement relating to all of the items or parts of, or
          interests in, the dutiable property.
          Note :
          "Associated person" is defined in the Dictionary.
     (2) Dutiable transactions are not to be aggregated under this section
     if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that--
          (a) the dutiable property to which the transactions relate
          are comprised of separate allotments of vacant land, and
          (b) the transferee is a person authorised to contract to do
          residential building work under the Home Building Act 1989,
          and
          (c) the transferee intends to construct residential
          premises on the allotments for the purposes of sale to the
          public.
     (3) The dutiable value of aggregated dutiable property is the sum of
     the dutiable values of the items or parts of, or the interests in,
     the dutiable property as at the time at which each dutiable
     transaction occurs.
     (4) The amount of duty payable in accordance with this section is to
     be reduced by the amount of any ad valorem duty under this Chapter
     paid on a prior dutiable transaction that is, or prior dutiable
     transactions that are, aggregated in accordance with this section.
     (4A) The amount of duty payable on dutiable transactions aggregated
     in accordance with this section is to be calculated at the rate
     applicable under this Chapter at the time at which the earliest of
     the aggregated dutiable transactions occur.
     (5) Duty may be apportioned to the instruments effecting or
     evidencing the dutiable transactions, or may be charged in accordance
     with section 18 (1), as determined by the Chief Commissioner.
     (6) A transferee to whom this section applies must disclose to the
     Chief Commissioner, in writing, at or before the time at which an
     instrument or statement relating to the dutiable transactions is
     lodged for stamping, details known to the transferee of--
          (a) all of the items or parts of, or interests in, the
          dutiable property included or to be included in the
          arrangement referred to in subsection (1), and
          (b) the consideration for each item or part of, or interest
          in, that dutiable property.
          Maximum penalty (subsection (6)): 100 penalty units.
          Note : An offence against subsection (6) committed by a
          corporation is an executive liability offence attracting

          in the management of the corporation--see section 121 of
          the Taxation Administration Act 1996.
     (7) The reference in this section to dutiable property does not
     include a reference to marketable securities.
     (8) In this section--

     "vacant land" includes land that the Chief Commissioner considers is

Apportionment--dutiable property and other property
 
 
27 Apportionment--dutiable property and other property
     (1) If a dutiable transaction relates to dutiable property and
     property that is not dutiable property, it is chargeable with duty
     under this Chapter only to the extent that it relates to dutiable
     property.
     (2) If a dutiable transaction relates to different types of dutiable
     property for which different rates of duty are chargeable under this
     Chapter, the dutiable transaction is chargeable with duty under this
     Chapter as if a separate dutiable transaction had occurred in
     relation to each such type of dutiable property.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 28
Apportionment--business assets in this and other jurisdictions
 
 
28 Apportionment--business assets in this and other jurisdictions
     (1) Business assets to which this section applies This section
     applies to a business asset referred to in section 11 (1) (g), being-
     -
          (a) the goodwill of a business, if the business has also
          supplied goods outside New South Wales, or provided
          services outside New South Wales, to a customer of the
          business during the previous 12 months, or
          (b) intellectual property that has also been used or
          exploited in one or more other Australian jurisdictions
          during the previous 12 months, or
          (c) a statutory licence or permission under a Commonwealth
          law if the rights under the licence or permission have been
          exercised during the previous 12 months in respect of one
          or more other Australian jurisdictions.
     (2) How is the dutiable value of a business asset determined? The
     dutiable value (
     "DV") of a business asset to which this section applies is to be
     determined in accordance with the following formula--

          "A" is the unencumbered value of the business asset, or so
          much of the consideration for the dutiable transaction as
          relates to the business asset, whichever is the greater,
          and

          "X" is the gross amount (expressed in Australian dollars)
          of goods supplied, and services provided, in New South
          Wales by the business to customers of the business during
          the last 3 completed financial years preceding the dutiable
          transaction, and

          "Y" is the gross amount (expressed in Australian dollars)
          of goods supplied, and services provided, in and outside
          New South Wales by the business to customers of the
          business during the last 3 completed financial years
          preceding the dutiable transaction.
     (3) Subsection (2) applies to intellectual property together with
     goodwill as if the intellectual property and goodwill comprise a
     single business asset.
     (4) If an apportionment cannot be made under subsection (2), the
     Chief Commissioner may make an apportionment on such basis as the
     Chief Commissioner considers appropriate in the circumstances.
     (5) In this section, a reference to a service provided to a customer
     includes a reference to anything done for a customer pursuant to a
     contractual obligation.
     (6) This section applies only to dutiable transactions that occur
     before 1 July 2016 (the date on which duty on transfers of business
     assets is abolished).
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 29
Partnership interests
 
 
29 Partnership interests
     (1) The dutiable value of a partnership interest (
     "DV") is to be determined in accordance with the following formula--

          "A" is the value of the partnership interest, or so much of
          the consideration for the dutiable transaction as relates
          to the partnership interest, whichever is the greater, and

          "X" is the unencumbered value of all dutiable property of
          the partnership, and

          "Y" is the unencumbered value of all assets of the
          partnership.
     (2) For the purposes of this section and despite subsection (1), the
     unencumbered value of dutiable property that is a business asset to
     which section 28 applies is the dutiable value of the business asset
     determined in accordance with section 28.
     (3) If the property of a partnership includes a land-related asset
     and an interest in the land-related asset is transferred as a result
     of the transfer of the partnership interest, the dutiable value of
     the partnership interest is to be reduced by the dutiable value of
     the interest in the land-related asset that is transferred, but only
     if ad valorem duty under this Chapter has been paid or is payable on
     the transfer of the interest in the land-related asset.
          Note : For example, 3 partners jointly hold land valued at
          $9 million and other non-dutiable property valued at $3
          million. The partnership has liabilities of $6 million. One
          partner retires, and is paid $2 million for his or her
          partnership interest. The retiring partner transfers a one-
          third interest in the land to the remaining partners. Duty
          is payable at an ad valorem rate on the transfer of the
          one-third interest in the land. The transfer of the
          interest in land has a dutiable value of $3 million. Under
          this section, the partnership interest has a dutiable value
          of $1.5 million (DV = $2M × $9M/$12M). As the dutiable
          value of the interest in land transferred exceeds the
          dutiable value of the partnership interest transferred, the
          minimum duty would be payable on the transfer of the
          partnership interest.
     (3A) The minimum duty chargeable in respect of a transfer of a
     partnership interest to which subsection (3) applies is $100.
     (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), each of the following items
     of dutiable property is a
     "land-related asset" --
          (a) land in New South Wales,
          (b) transferable floor space,
          (c) a land use entitlement,
          (d) an interest in an item of dutiable property referred to
          in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 30
Partitions
 
 
30 Partitions
     (1) What is a partition? For the purposes of this section, a
     partition occurs when dutiable property comprised of land in New
     South Wales that is held by persons jointly (as joint tenants or
     tenants in common) is transferred or agreed to be transferred to one
     or more of those persons.
     (2) Single dutiable transaction For the purposes of this section and
     sections 16, 18 and 104X, a partition is taken to be a single
     dutiable transaction.
     (3) Dutiable value The dutiable value of a partition is the greater
     of--
          (a) the sum of the amounts by which the unencumbered value
          of the dutiable property transferred, or agreed to be
          transferred, to a person by the partition exceeds the
          unencumbered value of the interest held by the person in
          the dutiable property transferred, or agreed to be
          transferred, to each person by the partition immediately
          before the partition, and
          (b) the sum of any consideration for the partition paid by
          any of the parties.
     (4) Minimum duty The minimum duty chargeable on a transaction that
     effects a partition is $100.
     (5) Who is liable to pay the duty? Duty charged by this section is
     payable by the persons making the partition or any one or more of
     them.
     (6) Anti-avoidance criteria This section does not apply in respect of
     a partition if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the partition
     is part of a scheme to avoid duty on an exchange of land that was not
     jointly held by the parties before the scheme was entered into.

Effect of alteration in purchase price
 
 
31 Effect of alteration in purchase price
     (1) If after an agreement for the sale or transfer of dutiable
     property is entered into and before the property is transferred--
          (a) the consideration under the agreement is reduced and
          the reduced consideration is not less than the unencumbered
          value of the dutiable property when the consideration was
          reduced, or
          (b) the consideration under the agreement is reduced
          because the parties have agreed not to transfer some of the
          dutiable property previously agreed to be transferred and
          the reduced consideration is not less than the unencumbered
          value of the dutiable property that remained to be
          transferred when the consideration was reduced, or
          (c) the consideration under the agreement is increased and
          the dutiable value when the consideration was increased is
          greater than the dutiable value when the agreement was
          entered into,
     the Chief Commissioner must assess or reassess the liability to duty
     of the agreement in accordance with the change in the consideration.
     (2) The liability to pay additional duty arising from an increase in
     the consideration occurs on the date the consideration is agreed to
     be increased.
     (3) The amount of duty assessed or reassessed in accordance with this
     section must be calculated at the rate applicable under this chapter
     when the agreement for the sale or transfer was first executed.

     (1) The rate of duty chargeable on a dutiable transaction in respect
     of residential land that has a dutiable value exceeding $3,040,000 is
     the premium base amount plus $7 for every $100, or part, by which the

          (a) there are no other members of the superannuation fund
          (besides the member or members transferring or agreeing to
          transfer the property) or the dutiable property is
          segregated from other fund property, and
          (b) the property is to be used solely for the purpose of
          providing a retirement benefit to the member or members
          transferring or agreeing to transfer the property, and

     the will or arising on intestacy.
     (2A) A transmission application made by a beneficiary under a will,
     with the consent of the legal personal representative of a deceased
     person, is taken, for the purposes of this section, to be a transfer
     of dutiable property by the legal personal representative to the
     beneficiary.
     (3) Section 25 does not apply to a dutiable transaction to which
     subsection (2) applies.

          agreement for transfer or sale of the dutiable property,
          and
          (b) the duty chargeable in respect of the agreement has
          been paid.
     (2) A transfer is made in partial conformity with an agreement for
     transfer or sale if the transfer conforms with the agreement, apart
     from the fact that a share in the dutiable property transferred to
     one or more of the transferees under the transfer exceeds the share
     agreed to be transferred to the relevant transferee under the
     agreement.
     (3) Duty is to be charged only on the excess proportion of the
     dutiable value of the dutiable property transferred.
     (4) The
     "excess proportion" is the proportion, or the total of the
     proportions, by which the share or shares in the dutiable property
     transferred to each transferee exceed the share or shares in the
     dutiable property (if any) agreed to be transferred to each
     transferee.
     (5) If a share in dutiable property is transferred to a transferee
     who was not a transferee under the agreement for transfer or sale,
     this section applies as if the share agreed to be transferred to that
     transferee is nil.
     (6) This section does not apply if section 18 (3) applies in respect
     of the transfer.
     Example 1: An agreement provides for the transfer of dutiable
     property to 3 purchasers as equal tenants in common. Accordingly, the
     share of the dutiable property agreed to be transferred to each
     purchaser is one-third each. When the property is transferred, it is
     transferred to only 2 of the purchasers so that each purchaser
     acquires a one-half share. The shares transferred exceed the shares
     agreed to be transferred. That is, each purchaser has acquired a one-
     half share in the property instead of a one-third share. The excess
     proportion is the total of the proportions by which the shares
     transferred to the transferees exceed the shares agreed to be
     transferred. The total of (one-half minus one-third) and (one-half
     minus one-third) is one-third. Duty is charged on one-third of the
     dutiable value of the property transferred.
     Example 2: An agreement provides for the transfer of dutiable
     property to 2 purchasers as equal tenants in common. Accordingly, the
     share of the dutiable property agreed to be transferred to each
     purchaser is one-half each. When the property is transferred, it is
     transferred to 3 transferees so that each transferee acquires a one-
     third share. The 2 one-third shares transferred to the original
     purchasers under the agreement do not exceed the shares agreed to be
     transferred. The excess proportion is the proportion by which the
     share transferred to the new transferee (one-third) exceeds the share
     agreed to be transferred (nil). Duty is charged on one-third of the
     dutiable value of the property transferred.

     capacity as trustee or executor.
     (7) The fact that a purchaser or transferee under an agreement or
     transfer is not a first home owner does not prevent the agreement or
     transfer from being eligible under the scheme if--
          (a) one or more of the purchasers or transferees under the
          agreement or transfer is a first home owner, and
          (b) the total ownership share in the property to which the
          application relates that is being acquired by purchasers or
          transferees who are not first home owners does not exceed
          5%.
          Note : A purchaser or transferee is not considered to be a
          first home owner unless both the purchaser or transferee,
          and his or her spouse (if any), have not owned residential
          property before. See subsection (2).
     (8) For the purposes of this section, a person who is, or has at any
     time been, the holder of a leasehold interest granted by the
     Commonwealth in residential property in the Australian Capital
     Territory is taken to own or have owned that residential property.

     Chief Commissioner is satisfied that--
          (a) the home to which the agreement or transfer relates
          will be occupied by the purchaser or transferee as his or

     (2) If the agreement or transfer is entered into, or occurs, under an
     approved shared equity scheme, it does not matter that the approved
     equity partners are not eligible under the scheme, as long as the

     (2) Any such separate agreement or transfer is taken to be an
     agreement or transfer for the whole of the property if it is for all
     of the land to be used or occupied for the purposes of the exclusive
     occupancy.
     (3) In this Part, a reference to the dutiable property the subject of
     the agreement or transfer is a reference to that part of the land
     that is to be used or occupied for the purposes of the exclusive
     occupancy.
     (4) For the purposes of this section, a home that is being acquired
     or built under a multiple occupancy contract is an

Special concession for shared equity arrangements
 
 
78B Special concession for shared equity arrangements
     (1) If there is more than one purchaser or transferee under an
     agreement or transfer, and one or more of them is a first home owner,
     but the agreement or transfer is not eligible under the scheme
     because one or more of the other purchasers or transferees is not
     eligible under the scheme, the agreement or transfer may still be
     eligible for a duty concession under the scheme (a
     "shared equity concession").
     (2) In order to be eligible for a shared equity concession--
          (a) the purchasers or transferees who are first home owners
          must acquire not less than a 50% share in the ownership of
          the property, and
          (b) the agreement or transfer must be an agreement or
          transfer that would be eligible under the scheme if the
          first home owners were the sole purchasers or transferees
          under the agreement or transfer.
     (3) If an application concerning an agreement or transfer that is
     eligible under the scheme for a shared equity concession is approved,
     duty is chargeable as follows--

          "D" is the duty chargeable.

          "R" is the duty that would be chargeable on the dutiable
          value of the property if this Division did not apply in
          respect of the agreement or transfer.

          "E" is the ownership share in the property of the first
          home owner or owners, expressed as a percentage.

          "C" is the duty (if any) that would be chargeable under
          section 78A or 78AA on the agreement or transfer if that
          section applied in respect of the agreement or transfer.
     (4) Despite anything to the contrary in this section, an agreement or
     transfer under which one or more of the purchasers or transferees is
     a company is not eligible under the scheme for a shared equity
     concession if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the
     application relating to that agreement or transfer should not be
     approved for any good reason.
     (5) To avoid doubt, a reference in this Division (except sections 78A
     and 78AA) to an application that has been approved under the scheme
     includes an application that has been approved under the scheme
     because of eligibility for a shared equity concession.
     (6) This section does not apply to an agreement or transfer that is
     entered into, or occurs, under an approved shared equity scheme.
          Note : An agreement or transfer that is entered into, or
          occurs, under an approved shared equity scheme is eligible
          under the scheme, even though not all the purchasers or
          transferees are eligible (see section 73A).

     respect of an agreement or transfer that is initially approved under
     the scheme if the Chief Commissioner forms the opinion that the
     agreement or transfer is not eligible under the scheme (because of

          principally residential purposes.
     (2) Land does not cease to be regarded as land on which there is one
     single dwelling, or one flat, merely because the land is also used or
     is capable of being used for the purpose of one other residential

               (ii) is a parcel of vacant land, or land on which
               there is a building under construction, and the
               married couple or de facto partners intend to use
               the residential land as the site of a dwelling to
               be used as their principal place of residence,
               and

     if it is partly held by another person who is not a part of the
     married couple or one of the de facto partners.

104C Concession--transfer of land used as principal place of residence and for
other purposes
     (1) If a transfer or agreement for transfer of residential land would
     be exempt from duty under section 104B, but for the fact that the
     land has been used or is intended to be used for a purpose other than
     a residential purpose, the duty chargeable on the transfer or
     agreement is to be calculated after reducing the dutiable value of
     the land by the residential apportionment factor.
     (2) The residential apportionment factor is calculated by subtracting
     the non-residential apportionment factor from 1.
     (3) The non-residential apportionment factor is--
          (a) if the land is mixed development land or mixed use land
          and there is an apportionment factor entered in the
          Register of Land Values in respect of the land value of the
          land under Division 5 or 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of
          Land Act 1916 --that apportionment factor, or
          (b) if paragraph (a) is not applicable--such other
          apportionment factor as the Chief Commissioner considers
          fair and reasonable to reflect the use of the land for non-
          residential purposes, subject to subsections (4) and (5).
     (4) If there is no apportionment factor entered in the Register of
     Land Values in respect of the land value of the land, and the land is
     mixed development land or mixed use land, the Chief Commissioner may
     request the Valuer-General to determine the apportionment factor in
     respect of the land concerned.
     (5) If a request is made under subsection (4)--
          (a) the Valuer-General must determine the apportionment
          factor concerned and enter it in the Register of Land
          Values under the Valuation of Land Act 1916, and
          (b) that apportionment factor is to be applied as the non-
          residential apportionment factor in respect of the
          residential land.
          Note : Divisions 5 and 5A of Part 1B of the Valuation of
          Land Act 1916 allow objections to be made against the
          amount of the apportionment factor.
     (6) Duty on the transfer or agreement is to be charged at the general
     rate provided for by section 32. Sections 32A-32C do not apply.
     (7) In this section--

     "mixed development land" has the same meaning as in Division 5 of
     Part 1B of the Valuation of Land Act 1916.

     "mixed use land" has the same meaning as in Division 5A of Part 1B of
     the Valuation of Land Act 1916.

Section 104J
Meanings of "foreign person" and "foreign trustee"
 
 
104J Meanings of "foreign person" and "foreign trustee"
     (1) In this Chapter--

     "foreign person" means a person who is a foreign person within the
     meaning of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 of the
     Commonwealth, as modified by this section.

     "foreign trustee" means a person who is a foreign person because of
     the person's capacity as the trustee of a trust.
     (2) The definition of
     "foreign person" in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975
     of the Commonwealth is modified as follows--
          (a) an Australian citizen is taken to be ordinarily
          resident in Australia, whether or not the person is
          ordinarily resident in Australia under that definition,
          (b) a New Zealand citizen who holds a special category
          visa, within the meaning of section 32 of the Migration Act
          1958 of the Commonwealth, at any particular time is taken
          at that time to be an individual whose continued presence
          in Australia is not subject to any limitation as to time
          imposed by law.
          Note : Section 5 of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers
          Act 1975 of the Commonwealth provides that an individual
          who is not an Australian citizen is ordinarily resident in
          Australia at a particular time (and is therefore not a
          foreign person) if and only if--
               (a) the individual has actually been in Australia
               during 200 or more days in the period of 12
               months immediately preceding that time, and
               (b) at that time--
                    (i) the individual is in Australia and
                    the individual's continued presence in
                    Australia is not subject to any
                    limitation as to time imposed by law,
                    or
                    (ii) the individual is not in Australia
                    but, immediately before the
                    individual's most recent departure from
                    Australia, the individual's continued
                    presence in Australia was not subject
                    to any limitation as to time imposed by
                    law.
     (3) For the purposes of charging surcharge purchaser duty on a
     surcharge duty transaction, a person is taken to be a foreign person
     if the person is a foreign person when a liability for duty charged
     by Chapter 2 on the transaction arises (or would arise but for
     section 53A or a concession or exemption from duty under that
     Chapter).
          Note : See section 12.
     (4) When assessing whether a sub-fund of a CCIV is a foreign person
     for the purposes of this chapter, the Foreign Acquisitions and
     Takeovers Act 1975 of the Commonwealth must be read subject to
     section 5A.
     (5) To avoid doubt, subsection (4) also applies for the purposes of
     the definition of
     "foreign person" in the Land Tax Act 1956.

     foreign person from being a beneficiary of the trust.

          person (the
          "no foreign beneficiary requirement"),
          (b) the terms of the trust are not capable of amendment in
          a manner that would result in there being a potential
          beneficiary of the trust who is a foreign person (the

               Note : Under the transitional arrangements for
               this section in Schedule 1, the no amendment
               requirement does not apply to a trust that
               satisfies the no foreign beneficiary requirement
               immediately before the commencement of this
               section.
     (4) A person is a
     "potential beneficiary" of a discretionary trust if the exercise or
     failure to exercise a discretion under the terms of the trust can
     result in any property of the trust being distributed to or applied
     for the benefit of the person.
          Note : A potential beneficiary is not limited to persons
          named in the trust instrument and extends to the members of
          any class of persons to whom or for whose benefit trust
          property can be distributed or applied pursuant to the
          discretions of the trust.
     (5) For the removal of doubt, a person is not a potential beneficiary
     of a discretionary trust if the terms of the trust prevent any
     property of the trust from being distributed to or applied for the
     benefit of the person.
     (6) In this section,
     "property" includes money, and a reference to the distribution or
     application of property includes a reference to the payment of money.

               (vi) the enlargement of a term in residential
               land into a fee simple under section 134 of the
               Conveyancing Act 1919 where the person who
               acquires the estate in fee simple (or, if there

     "surcharge duty transaction" for the purposes of this Act.
          Note : The above listed transfers and transactions are all
          also dutiable transactions under Chapter 2. Generally

          person is liable to pay duty on those transactions under
          Chapter 2 and under this Chapter.

     the person were actually vested in the person when the declaration is
     made.
     (4) In this Chapter--

     "declaration of trust" and
     "premium" have the same meanings as in Chapter 2.

          expressions.

     "lease" or
     "lease of residential land" means a lease of residential land in New
     South Wales or an agreement for a lease of residential land in New
     South Wales.

     "transfer" includes an assignment and an exchange.
          Note : See also sections 104N and 104O in relation to

          transferred includes a reference to such property), and
          (b) the person specified opposite the surcharge duty
          transaction in Column 3 is taken to be the transferee of
          the residential-related property (and a reference in this
          Act to a transferee includes a reference to such a person),
          and

     (1) Sections 9A-9C apply, subject to this section and to any other
     necessary modifications, for the purpose of charging surcharge
     purchaser duty under this Chapter.
     (2) For that purpose--
          (a) a change in partnership arrangements that is of a kind
          referred to in section 9A is taken to be a transfer of a
          partnership interest (within the meaning of this Chapter)
          if the partnership has partnership property that is
          residential-related property, and
          (b) a transaction of a kind referred to in section 9B in
          respect of an option to purchase residential land in New
          South Wales is taken to be a transfer of an option to
          purchase residential land, and
          (c) a transaction of a kind referred to in section 9C that
          is a novation of an agreement for the lease of residential
          land in New South Wales is taken to be a transfer of
          residential-related property as if--
               (i) the lessee's interest in the agreement were
               residential-related property, and
               (ii) the novation of the agreement were a
               transfer of that residential-related property.
     (3) Surcharge purchaser duty is chargeable on any such transfer if
     any of the persons taken to be transferees by section 9A, 9B or 9C
     (as the case may be) are foreign persons.
     (4) To avoid doubt--
          (a) this section does not affect liability for surcharge
          purchaser duty on a transfer of a partnership interest that
          occurs otherwise than because of a change in partnership
          arrangements, and
          (b) a reference in this Act to a transfer of residential-
          related property includes a reference to a transaction
          taken to be a transfer by this section, and
          (c) a reference in this Act to a surcharge duty transaction
          includes a reference to a transaction chargeable with
          surcharge purchaser duty under this section, and
          (d) a reference in this Act to residential-related property
          includes, in relation to a transfer that is taken to occur

transactions
     (1) This section applies to a surcharge duty transaction that is--
          (a) a transfer, or an agreement for the sale or transfer,
          of residential-related property where the transferee is
          acquiring the residential-related property in a trustee
          capacity, or
          (b) a declaration of trust over residential-related
          property by a person who, because of the declaration, is a
          foreign trustee in respect of the trust.
     (2) The transferee is only liable to pay surcharge purchaser duty on
     any such surcharge duty transaction if the transferee is a foreign
     trustee in respect of the trust.
     (3) In applying the provisions of this Chapter to a surcharge duty
     transaction referred to in subsection (1) (a), the transferee is not
     to be treated as a foreign person unless the transferee is a foreign
     trustee.
          Note : For example, a trustee who is not a foreign trustee
          will not be liable for surcharge purchaser duty, even if
          the trustee is otherwise a foreign person.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 104T
Property purchased by apparent purchaser
 
 
104T Property purchased by apparent purchaser
     (1) This section applies to a transfer, or an agreement for the sale
     or transfer, of residential-related property if the Chief
     Commissioner is satisfied that the transferee is an apparent
     purchaser and that the money for the purchase has been or will be
     provided by the real purchaser.
     (2) In applying the provisions of this Chapter in relation to a
     transfer or agreement to which this section applies--
          (a) the apparent purchaser is taken to be acquiring the
          residential-related property in a trustee capacity, and
          (b) if any of the real purchasers are foreign persons, the
          apparent purchaser is taken to be a foreign trustee in
          respect of the trust.
     (3) Accordingly, section 104S (3) applies in relation to the apparent
     purchaser.
     (4) For the purposes of this section, money provided by a person
     other than the real purchaser is taken to have been provided by the
     real purchaser if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the money
     was provided as a loan and has been or will be repaid by the real
     purchaser.
     (5) This section applies whether or not there has been a change in
     the legal description of the residential-related property between the
     purchase of the property by the apparent purchaser and the transfer
     to the real purchaser.
          Note : For example, if the residential-related property is
          land, this section continues to apply if there is a change
          in the legal description of the residential-related
          property as a consequence of the subdivision of the land.

     duty is to be charged on the dutiable value of the residential-
     related property subject to the surcharge duty transaction at a rate
     of 9% of the dutiable value of the residential-related property.
     (2) If any of the transferees are not foreign persons, surcharge
     purchaser duty is to be charged only on the proportion of the
     dutiable value of the residential-related property that is the same
     as the proportion of the share or shares in that property transferred
     to foreign persons.
     (3) If the surcharge duty transaction consists of a partition and any
     of the transferees are not foreign persons, surcharge purchaser duty
     is to be charged only on the proportion of the dutiable value of the
     partition that is the same as the proportion of the share or shares
     in the residential land transferred, or agreed to be transferred, to
     foreign persons.

               persons.
     (4) Surcharge purchaser duty is not chargeable on a transfer to a
     trustee of residential-related property subject to a declaration of
     trust if surcharge purchaser duty has been paid on the declaration of
     trust in respect of the same residential-related property.
     (5) Surcharge purchaser duty is not chargeable on a transfer of

          factor concerned and enter it in the Register of Land
          Values under the Valuation of Land Act 1916, and

     from the unencumbered value of the residential-related property or
     the consideration for the transfer or agreement, whichever is the
     greater, the proportion of that amount that is the same as the
     proportion of any foreign transferee's beneficial interest in the

          "exempted transfer"),
          (e) if the revocation of an approval is backdated to extend
          to an exempted transfer, surcharge purchaser duty is
          payable and is to be assessed or reassessed as if the

          section 62 applies, or
          (d) the transaction is a transfer, or an agreement for the
          sale or transfer, of residential-related property and a

of residence
     (1) No surcharge purchaser duty is chargeable on a transfer, or an
     agreement for the sale or transfer, of residential-related property
     if each transferee under the transfer or agreement who would
     otherwise be liable to pay that duty is an exempt permanent resident.
     (2) A transferee under a transfer or agreement is an
     "exempt permanent resident" if--
          (a) the transferee is a permanent resident when a liability
          for duty charged by Chapter 2 on the transfer or agreement
          arises (or would arise but for a concession or exemption
          from duty under that Chapter), and
          (b) the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the transferee
          intends to use and occupy the residential land to which the
          residential-related property relates as a principal place
          of residence in accordance with the residence requirement.
     (3) If there is more than one transferee under the transfer or
     agreement who is a foreign person (a
     "foreign transferee") and the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that at
     least one, but not all, of those transferees is an exempt permanent
     resident--
          (a) surcharge purchaser duty is to be reduced in proportion
          to the share or shares in the residential-related property
          transferred to foreign transferees who are exempt permanent
          residents, and
          (b) none of those exempt permanent residents is liable to
          pay surcharge purchaser duty on the transfer or agreement.
     (4) The residential land must be used and occupied by the exempt
     permanent resident as his or her principal place of residence for a
     continuous period of at least 200 days within the first 12 months
     after the liability date. This requirement is referred to as
     "the residence requirement".
     (5) The
     "liability date" is the date on which liability to surcharge
     purchaser duty first arose in respect of the share in the
     residential-related property transferred, or agreed to be
     transferred, to the exempt permanent resident.
     (6) If the residence requirement is not complied with in relation to
     the residential land, the Chief Commissioner must assess or reassess
     the surcharge purchaser duty chargeable on the transfer or agreement
     as if the exemption under this section had never applied.
     (7) A reference in this section to the use and occupation of
     residential land as a principal place of residence in accordance with
     the residence requirement includes--
          (a) in the case of a land use entitlement, a reference to

          building to which the entitlement relates, as a principal
          place of residence in accordance with the residence
          requirement, and
          (b) in the case of a utility lot (within the meaning of the
          Strata Schemes Management Act 2015), a reference to the use
          of the utility lot in conjunction with a strata lot used
          and occupied as a principal place of residence in
          accordance with the residence requirement.

     dutiable property under Chapter 2 on certain transactions which are
     not "dutiable transactions" under Chapter 2.
     (2) This Chapter also charges duty on certain transactions involving
     foreign persons that are not "surcharge duty transactions" under

Definitions
 
 
106 Definitions
In this Part--

"assign" or
"assignment" includes transfer, and a reference to the assignment of a right
under a call option includes a reference to a transfer of the call option.

"call option" means a right to require a person to sell dutiable property that
is conferred by an agreement or arrangement (being an agreement or arrangement
that is not a dutiable transaction).

"put option" means a right to require a person to purchase dutiable property
that is conferred by an agreement or arrangement (being an agreement or
arrangement that is not a dutiable transaction).

"residential land" has the same meaning as in Chapter 2A.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 107
Assignment of rights under call option dutiable as transfer
 
 
107 Assignment of rights under call option dutiable as transfer
     (1) If a person (
     "A") who has a right under a call option to require another person (
     "B") to sell dutiable property assigns that right, so that the option
     is exercisable by a third person (
     "C"), duty under Chapter 2 is chargeable on that assignment as if the
     assignment were a transfer of the dutiable property concerned. The
     duty chargeable on that assignment is referred to in this Part as
     "call option assignment duty".
     (1A) Duty under Chapter 2A is also chargeable on the assignment if A
     is a foreign person and the dutiable property concerned is
     residential-related property. The duty chargeable on that assignment
     is additional to call option assignment duty and is referred to in
     this Part as
     "surcharge call option assignment duty".
     (2) For the purposes of this section--
          (a) if A enters into an agreement or arrangement under
          which A, for valuable consideration, relinquishes the right
          under a call option to require B to sell dutiable property
          and a call option to require B to sell the dutiable
          property is granted to a third person (
          "C"), A is to be treated as having assigned that right
          under the call option so that the option is exercisable by
          C, and
          (b) if, on or in connection with the exercise of a call
          option, A, for valuable consideration, enters into an
          agreement or arrangement under which A nominates a third
          person (
          "C") as the purchaser or transferee of dutiable property
          the subject of a call option, A is to be treated as having
          assigned the right under the call option to require B to
          sell the dutiable property so that the option is
          exercisable by C, and
          (c) if A enters into an agreement or arrangement under
          which A, for valuable consideration, relinquishes the right
          under a call option to require B to sell dutiable property
          and B agrees to sell the dutiable property to a third
          person (
          "C"), A is to be treated as having assigned that right
          under the call option so that the option is exercisable by
          C.
     (3) An assignment is chargeable with duty as a consequence of this
     Part only if the person who may be required under the call option to
     sell the dutiable property (that is, B) has a right under a put
     option to require A, an associated person of A or an assignee of A to
     purchase the dutiable property.
     (4) If the assignment is chargeable with call option assignment duty,
     Chapter 2 applies in respect of the assignment in the same way as it
     applies to other transfers of dutiable property, and a reference in
     this Act to a dutiable transaction includes such an assignment,
     subject to this Part.
     (4A) If the assignment is chargeable with surcharge call option
     assignment duty, Chapter 2A applies in respect of the assignment in
     the same way as it applies to other transfers of residential-related
     property, and a reference in this Act to a surcharge duty transaction
     includes such an assignment, subject to this Part.
     (5) For the purposes of Chapters 2 and 2A, the transfer of dutiable
     property (including dutiable property that is residential-related
     property) is taken to occur when the assignment is made.
     (6) This section applies regardless of when the call option or put
     option is exercisable.
     (7) An assignment of a right under a call option to purchase dutiable
     property, as referred to in subsection (1) or (2), is referred to in
     this Part as a
     "call option assignment".
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 108
Person liable to pay call option assignment duty
 
 
108 Person liable to pay call option assignment duty
     (1) The call option assignment duty chargeable on a call option
     assignment is payable by the person who assigns the right under the
     call option to require another person to sell dutiable property (
     "the option holder").
     (2) Accordingly, the option holder is taken, for the purpose of
     charging duty under Chapter 2, to be the transferee of the dutiable
     property.
     (3) The call option assignment duty payable by the option holder is
     additional to the duty (if any) payable under Chapter 2 by a
     transferee on the transfer of an option to purchase land in New South
     Wales.
     (4) However, the call option assignment duty payable by the option
     holder as a consequence of this Part is to be reduced by the amount
     of duty (if any) paid by the option holder under Chapter 2 on the
     transfer of the call option to the option holder.
     Note : The following is an example of how this Part operates--
     B grants A a call option that confers a right on A (or any assignee
     of A) to require B to sell land. A also grants B a put option that
     confers on B a right to require A (or any assignee of A) to purchase
     the land from B. A must pay duty on the dutiable value of the option,
     as determined under Chapter 2
     A then transfers the call option to C. Duty is payable as follows--
          (a) A (as the option holder) must pay call option
          assignment duty, as a consequence of this Part, as if the
          transfer of the option were a transfer of the land. Duty is
          payable on the dutiable value of the land (determined as
          provided for by this Part),
          (b) C (as the transferee of the option) must pay duty under
          Chapter 2 on the transfer of the option. Duty is payable on
          the dutiable value of the option (determined as provided
          for by Chapter 2).
     C then transfers the option to D. C (as the option holder) is
     required to pay call option assignment duty as if the option were a
     transfer of the land. However, in this case C will receive a credit
     for the duty paid by C on the transfer of the option to C. D (as the
     transferee of the option) is required to pay duty under Chapter 2 on
     the transfer.

Section 108A
Person liable to pay surcharge call option assignment duty
 
 
108A Person liable to pay surcharge call option assignment duty
     (1) Surcharge call option assignment duty on a call option assignment
     is payable by any foreign person who assigns the right under the call
     option to require another person to sell residential-related property
     (
     "the foreign option holder").
     (2) Accordingly, the foreign option holder is taken, for the purposes
     of charging duty under Chapter 2A, to be the transferee of the
     residential-related property.
     (3) The duty payable by the foreign option holder is additional to
     the duty (if any) payable under Chapter 2A by a transferee on the
     transfer of an option to purchase residential land in New South
     Wales.
     (4) However, the duty payable by the foreign option holder as a
     consequence of this Part is to be reduced by the amount of duty (if
     any) paid by the foreign option holder under Chapter 2A on the
     transfer of the call option to the foreign option holder.

that is dutiable property) that is subject to a call option assignment is taken
to be the greater of--
     (a) the sum of the consideration for the assignment of the right
     under the call option and the consideration payable in the event that
     the call option is exercised (being in either case the amount of
     monetary consideration or the value of non-monetary consideration),
     and
     (b) the unencumbered value of the dutiable property.

          to control not less than 50% of the maximum number of votes
          that might be cast at a general meeting of the first
          corporation), or
          (b) the corporations are wholly owned subsidiaries (within
          the meaning of paragraph (a)) of the same corporation.

     meaning of subsection (2A) (a)) of another corporation (the
     "parent corporation") holds shares, otherwise than as trustee, in a
     third corporation, then, for the purposes of determining whether the
     parent corporation and the third corporation are members of the same
     group of corporations, the shares held by the wholly owned subsidiary
     in the third corporation are taken also to be shares held by the
     parent corporation in the third corporation.
          Note : The effect of subsection (2B) is that the third
          corporation will be considered to be a wholly owned
          subsidiary of the parent corporation if the shareholdings
          of the parent corporation in the third corporation (if any)
          together with the shareholdings of any wholly owned
          subsidiary in the third corporation are sufficient to
          satisfy subsection (2A) (a).
     (3) In this section--

     "proprietor" of a business means--
          (a) in the case of a business carried on by a partnership,
          a partner, or
          (b) in the case of a business carried on by a company, a
          shareholder, or
          (c) in the case of a business carried on by a unit trust
          scheme, a unit holder, or
          (d) in any other case, a person the Chief Commissioner
          determines to be a proprietor of the business.

     charges additional duty, at the same rate as the surcharge purchaser
     duty chargeable under Chapter 2A, if the person acquiring the
     significant interest is a foreign person and the landholder concerned
     is a private landholder.

     "land holding" is an interest in land other than the estate or
     interest of a mortgagee, chargee or other secured creditor, subject
     to this section.
     (2) An interest in land is a land holding of a unit trust scheme only
     to the extent that the interest is held by the trustee of the unit
     trust scheme in its capacity as trustee of the scheme, by a custodian
     of the trustee of the unit trust scheme in its capacity as custodian
     or by a sub-custodian of the custodian of the trustee of the unit
     trust scheme in its capacity as sub-custodian.
     (3) An interest in land is not a land holding of a company if the
     company holds the land on trust, but only if the company is not a
     beneficiary of the trust.
     (4) This section is in aid of, but does not limit, the operation of
     any provision of this Chapter providing for constructive ownership of
     interests.

     Dictionary.

Section 147A
What does "land" include?
 
 
147A What does "land" include?
     (1) For the purposes of this Chapter,
     "land" includes anything fixed to the land, whether or not the thing-
     -
          (a) constitutes a fixture at law, or
          (b) is owned separately from the land, or
          (c) is notionally severed or considered to be legally
          separate from the land as a result of the operation of any
          other Act or law.
     (2) Land does not include anything excluded under section 163K from
     the definition of
     "goods" in this Chapter.
     (3) The Chief Commissioner may determine that land does not include a
     thing fixed to land if--

          land.

Section 149
What is a "relevant acquisition"?
 
 
149 What is a "relevant acquisition"?
     (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a person makes a
     "relevant acquisition" if the person--
          (a) acquires an interest in a landholder that is of itself
          a significant interest in the landholder, or
          (b) acquires an interest in a landholder that (when
          aggregated with other interests in the landholder held by
          the person or an associated person) results in an
          aggregation that amounts to a significant interest in the
          landholder, or
          (c) already having a significant interest, or an interest
          described in paragraph (b), in a landholder, acquires a
          further interest in the landholder.
     (1A) For the purposes of this Chapter, a person also makes a
     "relevant acquisition" if the person acquires an interest in a
     landholder that (when aggregated with other interests in the
     landholder acquired by the person or other persons under acquisitions
     that form, evidence, give effect to or arise from what is
     substantially one arrangement between the acquirers) results in an
     aggregation that amounts to a significant interest in the landholder.
     (1B) In determining whether acquisitions form, evidence, give effect
     to or arise from what is substantially one arrangement between the
     acquirers, the following circumstances are to be taken into account--
          (a) whether any of the acquisitions are conditional on
          entry into, or completion of, any of the other
          acquisitions,
          (b) whether the parties to any of the acquisitions are the
          same,
          (c) whether any party to an acquisition is an associated
          person of another party to any of the other acquisitions,
          (d) the period of time over which the acquisitions take
          place,
          (e) whether, before or after the acquisitions take place,
          the interests were, are or will be used together or
          dependently with one another,
          (f) any other relevant circumstances.
     (2) An acquisition of an interest in a private landholder under an
     arrangement that results in the private landholder ceasing to be a
     private landholder is not a relevant acquisition because of
     subsection (1A).
     (3) If a person who acquires or holds an interest in a landholder is
     a trustee for 2 or more trusts, any interests in the landholder
     acquired or held by the person for different trusts are to be treated
     as if they were acquired or held independently by separate persons.
     (4) If a person who acquires or holds an interest in a landholder is
     a life company, any interests in the landholder acquired or held by
     the life company for different statutory funds are to be treated as
     if they were acquired or held independently by separate persons.
     (5) If a life company acquires or holds an interest in a landholder
     otherwise than for a statutory fund, that interest is to be treated
     as if it were acquired or held independently of, and by a separate
     person to, any interest acquired or held by the life company for a
     statutory fund.
     (6) In this section--

     "statutory fund" has the meaning given by the Life Insurance Act 1995
     of the Commonwealth.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 150
What are "interests" and "significant interests" in landholders?
 
 
150 What are "interests" and "significant interests" in landholders?
     (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a person has an
     "interest" in a landholder if the person, in the event of a
     distribution of all the property of the landholder, would be entitled
     (without regard to any liabilities of the landholder) to any of the
     property distributed.
     (1A) However, an entitlement that arises merely because a person has
     a debt interest in a landholder, is not an interest in a landholder.
     (2) A person who has an interest in a landholder has a
     "significant interest" in the landholder if the person, in the event
     of a distribution of all the property of the landholder immediately
     after the interest was acquired, would be entitled (without regard to
     any liabilities of the landholder) to--
          (a) for a private landholder that is a private unit trust
          scheme--20% or more of the property distributed, or
          (b) otherwise for a private landholder--50% or more of the
          property distributed, or
          (c) for a public landholder--90% or more of the property
          distributed.
     (3) An interest in a landholder that was acquired at a time when the
     landholder did not hold land in New South Wales is not counted during
     the period of 12 months after the landholder first holds land in New
     South Wales.
     (4) In determining whether a person has a significant interest in a
     landholder, a distribution of property to any person in the person's
     capacity as the holder of a debt interest is to be disregarded.
     (5) In this section--

     "debt interest" has the same meaning as it has in Division 974 of the
     Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 of the Commonwealth.

     "person" includes a landholder.

     "private unit trust scheme" has the same meaning as in Division 2.

     interest increases, in the landholder regardless of how it is
     obtained or increased.
     (2) Without limiting subsection (1), a person may acquire an interest
     in a landholder in the following ways--
          (a) the purchase, gift or issue of a unit or share,
          (b) the cancellation, redemption or surrender of a unit or
          share,
          (c) the abrogation or alteration of a right for a unit or
          share,
          (d) the payment of an amount owing for a unit or share,
          (e) if the person holds an interest in the landholder
          (whether or not as trustee for another person) and the
          capacity in which the person holds the interest changes
          (including if there is a change in the beneficial ownership
          of an interest held by a person as trustee).
               Note : For example, the capacity in which a
               person holds a unit or share in a landholder
               changes if the person declares a trust in respect
               of the unit or share.
     (3) To remove any doubt, it is declared that a person may acquire an
     interest in a landholder without acquiring units or shares in the
     landholder.

Acquisition statements
 
 
152 Acquisition statements
     (1) A person who has made a relevant acquisition must prepare a
     statement (an
     "acquisition statement") and lodge it with the Chief Commissioner
     within 3 months after the relevant acquisition is made.
     (2) The acquisition statement is to be prepared in an approved form
     and must contain the following information--
          (a) the name and address of the person who has acquired the
          interest,
          (b) in relation to each interest acquired, the date on
          which it was acquired,
          (c) if the relevant acquisition results from the
          aggregation of the interests of associated persons,
          particulars of the interests acquired by the person and any
          associated persons on the date of the relevant acquisition,
          (d) particulars of the total interest of the person and any
          associated person in the landholder at that date.
     (3) The acquisition statement must also contain the following
     additional information--
          (a) the unencumbered value of all land holdings and goods
          in New South Wales of the landholder as at the date of the
          relevant acquisition and, if the landholder is a private
          landholder, as at the date of acquisition of each interest
          acquired in the landholder during the statement period,
          (b) such other information as the Chief Commissioner may
          require.
     (4) The additional information referred to in subsection (3) is not
     required in relation to any exempt acquisition.
     (5) The
     "statement period" is the period commencing 3 years before the date
     of the relevant acquisition and ending on the date of the relevant
     acquisition.
     (6) However, if the relevant acquisition is related to an acquisition
     of an interest in the landholder that was made before the start of
     that 3-year period (an
     "earlier acquisition"), the statement period is the period commencing
     on the date that earlier acquisition was made (or, if there is more
     than one, the first of them) and ending on the date of the relevant
     acquisition.
     (7) For the purposes of this section, a relevant acquisition is
     related to an earlier acquisition if it is made as a result of an
     arrangement entered into at the time of, or in connection with, the
     earlier acquisition.
     Note : In ascertaining whether or not a liability to lodge a
     statement under this section exists, it is necessary to have regard
     to provisions of Part 3 that deal with how a person may be taken to
     have acquired an interest in a landholder because of the interests in
     a linked entity.

     (2) However, in the case of a relevant acquisition resulting from the
     application of section 161 (1) and (2AA) to an agreement to purchase
     or issue a share in a landholder, a tax default does not occur for
     the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 if duty is paid
     within 3 months after the agreement is completed.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 154
Who is liable to pay the duty?
 
 
154 Who is liable to pay the duty?
     (1) The following persons are jointly and severally liable to pay
     duty chargeable under this Part--
          (a) the person who makes the relevant acquisition,
          (b) the landholder or, if the landholder is a unit trust
          scheme, the trustee of the landholder,
          (c) if the relevant acquisition results from an aggregation
          of the interests of the person referred to in paragraph (a)
          and other persons--each of those other persons.
     (2) A person who pays an amount of duty chargeable under this Part is
     entitled to recover as a debt the amount paid (together with any
     penalty or interest paid by the person in respect of that duty) from
     another person who is jointly and severally liable to pay the duty,
     as follows--
          (a) the landholder or trustee of the landholder is entitled
          to recover from a person referred to in subsection (1)(a)
          or (c),
          (b) the person who makes the relevant acquisition is
          entitled to recover from the other persons referred to in
          subsection (1)(c) (but not from the landholder or trustee
          of the landholder) with recovery from each of those other
          persons limited to an amount that is proportionate to the
          interest of the other person,
          (c) a person referred to in subsection (1)(c) is not
          entitled to recover.
     (3) Any liability of a landholder, or the trustee of a landholder, to
     pay duty chargeable under this Part (together with any interest or
     penalty tax payable) is a charge on the land holdings of the
     landholder or trustee.
     (4) A charge created by this section gives the Chief Commissioner an
     interest in the land and, accordingly, the Chief Commissioner may
     lodge a caveat in respect of the land under the Real Property Act
     1900 to protect that interest.
     (5) A caveat must be withdrawn when the amount of the duty for which
     the landholder or trustee is liable (together with any interest or
     penalty tax payable) has been paid.
     (6) Section 45(3) of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 (which
     relates to rights of contribution or indemnity between persons who
     are jointly and severally liable for duty) does not apply to joint
     and several liability under this section.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 155
How duty is charged on relevant acquisitions--private landholders
 
 
155 How duty is charged on relevant acquisitions--private landholders
     (1) If an acquisition statement that discloses a relevant acquisition
     in a private landholder does not disclose any other acquisitions
     during the statement period, duty is chargeable, at the general rate,
     on the amount calculated by multiplying the unencumbered value of all
     land holdings and goods of the landholder in New South Wales
     (calculated at the date of acquisition of the interest acquired) by
     the proportion of that value represented by the interest acquired in
     the relevant acquisition.
     (2) If a relevant acquisition results from the aggregation of the
     interests of associated persons, the reference in subsection (1) to
     the interest acquired includes a reference to any interests acquired
     by associated persons on the same date.
     (3) If an acquisition statement disclosing a relevant acquisition in
     a private landholder also discloses one or more other acquisitions
     during the statement period, duty is chargeable, at the general rate,
     on the aggregate of amounts severally calculated, in the manner
     provided by subsection (1), in respect of each interest required to
     be disclosed in the statement.
     (4) Duty payable under this section is to be reduced by the sum of
     the duty paid or payable under this Act in respect of an acquisition,
     during the statement period, by the person or any associated person
     of an interest in the same landholder, but only in proportion to the
     extent to which the duty paid or payable is attributable to the
     amount of the duty payable under this section.
     (5) Duty payable under this section is to be reduced by the sum of
     the amounts severally calculated, in accordance with the following
     formula, in respect of each acquisition of an interest in the
     landholder made by the person, or an associated person, during the
     statement period--

          "A" is the unencumbered value of the land holdings and
          goods in New South Wales of the landholder at the time the
          acquisition was made, and

          "B" is the unencumbered value of all property of the
          landholder at that time, and

          "C" is the sum of--
               (a) the duty under this Act paid or payable in
               respect of--
                    (i) a dutiable transaction in relation
                    to the units or shares acquired, or
                    (ii) a capital reduction or a rights
                    alteration under Part 3 of Chapter 3 by
                    which an interest in the landholder was
                    acquired, or
                    (iii) an allotment of shares under Part
                    5 of Chapter 3 by which an interest in
                    the landholder was acquired, and
               (b) any duty of a like nature so paid or payable
               under a law of another Australian jurisdiction.
     (6) If a relevant acquisition is made owing to the aggregation of the
     interests of associated persons, but the Chief Commissioner is
     satisfied that the associated persons acquired their respective
     interests independently, the Chief Commissioner may assess and charge
     duty on each separate acquisition without aggregating the interests
     of the person who made it with the interests of associated persons.
     (7) Duty is not chargeable under this section on the acquisition of
     an interest in a landholder that is required to be disclosed in an
     acquisition statement if the acquisition is an exempt acquisition.
     (8) This section is subject to Part 3.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 156
How duty is charged on relevant acquisitions--public landholders
 
 
156 How duty is charged on relevant acquisitions--public landholders
     (1) If an acquisition statement discloses a relevant acquisition in a
     public landholder, the duty chargeable on the relevant acquisition is
     the duty that would be chargeable, at the general rate, on a transfer
     of all the land holdings and goods of the landholder in New South
     Wales (calculated as if the transfer had occurred at the date of
     relevant acquisition).
     (2) For that purpose, the dutiable value of the land holdings and
     goods is the unencumbered value of land holdings and goods at the
     date of the relevant acquisition.
     (3) If an acquisition disclosed in an acquisition statement is an
     exempt acquisition, the duty chargeable under this section is to be
     calculated after deducting from the dutiable value of the land
     holdings and goods the proportion of that value represented by the
     value of the interest acquired in the exempt acquisition.
     (4) If the public landholder is a widely held trust, the duty payable
     under this section is also to be reduced by the following amounts (if
     applicable)--
          (a) the amount of duty under this Act paid or payable in
          respect of a dutiable transaction in relation to the units
          concerned,
          (b) the amount of any duty of a like nature so paid or
          payable under a law of another Australian jurisdiction.
     (5) If duty is chargeable in respect of a relevant acquisition made
     by a person in a public landholder, no duty is chargeable in respect
     of any further acquisition made by that person in that landholder.
     (6) This section is subject to Part 3.

Section 157B
Beneficial owner--meaning
 
 
157B Beneficial owner--meaning
     (1) If a person who acquires or holds an interest in a landholder
     acquires or holds that interest as bare trustee for another person,
     the other person is a
     "beneficial owner" of that interest in the landholder.
     (2) If a person who is a beneficial owner of an interest in a
     landholder (whether as a result of subsection (1) or as a result of
     one or more applications of this subsection) holds that interest as
     bare trustee for another person, that other person is also a
     "beneficial owner" of that interest in the landholder.
     (3) For the purposes of this Part, the
     "ultimate beneficial owner" of an interest in a landholder is any
     beneficial owner of the interest in the landholder who does not hold
     that interest as bare trustee for another person.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 157C
Beneficial owners liable for duty on acquisitions in landholders
 
 
157C Beneficial owners liable for duty on acquisitions in landholders
     (1) Any interest in a landholder that is acquired or held by a person
     (the
     "legal owner") as bare trustee for another person is taken, for the
     purposes of this Chapter, to have been acquired by, or to be held by,
     the ultimate beneficial owner of the interest in the landholder,
     rather than the legal owner.
     (2) Accordingly, the ultimate beneficial owner of an interest
     acquired by the legal owner will be liable to lodge an acquisition
     statement, and to pay any duty chargeable under this Chapter, in
     respect of any relevant acquisition made as a result of that
     acquisition by the legal owner.
          Note : For example, A acquires an interest in a landholder
          as bare trustee for B. A is the legal owner and B is a
          beneficial owner of the interest in the landholder. B holds
          that interest as bare trustee for C. As a result, C is also
          a beneficial owner of the interest in the landholder
          acquired by A. If C does not hold the interest as bare
          trustee for another person, C is the ultimate beneficial
          owner of the interest and will be liable for any duty
          chargeable on the acquisition.
     (3) For the purpose of determining whether an acquisition is a
     relevant acquisition, section 149 applies as if a reference to a
     person who acquires or holds an interest in a landholder were a
     reference to the ultimate beneficial owner of the interest, rather
     than the legal owner.
     (4) That is, the acquisition is to be aggregated with other interests
     held by the ultimate beneficial owner of the interest or an
     associated person of the ultimate beneficial owner of the interest,
     rather than with other interests held by the legal owner or
     associated persons of the legal owner.

How duty is charged on relevant acquisitions by foreign persons
 
 
157H How duty is charged on relevant acquisitions by foreign persons
     (1) If an acquisition statement that discloses a relevant acquisition
     in a private landholder does not disclose any other acquisitions by a
     foreign person during the statement period, duty is chargeable, at 9%
     (
     "the general surcharge rate"), on the amount calculated by
     multiplying the unencumbered value of all residential land holdings
     of the landholder in New South Wales (calculated at the date of
     acquisition of the interest acquired) by the proportion of that value
     represented by the interest acquired in the relevant acquisition.
     (2) If a relevant acquisition results from the aggregation of the
     interests of associated persons who are foreign persons, the
     reference in subsection (1) to the interest acquired includes a
     reference to any interests acquired by any such associated persons on
     the same date.
     (3) If an acquisition statement disclosing a relevant acquisition in
     a private landholder also discloses one or more other acquisitions by
     a foreign person during the statement period, duty is chargeable, at
     the general surcharge rate, on the aggregate of amounts severally
     calculated, in the manner provided by subsection (1), in respect of
     each interest required to be disclosed in the statement that is an
     interest of a foreign person.
     (4) Duty payable under this Part is to be reduced by the sum of the
     duty paid or payable under this Part in respect of an acquisition,
     during the statement period, by the foreign person or any associated
     person who is a foreign person of an interest in the same landholder,
     but only in proportion to the extent to which the duty paid or
     payable is attributable to the amount of the duty payable under this
     Part.
     (5) Duty is not chargeable under this Part on the acquisition of an
     interest in a landholder that is required to be disclosed in an
     acquisition statement if the acquisition is an exempt acquisition.

          the purchase or interest acquired by the person were
          registered on the agreement liability date), and
          (b) in the case of an agreement to purchase a share or
          unit, the registered interest of the vendor in the unit or
          share is to be disregarded.
          Note : Accordingly, the purchaser or person to whom a share
          or unit is issued under an agreement for the sale or issue
          of a share or unit in a landholder acquires an interest in
          the landholder on the agreement liability date.

     date and is not a landholder on the agreement liability date as
     determined under that subsection.
     (2A) If--
          (a) at the time of acquisition of an interest by any person
          in a landholder that necessitates the lodgment of an
          acquisition statement under this Chapter, the person was
          the purchaser or person to whom a unit or share was to be
          issued under an uncompleted agreement for the purchase or
          issue of a share or unit in a landholder, and
          (b) the agreement is subsequently rescinded, annulled or
          otherwise terminated without completion,
     the Chief Commissioner is to assess or reassess the statement on the
     basis that the purchaser or person to whom the unit or share was to
     be issued did not have an interest in the landholder as a result of
     the agreement.
     (3) This section does not apply in respect of shares or units in a

     holdings or goods that has the effect of reducing the unencumbered
     value is to be disregarded, subject to subsection (3).
     (3) An arrangement is not to be disregarded if the Chief Commissioner
     is satisfied that the arrangement was not made as part of an
     arrangement or scheme with a collateral purpose of reducing the duty
     otherwise payable in relation to the relevant acquisition.
     (4) In considering whether or not he or she is satisfied for the
     purposes of subsection (3), the Chief Commissioner may have regard
     to--
          (a) the duration of the arrangement before the relevant
          acquisition, and
          (b) whether the arrangement has been made with an
          associated person, and

          of the arrangement other than to reduce duty, and

     carried out in accordance with the constitution of the landholder,
     and with any law relevant to the distribution, as in force at the
     time of distribution, and the entitlement of the interested person is
     to be evaluated accordingly.
     (3) Next, a calculation is to be made based on a distribution carried
     out after the interested person, and any other person whom the
     interested person has power to direct with respect to such a
     distribution or who is, in relation to the interested person, an
     associated person, had exercised all powers and discretions
     exercisable by them by reason of having acquired an interest in the
     landholder concerned--
          (a) to effect or compel an alteration to the constitution
          of the landholder, and
          (b) to vary the rights conferred by units or shares in the
          landholder, and
          (c) to effect or compel the substitution or replacement of
          units or shares in the landholder with other units or
          shares in it,
     in such a manner as would maximise the value of the entitlement, and
     the entitlement of the interested person is to be evaluated
     accordingly.
     (4) The results obtained by an evaluation of the interested person's
     entitlement in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) are then to be
     compared, and whichever evaluation results in a greater entitlement
     is the correct evaluation, for the purposes of this Chapter, of the
     entitlement, unless the Chief Commissioner, being satisfied that the
     application of this subsection in the particular case would be
     inequitable, determines otherwise.

163D Concession for primary producers--continuation of land rich requirement
     (1) Duty is chargeable under this Chapter in respect of an
     acquisition of an interest in a primary producer only if, when the
     acquisition is made, the primary producer is land rich.
     (2) For the purposes of this section, a
     "primary producer" is a landholder whose land holdings in all places,
     whether within or outside Australia, wholly or predominantly comprise
     land used for primary production or land that would be considered to
     be land used for primary production if it were land in New South
     Wales.
     (3) A primary producer is
     "land rich" if--
          (a) it has land holdings in New South Wales with an
          unencumbered value of $2,000,000 or more, and
          (b) its land holdings in all places, whether within or
          outside Australia, comprise 80% or more of the unencumbered
          value of all its property.

     of an interest in a primary producer is made, the landholder in whom
     the acquisition is made ceases for any length of time to be a primary
     producer--
          (a) the person who made the acquisition must immediately
          notify the Chief Commissioner--
               (i) that the landholder has ceased to be a
               primary producer, and
               (ii) of the date on which the landholder ceased
               to be a primary producer, and
          (b) duty is chargeable under this Chapter in respect of the
          acquisition on the date on which the landholder ceased to
          be a primary producer, and

          duty so chargeable.
     (5) Property is not to be counted in calculating the unencumbered
     value of the property of a primary producer for the purposes of this
     section if the primary producer is unable to satisfy the Chief
     Commissioner that the property was obtained otherwise than to reduce,
     for the purposes of this Chapter, the ratio of its land holdings in
     all places, whether within or outside Australia, to the unencumbered
     value of all its property.

     (2) The statement is chargeable with duty at the expiration of the
     period of 5 years after the date of the acquisition (or such longer
     period as may be determined by the Chief Commissioner in the
     particular case) if the interest concerned is not--
          (a) re-acquired by the person from whom it was acquired, or

          (c) as a result of the redemption, the scheme would, but

          unit holder, individually or together with any associated
          person, is entitled to more than 20% of the units in the
          trust.
     (2) For a period of 30 days beginning on and including the day on
     which the redemption occurs, the trust is taken to continue to be a
     widely held trust, but only if the trust continues to have not less
     than 300 unit holders none of whom, individually or together with any
     associated person, is entitled to more than 25% of the units of the
     trust.
     (3) If, at the end of that 30-day period, a unit holder, individually
     or together with any associated person, is entitled to more than 20%
     of the units in the unit trust scheme--
          (a) the trust is taken to have ceased to be a widely held
          trust from the beginning of that 30-day period (as if
          subsection (2) had never applied), and
          (b) the Chief Commissioner must make an assessment of the
          duty chargeable under this Act as if the unit trust scheme
          had ceased to be a widely held trust scheme at the
          beginning on that 30-day period, and
          (c) a tax default occurs for the purposes of the Taxation
          Administration Act 1996 if the whole of any duty assessed
          under paragraph (b) is not paid to the Chief Commissioner
          within 3 months after the assessment.

     (2) This section applies regardless of when the other instruments of
     security were first executed.
     (3) Duty on a mortgage package is to be assessed under this Part as
     if the instruments comprising the mortgage package, to the extent
     that they secure the same moneys, were a single mortgage.
     (4) One of the mortgages in the mortgage package is to be stamped, or
     upstamped, with any ad valorem duty paid under this Act for the
     mortgage package and each other mortgage in the mortgage package is
     to be stamped as a collateral mortgage.
     (5) If any of the mortgages in the mortgage package partly secures
     other moneys, that mortgage is to continue to be treated as a
     separate mortgage under this Chapter in respect of the other moneys
     that it secures and may be stamped for the duty chargeable in respect
     of those other moneys.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 215
Contingent liabilities
 
 
215 Contingent liabilities
     (1) A mortgage that is used or is capable of being used (whether
     directly or through a chain of relationships) to recover the whole or
     any part of an amount contingently payable in connection with an
     advance--
          (a) by a guarantor or indemnifying party under a guarantee
          or indemnity, or
          (b) by another party under another instrument of a
          different kind,
     is liable to duty as if the amount of the contingent liability under
     the guarantee, indemnity or other instrument (or, where there is more
     than one guarantee, indemnity or other instrument, the greatest
     contingent liability) were a separate advance made under the
     agreement, understanding or arrangement for which the mortgage is
     security.
     (2) In the case of a mortgage that is part of a chain of
     relationships referred to in subsection (1), a reference in that
     subsection to a contingent liability is a reference to a contingent
     liability limited to the amount of any advance by any party in the
     chain, and does not include a reference to any other kind of
     contingent liability.
     (3) This section does not apply if the Chief Commissioner is
     satisfied that there is no connection between the mortgage and any
     advance by any party to the arrangements.
     (4) Nothing in this section requires duty to be paid more than once
     in respect of an advance.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 216
Mortgages over property not wholly within New South Wales
 
 
216 Mortgages over property not wholly within New South Wales
     (1) Mortgage duty is to be assessed for a mortgage over property that
     is partly within and partly outside New South Wales as if the amount
     secured by the mortgage were only the dutiable proportion.
     (2) The
     "dutiable proportion" is to be calculated in accordance with the
     following formula--

          "DP" is the dutiable proportion.

          "AS" is the amount secured by the mortgage on which duty
          would, but for this section, be charged at the liability
          date.

          "V" is the value of the property in New South Wales
          affected by the mortgage.

          "T" is the value of all property affected by the mortgage.
     (3) The dutiable proportion is to be calculated by reference to any
     relevant document that provides, or relevant documents that together
     provide, the value of all property affected by the mortgage, subject
     to this section.
     (4) A
     "relevant document" is any of the following prepared within 12 months
     before the liability date for the mortgage--
          (a) an independent valuation of the secured property,
          (b) a statement of the mortgagee based on information
          obtained by the mortgagee in deciding to make the advance
          to the mortgagor,
          (c) property valuations used by the mortgagor in preparing
          an annual return to be lodged under the Corporations Act
          2001 of the Commonwealth,
          (d) a financial report of the mortgagor or a group of which
          the mortgagor is a member, certified by an independent
          auditor as presenting a true and fair view of a
          corporation's or group's financial position,
          (e) agreed property valuations that form the basis of the
          mortgagor's insurance policies,
          (f) another document the Chief Commissioner considers to be
          appropriate for calculating the dutiable proportion.
     (5) If more than one relevant document is available for determining
     the value of the same property, the Chief Commissioner is to give
     preference to the most recently prepared document, subject to this
     section.
     (6) If a mortgagor is a member of a group, and a financial report
     comprising the consolidated accounts of the group is available, and
     is a relevant document, the dutiable proportion is to be calculated
     primarily by reference to that relevant document, unless the Chief
     Commissioner does not consider it appropriate to do so. In such a
     case, the only debt or equity to be taken into account in calculating
     the dutiable proportion is the debt and equity as disclosed in that
     financial report.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 216A
Calculation of dutiable proportion--goodwill and intellectual property
 
 
216A Calculation of dutiable proportion--goodwill and intellectual property
For the purposes of this Chapter, if the property secured by a mortgage
includes the goodwill of a business or intellectual property, the goodwill or
intellectual property is taken to be property in New South Wales to the extent
that it would have comprised a business asset under Chapter 2 if it had been
transferred to the mortgagor immediately before the liability date, which has a
value equivalent to the dutiable value of such a transfer.

Security
 
 
218A Security
     (1) A stamped mortgage or a collateral mortgage that was, but is no
     longer, part of the same mortgage package and no longer secures the
     same money secured by that package is not security for any other
     advance unless duty in respect of the other advance has been paid.
     (2) The withdrawal of a mortgage from a mortgage package will not,
     for the purposes of this Chapter, affect the amount for which the
     remaining mortgage or mortgages are security.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 218C
Multi-jurisdictional statement
 
 
218C Multi-jurisdictional statement
     (1) If mortgage duty is imposed on the dutiable proportion of a
     mortgage (whether for a mortgage over property not wholly in New
     South Wales, a mortgage package or on initial or subsequent
     advances), the mortgagor and mortgagee must, within 3 months after
     the liability arises--
          (a) make a written statement, in an approved form, about
          the location and value of the secured property, and
          (b) lodge the statement with the Chief Commissioner.
          : Maximum penalty--100 penalty units.
          Note : An offence against subsection (1) committed by a
          corporation is an executive liability offence attracting
          executive liability for a director or other person involved
          in the management of the corporation--see section 121 of
          the Taxation Administration Act 1996.
     (2) The making and lodging of a statement under subsection (1) by
     either the mortgagor or the mortgagee relieves the other person from
     complying with that subsection.
     (3) The statement may be taken to be the mortgage, or mortgages
     comprising the mortgage package.
 

DUTIES ACT 1997
Section 218D
Concession for advances charged with duty under corresponding Acts
 
 
218D Concession for advances charged with duty under corresponding Acts
     (1) If the total of the amount of ad valorem duty chargeable under
     this Act in respect of the amount secured by a mortgage at a
     liability date and the amount of duty paid under a corresponding Act
     in respect of the mortgage exceeds the maximum duty charge in respect
     of the mortgage, the amount of ad valorem duty chargeable on the
     mortgage at the liability date is to be reduced by the amount
     necessary to ensure that the maximum duty charge is not exceeded.
     (2) The
     "maximum duty charge" in respect of the mortgage is the amount of ad
     valorem duty that would be chargeable in respect of the amount
     secured by the mortgage at the liability date if--
          (a) it were a single mortgage over property wholly within
          New South Wales (that is, disregarding section 216), and
          (b) it had not previously been stamped under this Act for
          any ad valorem duty.
     (3) The amount of duty paid under a corresponding Act in respect of
     the mortgage is the total of all ad valorem duty already paid in
     respect of the amount secured by the mortgage under any corresponding
     Act.
     (4) If a mortgage has already been duly stamped under this Act for an
     amount of duty, any reduction in the amount of duty chargeable on the
     mortgage at the liability date that is made under section 210 (3) is
     to be made after making any reduction required by this section.
     (5) To avoid doubt, this section extends to a mortgage package
     assessed as a single mortgage.

          (b) is created to secure an advance to the same borrower as
          under the earlier mortgage, and
          (c) is over the same or substantially the same property or
          part of the property as the earlier mortgage.
     (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), mortgages are created to
     secure an advance to the same borrower if, either directly by the
     mortgages themselves or indirectly through one or more collateral
     arrangements, the same person obtains the advances secured by them.
     (3) A refinancing mortgage is taken to have been stamped with ad
     valorem duty as a mortgage in respect of the duty-free refinancing
     amount, except as provided by subsection (5).
     (3A) For the purposes of this section, the
     "duty-free refinancing amount" is the lesser of the following
     amounts--
          (a) the amount secured by the earlier mortgage on which
          duty has been paid under this Act or in relation to which
          an exemption from duty has been obtained,
          (b) $1,000,000.
     (3B) However, if the refinancing mortgage is over land used for
     primary production or land used for aquaculture, the
     "duty-free refinancing amount" is the maximum amount payable under or
     secured by the earlier mortgage (being an amount in relation to which
     mortgage duty has been paid or in relation to which an exemption from
     duty has been obtained).
          Note : "Land used for primary production" is defined in the
          Dictionary.
     (4) If an advance is refinanced by more than one lender, so that
     mortgages given to the lenders together secure the balance
     outstanding under an earlier mortgage, the definition of
     "refinancing mortgage" in subsection (1) is to be construed as
     though--
          (a) the reference to a mortgage securing the outstanding
          balance were a reference to the aggregate of such
          mortgages, and
          (b) the reference to property were a reference to the
          property securing the aggregate of refinancing advances
          made by the lenders under their combined mortgages, to the
          intent that, if the requirements of the definition, as so
          construed, are satisfied, each lender is taken, for the
          purposes of this section, to be the holder of a refinancing
          mortgage.
     (5) If, as provided by subsection (4), each of a number of lenders is
     the holder of a refinancing mortgage, a refinancing mortgage held by
     each lender is taken to have been duly stamped with ad valorem duty
     as a mortgage in respect of an amount equal to the same proportion of
     the duty-free refinancing amount as the amount secured by that
     mortgage bears to the total amount secured by the refinancing
     mortgages held by all the lenders.
     (6) If each of two or more refinancing mortgages severally secures
     the same advance--
          (a) the provisions of subsection (3) or (5), as the case
          may be, apply to such one of the mortgages as the Chief
          Commissioner determines, and
          (b) no duty is chargeable in respect of any of the others.
     (8) Duty at the rate of $4 per $1,000 or remaining part of $1,000 is
     payable on the amount by which the advance made under a refinancing
     mortgage (not being a mortgage on which, by virtue of subsection (6)
     (b), no duty is chargeable) exceeds--
          (a) the duty-free refinancing amount, or
          (b) the proportion of that amount referred to in subsection
          (5), in the case of a refinancing to which subsection (4)
          applies.
     (8A) If a borrower is a related body corporate of a borrower under an
     earlier mortgage, the firstmentioned borrower is taken to be the same
     borrower or the same person for the purposes of subsection (1) or
     (2).
     (9) If a borrower under an earlier mortgage dies, or is a party to a
     marriage that has been dissolved or annulled or, in the opinion of
     the Chief Commissioner, has broken down irretrievably or is party to
     a de facto relationship that, in the opinion of the Chief
     Commissioner, has been terminated, the remaining borrower is, or the
     remaining borrowers are, taken to be the same borrower or the same
     person for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2).
     (10) A party to a marriage or de facto relationship may provide a
     statement to the Chief Commissioner, in the form of a statutory
     declaration, to the effect that--
          (a) in the case of a marriage--
               (i) the party intends to apply for a dissolution
               or an annulment of the marriage, or
               (ii) the parties to the marriage have separated,
               and there is no reasonable likelihood of
               cohabitation being resumed, or
          (b) in the case of a de facto relationship, the de facto
          relationship has been terminated.
     The Chief Commissioner is required to have regard to any such
     statement in exercising his or her functions under subsection (9).
     (11) Subsection (10) does not limit the functions of the Chief
     Commissioner under section 72 of the Taxation Administration Act
     1996.

     relevant acquisition in a public landholder made as a consequence of
     a person acquiring an interest in the public landholder on or after 1

     (6) If a person acquires an interest in a public landholder on or
     after 1 October 2009, acquisitions made before 1 October 2009
     (including any made before 1 July 2009) are to be counted for the
     purpose of determining whether the person has made a relevant
     acquisition in the public landholder under new Chapter 4.
          Note : However, acquisitions made in public landholders
          before 1 July 2009 are exempt acquisitions for duty
          purposes.
     (7) Duty is not chargeable under new Chapter 4 on a relevant
     acquisition made by a person in a public landholder if the person's
     intention to make the acquisition was announced to the market before
     the date on which the Bill for the State Revenue Legislation Further
     Amendment Act 2009 was introduced into the Legislative Assembly.

          the trust have been amended, before midnight on 31 December

          the trust prevents a foreign person from being a
          beneficiary, or
          (b) if that duty has been paid, the trustee is entitled to
          a refund of that duty if the terms of the trust have been

     section is considered for the purposes of that section to prevent a

     (4) Despite section 104JA, the trustee of an Australian testamentary
     trust is not in that capacity a foreign trustee for the purposes of

     being a beneficiary of the trust) if--

     (5) The Chief Commissioner may in a particular case extend the due
     date for payment of surcharge purchaser duty by a trustee so that the
     trustee qualifies for exemption from that duty under this clause if
     the terms of the trust have been amended before midnight on 31
     December 2020 (but after the date that would otherwise be the due
     date for payment) so that the trust prevents a foreign person from
     being a beneficiary.
     (6) In this clause--

     "Australian testamentary trust" means a discretionary trust arising
     from a will or codicil or the administration of an intestate estate

     a trustee for 2 or more trusts the unit holder is to be treated as a
     separate registered unit holder in relation to each of those trusts
     and the units held under each trust are to be treated as a separate
     unit holding.
     (3) However, a trustee is not to be treated as a separate registered
     unit holder in relation to 2 or more trusts if, as separate
     registered unit holders in relation to those trusts, they would be
     associated persons.
4 Interests in land
     (1) For the purposes of this Act, a mining lease or mineral claim
     granted under the Mining Act 1992 is taken to give the holder an

     (1A) To avoid doubt, the land includes anything that, under the
     authority of the mining lease or mineral claim (whether direct or
     indirect), is fixed to the land the subject of the lease or claim and
     that would be a part of the land (as a fixture) if the lease or claim
     were an estate in fee simple in the land.

     an interest in land--
