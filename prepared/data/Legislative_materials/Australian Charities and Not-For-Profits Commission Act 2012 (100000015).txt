AUSTRALIAN CHARITIES AND NOT-FOR-PROFITS COMMISSION ACT 2012
Section 45-1
Simplified outline

  The following is a simplified outline of this Division:
This Division sets up a system to allow the creation of minimum governance standards that entities are required to meet (in order to become registered, and on an ongoing basis). These governance standards are to be set out in the regulations.Compliance with the governance standards is a condition of entitlement to registration under paragraph  25-5(3)(b).The object of the system setting up the standards is to provide a minimum level of confidence that registered entities will promote the effective and efficient use of their resources, will meet community expectations about managing their affairs and the use of public money, volunteer time and donations, and will minimise the risk of mismanagement and misappropriation.

AUSTRALIAN CHARITIES AND NOT-FOR-PROFITS COMMISSION ACT 2012
Section 45-5
Object of this Division

 (1) The object of this Division is to promote the objects of this Act by giving the public (including donors, members and volunteers of registered entities) confidence that registered entities:
 (a) manage their affairs openly, accountably and transparently; and
 (b) use their resources (including contributions and donations) effectively and efficiently; and
 (c) minimise the risk of mismanagement and misappropriation; and
 (d) pursue their purposes.
Note: The objects of this Act include supporting and sustaining a robust, vibrant, independent and innovative Australian not -for-profit sector (see subsection 15-5(1)).
 (2) This Division achieves that object by setting up a system to allow the regulations to specify standards with which an entity must comply in order to become registered under this Act, and to remain entitled to be registered under this Act.
Note 1: The main consequence of failure to comply with these standards is a loss of the entity&#39;s entitlement to registration. If the entity is a federally regulated entity, such a failure to comply may also result in enforcement action under Chapter  4.
Note 2: For the consequences of registration, see section 20-5.
Note 3: A registered entity must notify the Commissioner of significant non-compliance with these standards that results in the entity no longer being entitled to be registered (see section  65-5).

AUSTRALIAN CHARITIES AND NOT-FOR-PROFITS COMMISSION ACT 2012
Section 45-10
Regulations establishing governance standards

 (1) The regulations may specify standards (the governance standards) with which an entity must comply in order to become registered under this Act, and to remain entitled to be registered under this Act.

 (a) require the entity to ensure that its governing rules provide for a specified matter; or
 (b) require the entity to achieve specified outcomes and:
 (i) not specify how the entity is to achieve those outcomes; or
 (ii) specify principles as to how the entity is to achieve those outcomes; or
 (c) require the entity to establish and maintain processes for the purpose of ensuring specified matters.
 (2A) Without limiting subparagraph  (2)(b)(ii), the principles mentioned in that subparagraph may reflect the size of the entity, the amount and nature of contributions to the entity and the nature of the activities undertaken by the entity in pursuit of its purposes.
 (3) Without limiting the scope of subsection  (1), those standards may provide that specified requirements do not apply to specified kinds of entity.
 (4) Without limiting the scope of subsection  (1), those standards may provide that different requirements apply to different kinds of entity.
Basic religious charities

Section 50-1
Simplified outline

  The following is a simplified outline of this Division:
This Division sets up a system to allow the creation of minimum external conduct standards that entities are required to meet (in order to become registered, and on an ongoing basis). These external conduct standards are to be set out in the regulations and must deal only with: (a) matters external to Australia; or (b) matters not external to Australia but that are closely related to, or have or will have a significant impact on, entities, things or matters external to Australia.Compliance with the external conduct standards is a condition of entitlement to registration under paragraph  25-5(3)(b).

AUSTRALIAN CHARITIES AND NOT-FOR-PROFITS COMMISSION ACT 2012
Section 50-5
Object of this Division

 (1) The object of this Division is to give the public (including donors, members and volunteers of registered entities) confidence that:
 (a) funds sent outside Australia by registered entities:
 (i) are reaching legitimate beneficiaries; and
 (ii) are being used for legitimate purposes; and
 (iii) are not contributing to terrorist, or other criminal, activities; and
 (b) activities engaged in outside Australia by registered entities are not contributing to terrorist, or other criminal, activities.
 (2) This Division achieves that object by setting up a system to allow the regulations to specify standards:
 (a) with which an entity must comply in order to become registered under this Act, and to remain entitled to be registered under this Act; and
 (b) regulating funds sent outside Australia by registered entities, and activities engaged in outside Australia by registered entities.
Note 1: The main consequence of failure to comply with these standards is a loss of the entity&#39;s entitlement to registration. Such a failure to comply may also result in enforcement action under Chapter  4.
Note 2: For the consequences of registration, see section 20-5.
Note 3: A registered entity must notify the Commissioner of significant non-compliance with these standards that results in the entity no longer being entitled to be registered (see section  65-5).

AUSTRALIAN CHARITIES AND NOT-FOR-PROFITS COMMISSION ACT 2012
Section 50-10
External conduct standards

 (1) The regulations may specify standards (the external conduct standards) with which an entity must comply in order to become registered under this Act, and to remain entitled to be registered under this Act.
 (2) Without limiting the scope of subsection  (1), those standards may:
 (a) require the entity to ensure that its governing rules provide for a specified matter; or
 (b) require the entity to achieve specified outcomes and:
 (i) not specify how the entity is to achieve those outcomes; or
 (ii) specify principles as to how the entity is to achieve those outcomes; or
 (c) require the entity to establish and maintain processes for the purpose of ensuring specified matters.
 (2A) Without limiting subparagraph  (2)(b)(ii), the principles mentioned in that subparagraph may reflect the size of the entity, the amount and nature of contributions to the entity and the nature of the activities undertaken by the entity in pursuit of its purposes.
 (3) However, the external conduct standards must deal only with:
 (a) matters external to Australia; or
 (b) matters not external to Australia but that are closely related to, or have or will have a significant impact on, entities, things or matters external to Australia.

 (a) advice given to the entity or its agent by or on behalf of the Commissioner; or
 (b) general administrative practice under this Act; or
 (c) a statement in a publication approved in writing by the Commissioner;
the base penalty amount is reduced to the extent that it was caused by that treatment.

 (a) the day the Commissioner tells the entity that an examination is to be made of the entity&#39;s affairs relating to this Act; or
 (b) if the Commissioner makes a public statement requesting entities to make a voluntary disclosure by a particular earlier day about a matter that applies to its affairs--that earlier day.
 (3) If the entity voluntarily tells the Commissioner, in the approved form, about the false or misleading nature of the statement after the Commissioner tells the entity that an examination is to be conducted of the entity&#39;s affairs relating to this Act, the Commissioner may treat the entity as having done so before being told about the examination if the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so in the circumstances.

 (a) required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or
 (b) necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

AUSTRALIAN CHARITIES AND NOT-FOR-PROFITS COMMISSION ACT 2012
Section 205-5
Entities

 (1) Entity means any of the following:
 (a) an individual;
 (b) a body corporate;
 (c) a body politic;
 (d) any other unincorporated association or body of persons;
 (e) a trust.
Note: The term entity is used in a number of different but related senses. It covers all kinds of legal person. It also covers groups of legal persons, and other things, that in practice are treated as having a separate identity in the same way as a legal person does.
 (2) Paragraph (1)(d) does not include a non -entity joint venture (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997).
 (3) The trustee of a trust is taken to be an entity consisting of the person who is the trustee, or the persons who are the trustees, at any given time.
Note 1: This is because a right or obligation cannot be conferred or imposed on an entity that is not a legal person.
Note 2: The entity that is the trustee of a trust does not change merely because of a change in the person who is the trustee of the trust, or persons who are the trustees of the trust.
 (4) A legal person can have a number of different capacities in which the person does things. In each of those capacities, the person is taken to be a different entity.
Example: In addition to his or her personal capacity, an individual may be:
        (a) sole trustee of one or more trusts; and
        (b) one of a number of trustees of a further trust.
 In his or her personal capacity, he or she is one entity. As trustee of each trust, he or she is a different entity. The trustees of the further trust are a different entity again, of which the individual is a member.
 (5) If a provision refers to an entity of a particular kind, it refers to the entity in its capacity as that kind of entity, not to that entity in any other capacity.
Example: A provision that refers to a company does not cover a company in a capacity as trustee, unless it also refers to a trustee.
